Because it was handled as **Internal Transaction**!  \nHe never used Binance and **the wallet address has nothing to do with Binance**!  \n\-&gt; The Bitcoin just disappeared.  \n [https://imgur.com/jaUbLMt](https://imgur.com/jaUbLMt)\n\nSo I chatted with the Binance support, explained the situation. The support confirmed, that the address is not a binance address and that it shouldn't be an internal transaction. The support doesn't know where the bitcoin is now and why that happened. Also they don't want to refund me anything.   \nI guess it is a software bug, as an internal transaction and a normal transaction are initiated at the same way, the only difference is, that you don't have to pay a transaction fee, but at my confirmation email the fee was included, so I had no clue or any sign that an internal transaction would be made.\n\nEnglish is not my mothertongue and I'm not a crypto expert, so sorry if anything doesn't make sense.\n\nHere are the full screenshots:  \n1/5:  [https://imgur.com/fLoVazh](https://imgur.com/fLoVazh)\n\n2/5:  [https://imgur.com/4sHJnEO](https://imgur.com/4sHJnEO)\n\n3/5:  [https://imgur.com/53864WB](https://imgur.com/53864WB)\n\n4/5:  [https://imgur.com/dRrqAHj](https://imgur.com/dRrqAHj)\n\n5/5:  [https://imgur.com/tPPsGOn](https://imgur.com/tPPsGOn)",https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/koa87l/withdrawal_bug_made_my_bitcoin_vanish_caution/

Binance,kocg9g,1609512716,A Wonderful Binance Support Experience- Withdraw Suspend/Risk Management Resolved,"I was quite worried when I found my withdrawals suspended due to ""risk management"". There were plenty of people on the internet freaking out about how Binance could be a scam and they thought that their funds had been stolen. I was so confused as to how the #1 exchange in the world on CoinMarketCap based on traffic, liquidity, trading volumes, and confidence in the legitimacy of trading volumes reported could be so crooked.  \n\n\nI kept thinking about the things it could be- perhaps my account had been compromised. Perhaps Binance was somehow operated by a hyper-intelligent AI that was slowly taking people's funds in order to take over the world, etc. Lots of things ran through my head. After some reflection, I realized I had my VPN on my phone routing through Europe, which could probably look suspicious from a security standpoint.  \n\n\nI contacted the Binance support team via a support ticket, and was pleased to receive a message that they were forwarding my request to the relevant department after only 11 hours. One hour later I received a very cordial email letting me know the restriction had been lifted.  \n\n\nThanks guys and gals at Binance, you rock!  \n\n\nI explained to them what I thought happened, and they very promptly and cordially handled the issue.   \n\n\nLong story short- be nice, we're all figuring this out together.",https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/kocg9g/a_wonderful_binance_support_experience_withdraw/
