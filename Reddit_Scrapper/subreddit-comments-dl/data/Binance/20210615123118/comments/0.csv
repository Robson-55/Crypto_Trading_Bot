ghs8sjf,ko71ci,"I just had to do that today. I had a bunch of various altcoins and ended up having to open several different wallets and exchanges to get everything out of Binance. Which sucks, because I really like Binance. I do prefer it over other exchanges.  \n\nI moved a few to Bittrex, but I won't be staying there long since they will likely do the same thing soon. I'm basically consolidating all my altcoins into USDT and BTC and will transfer everything out to a hardware wallet until I find a good exchange that I can use reliably.  \n\nI really wish that Binance hadn't done what they did. They could have at least left trading open for US residents for the 14 days. These kinds of boneheaded moves are how markets crash.",1609552481,t3_ko71ci,/r/binance/comments/ko71ci/hi_im_just_getting_back_into_crypto_after_a_long/ghs8sjf/
