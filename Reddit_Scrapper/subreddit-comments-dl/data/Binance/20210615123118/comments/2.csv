ghpyz9y,kobx5g,Yes and EUR/BUSD is also an option. USDC requires an extra conversion step.,1609514591,t1_ghpul18,/r/binance/comments/kobx5g/buy_stablecoins_with_eur/ghpyz9y/

ghpv2xl,kocb82,"That certainly isn't why you are being investigated, and your oldest ticket regarding this case was created on Dec 23.

ght31ai,kocb82,"I called my bank yesterday and yes they have to report me if they don't know where the money goes. It's the law. They have been asking me continuously for a week with urgent notices.\n\nNow for the ""circus"", I got similar answers for another ticket made  November 24th. That's more than a month ago. \n\nBy the way you really sound like an idiot. You work for binance?

ghtfrcm,kocb82,that's what you get for patronizing a customer. I can use logic too. Never said it was the same issue.

ghsgthk,kocg9g,I am glad you had some lunch. I was asked to provide customer service with several videos and info regarding my account.

gqchcqu,kocg9g,"The other part is when my ticket nº 7371634 doesn't get any email response (just one email February 14th asking for some documentation) and I can't do any withdrawal since 1 complete month today. Even after completing advanced verification, sending private bank history and some official private documents.\n\nAlways getting in qeue. Binance support giving priority to my ticket and swearing I would get an answer in short time... in 24 hours... in 48 hours... but never answer and making me enter again in qeue (last one with senior support, almost 72 hours in qeue, but now I can't even see the qeue number where I am... still in qeue I think, cause I can't re-enter..\n\nBTW, I would say I avoided to be scammed by u/CustomerSP, who tried to act like binance support here in reddit and get advance of what I need.

ghr6grs,kocg9g,Pleasantly asking multiple times has provided zero results. Multiple times of providing all needed documentation and multiple replies that the verification has been approved but no updates to my account is beyond annoying and Im not a lone wolf with this issue.
