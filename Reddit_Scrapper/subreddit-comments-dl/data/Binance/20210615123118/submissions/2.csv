kocg9g,1609512716,A Wonderful Binance Support Experience- Withdraw Suspend/Risk Management Resolved,"I was quite worried when I found my withdrawals suspended due to ""risk management"". There were plenty of people on the internet freaking out about how Binance could be a scam and they thought that their funds had been stolen. I was so confused as to how the #1 exchange in the world on CoinMarketCap based on traffic, liquidity, trading volumes, and confidence in the legitimacy of trading volumes reported could be so crooked.  \n\n\nI kept thinking about the things it could be- perhaps my account had been compromised. Perhaps Binance was somehow operated by a hyper-intelligent AI that was slowly taking people's funds in order to take over the world, etc. Lots of things ran through my head. After some reflection, I realized I had my VPN on my phone routing through Europe, which could probably look suspicious from a security standpoint.  \n\n\nI contacted the Binance support team via a support ticket, and was pleased to receive a message that they were forwarding my request to the relevant department after only 11 hours. One hour later I received a very cordial email letting me know the restriction had been lifted.  \n\n\nThanks guys and gals at Binance, you rock!  \n\n\nI explained to them what I thought happened, and they very promptly and cordially handled the issue.   \n\n\nLong story short- be nice, we're all figuring this out together.",https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/kocg9g/a_wonderful_binance_support_experience_withdraw/

kocrfg,1609513919,How does investment in Liquidity Swap work?,"I've recently started investing in the liquidity swap but i'm clueless on how it works. Sometimes the PNL can be $1, sometimes $20, and drop back to $3, and now it's $52. Actually when does it actually generate more? What more people swap the pair? When market is bullish? What happens if the market is bearish but people are still swapping the pair? Does it mean my pnl will drop or increase?
