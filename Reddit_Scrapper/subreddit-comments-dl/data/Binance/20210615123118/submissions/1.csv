koa87l,1609502534,Withdrawal Bug Made My Bitcoin Vanish. Caution!,"I already chatted with the live support from Binance, which couldn't help me and allowed me to use screenshots of our conversation.   \nI will write a summary first and then link the full screenshot.\n\nI wanted to send someone some bitcoins. I used the Binance app for that. I don't know if he would like to have his address leaked, so I will censor it.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/SwogwZU](https://imgur.com/a/SwogwZU)  \nI wanted to sent him \~70USD in bitcoin + 0.0005 BTC as Transaction Fee.\n\n [https://imgur.com/43UNACo](https://imgur.com/43UNACo)  \nThe confirmation email also had the Transaction Fee included, everything seemed right, so I confirmed.\n\n [https://imgur.com/GOepvUK](https://imgur.com/GOepvUK)\n\nHe never received anything. Why? Because it was handled as **Internal Transaction**!  \nHe never used Binance and **the wallet address has nothing to do with Binance**!  \n\-&gt; The Bitcoin just disappeared.  \n [https://imgur.com/jaUbLMt](https://imgur.com/jaUbLMt)\n\nSo I chatted with the Binance support, explained the situation. The support confirmed, that the address is not a binance address and that it shouldn't be an internal transaction. The support doesn't know where the bitcoin is now and why that happened. Also they don't want to refund me anything.   \nI guess it is a software bug, as an internal transaction and a normal transaction are initiated at the same way, the only difference is, that you don't have to pay a transaction fee, but at my confirmation email the fee was included, so I had no clue or any sign that an internal transaction would be made.\n\nEnglish is not my mothertongue and I'm not a crypto expert, so sorry if anything doesn't make sense.\n\nHere are the full screenshots:  \n1/5:  [https://imgur.com/fLoVazh](https://imgur.com/fLoVazh)\n\n2/5:  [https://imgur.com/4sHJnEO](https://imgur.com/4sHJnEO)\n\n3/5:  [https://imgur.com/53864WB](https://imgur.com/53864WB)\n\n4/5:  [https://imgur.com/dRrqAHj](https://imgur.com/dRrqAHj)\n\n5/5:  [https://imgur.com/tPPsGOn](https://imgur.com/tPPsGOn)",https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/koa87l/withdrawal_bug_made_my_bitcoin_vanish_caution/
