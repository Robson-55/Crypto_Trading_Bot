I'm currently working on a platform and would need your help, ...perhaps I use incorrect terminology of coders, but I hope you will know what I'm asking for.\n\n Does anyone know of a depository/hub/or other places where I could find a smart contract ""templates""? I know three or so years ago if you wanted to build anything on Ethereum using smart contracts you needed to create and code your own contract from scratch. These days are gone and I'm sure I can get a template that would suit my requirements, change some things and build what I need.  \nI need to create an MVP, so this doesn't need to be a fully polished project.

Since the value of USD is fairly stable and reliable (I know there's still risk of inflation and stuff... let's just assume that it will continue to be a solid currency for most uses), I could imagine a future where mainstream adoption occurs but almost everyone just holds and transacts in USD stablecoins, instead of ETH.\n\nWhat incentives are there to use base ETH over stablecoins for most applications? And is there anything stopping the ethereum economy from just becoming a back-end foundational infrastructure on which a much large stablecoin economy runs?\n\nWould stablecoin dominance stall ETH price? Would it disrupt any other aspects of the market? Would it disrupt the vision of ethereum?\n\nThanks for you comments!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kbt23r/effects_of_potential_stablecoin_dominance_for/,1,6
