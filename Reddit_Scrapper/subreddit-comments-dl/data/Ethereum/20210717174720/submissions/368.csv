I personally don't think she has a strong grasp of the layers of the ETH ecco systems are...  but that aside, there is a topic about EIP 1559 in which even Lyn Alden feels EIP 1559 would be one of the *most* beneficial elements implemented in ETH.\n\nComing from someone (Lyn) who is hesitant about ETH's future and at the same time saying it's the most promising aspect of ETH this year, one must question why there are people who don't want EIP implemented.  It's a very small groups but ETH is open to listen to what they have to say at the end of Feb. anyhow...\n\nLet's also consider there are 100's of millions being staked by investors that knew staking and EIP 1559 would be implemented.  Stakers are locked in.  We can't remove ourselves from the network. Minors can anytime they want.  This is a factor that miners don't seem to appreciate...  Miners can come and go validators and stakers have a one way ticket...  That's called conviction and should be considered when implementing EIP 1559.  This is why we invested in the project to begin with...  Both have profit motives but only one is taking on the risk and that matters!\n\nSo in the end, it appears even those who (Lyn) are lukewarm about ETH feel EIP 1559 needs to be implemented.  These  are some of the most respected macro and financial advisors in crypto to date.\n\nRaoul Pal is amazing and has an excellent perspective on the ETH and I attribute this to his experience due to macro investing for decades.  Experience matters.\n\n""I can walk 20 paces and go across my office.  Linear paces.
