FYI - I am new to crypto and this is my first time attempting to transfer ETH..I had no problems transferring my BTC. I went to the beta wallet, changed crypto type to Ethereum and got the receive address via QR code but when I try to scan the QR on the Trezor device with the Coinbase app on my phone the app says the QR is not a Ethereum.
