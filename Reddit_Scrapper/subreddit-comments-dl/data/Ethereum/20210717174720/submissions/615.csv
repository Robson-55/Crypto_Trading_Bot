n637kx,1620292717,[Question] IDE for Smart Contract Development,"Hi I'm currently learning to develop and test smart contracts with the truffle framework and as I am familiar with Intellij and some sources suggested it I decided to also use it for solidity. Also I dint want to move outside of the jetbrains universe since I really like it.\n\nBut then I thought wouldn't it make more sense to use Webstorm? I never really used it much but it is an IDE for JavaScript development and with truffle there is a considerable amount of js configuration to do. \n\nItellij is working fine but as I come from java development with gradle I am kinda used to all those cool and intelligent features, like a proper auto-completion and suggestions. It is working fine the way it is but I thought maybe it can be done better. \n\nAny tips or experience you want to share with me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n637kx/question_ide_for_smart_contract_development/,1,4

n63t65,1620295326,Freewallet KYC Scam," Hi guys,\n\nFreewallet has been locking my account for over four months, I just wanted to share my experience with them. I hope this can contribute to warning people not to get involved with their services. If my issues would somehow get resolved, I will provide an update.\n\nThey delete all my posts on their subreddit (for no valid reason, I am polite and completely honest), so I decided to warn people here as well.\n\n29/01: ""suspicous"" activity (me attempting a withdrawal)\n\nWe’d like to inform you that our security system has detected **suspicious activity on your account**. In case it was a hacking attempt, we had to **temporarily suspend withdrawals** from your account – this way your funds will be absolutely **safe**, and the access will be restored **once the verification procedure will be finished**.\n\n02/02: After some confusion, they ask for these documents\n\nTo proceed with the verification procedure, we ask you to provide the following information:\n\n1. A clear photo of **yourself** with your **identification document** in English and a **paper** where you hand-write our brand name ‘Freewallet’, the current date and the email address you used to verify your account notifications.\n2. A clear photo of your identification document in English: an international ID or a driver’s license (both sides). Scanned and cropped images are not accepted.\n\nBetween 02/02 and 16/02, they request various variations on this theme. The same pictures, but different.\n\n16/06: More documents\n\n**1)** Screenshots of your **incoming transactions** where we can see **hash**, **amount** and the **name** of the sending service (another wallet, exchange and so on);\n\n**2)** Bank statement or utility bill where we can see your name and resident address. Information should be **in English;**\n\n**3)** A **photo of yourself** in front of the image **“Attention”** (attached below) on your computer monitor (if you use a web version of **Freewallet**) or near your mobile device with the **app open** so that we were able to see your **user ID**.\n\n16/02 - 01/04: Apologies and standard answers\n\nPlease accept our apologies for the increased waiting time.\n\nCurrently, your case is still under review by our security department. \n\nWe will update you once we get new information.\n\nWe absolutely understand the difficulties associated with this procedure for you and would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused.\n\n02/04: an ""investigation""\n\nAt the moment, an investigation is underway regarding one of the addresses from which you received funds. The Security Department is waiting for the investigation to complete.\n\nNote that I have never received any funds, I purchased everything myself and have proven this.\n\nBetween 02/04 and today they have stopped replying, only rarely just sending out the same standard answer.\n\nI will continue to post about this until I get a decent answer, and I hope people stay far away from this platform.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n63t65/freewallet_kyc_scam/,1,20

n63tbe,1620295343,[Question] 8x 3090 vs 10x A5000,"guys, I need some hard truths here --- I'm buying a batch of gpus to solely mine with. I currently have two offers, either 8x RTX 3090 from Inno3D, or 10x RTX A5000 from PNY. both batches will put me at 960 MH/s and cost the same. what I'm considering is, one option is a 3090, gaming-oriented, from a brand I don't really know of as high quality, and another, the A5000, is catering to the professional sector, and that leads me to believe it's built to last longer and built under stricter quality control, however I've never heard of PNY before, because I was never in the market for Quadros, but only ever dealt with GeForce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. am I even correct with thinking the PNY A5000 is better built than the Inno3D 3090 and will last longer? I've been told that gaming-oriented cards put to mining tend to degrade in performance after 1-2 years, and may have vram issues, etc., whereas the Quadros are built to last\n2. after optimization, the A5000 draws less power (180w vs 3090's 285w), and even if I get two extra A5000 to match the 3090's hashrate, it still comes out 300-400w lower for the whole rig, HOWEVER, I currently run with just one 2080 ti, which is supposed to do 57 MH/s on Ethash at 180w, but I'm getting 70 and even 80 MH/s at the 180w, and so I'm wondering maybe the advertised 120 MH/s for the 3090 is the same case? maybe I'll hit 130 and 140 with it? on that same note, the A5000 (or Quadros in general) cannot be overclocked at all, and I've read that they're fairly sensitive to thermal fluctuations, whereas the gaming cards are more lenient with that sort of thing\n3. finally, there's the matter of being to sell the cards if shit hits the fan. it'll probably be a lot easier for me to find a buyer for a 3090 than it will for an A5000, however, if that point comes a year or two down the line, will the 3090 even be in a condition to be resold? or will they've turned to mush by then?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHELP!
