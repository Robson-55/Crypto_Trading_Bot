I can either make a small profit now and sell out or wait and try to turn a larger profit.  \n\nI keep reading all these articles about etherium being dead in the water and cardano, and polka dot replacing it in the near future.

ltiesl,1614408619,Ethereum Vs Competitors,"Hi all,\n\nI've been a Bitcoin maximalist for years now and have started warming up to Ethereum. I have a small amount of Ethereum (about 4% of my Crypto at the moment) and would love some opinions on Ethereum Vs. the so called 'competitors' like ADA, DOT, BNB, whatever else is the ""next ETH"". So far, my gut feel is that all these alt coins are trying to copy ETH's main goal (kind of like how a bunch of alt coins tried to copy Bitcoin in the last bull market).\n\nI understand I might get some biased results on this subreddit, but I would love some opinions, links, articles, information, or really anything that I can look into as to why Ethereum is the go to for its purpose. I am currently considering whether to move a larger amount of my Bitcoin into Ethereum, with the hopes of running my own validator one day, and would love as much info as possible.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the posts so far! It's all useful info to me, regardless of whether I may directly agree with the statements or not. I will take it all into consideration as I do more research into Ethereum!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ltiesl/ethereum_vs_competitors/,49,96
