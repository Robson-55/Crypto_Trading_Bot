n7spqs,1620490952,Ether Fund vs Ether?,"I am in Canada and invest in Ether using Wealthsimple.  In Canada, we have what's called a tax free savings account, tax free investment vehicle up to a certain amount.  There's an ETF on Wealthsimple called The Ether Fund (TEF).  I've also put money in to that, but a lot less.  I thought TEF would track Ether's growth, but it doesn't.  For example over the last month, the Ether Fund has grown 56% while Ether has grown 75%. At that rate I might as well pay the tax on Ether!  Does anyone know the reason for this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n7spqs/ether_fund_vs_ether/,1,6
