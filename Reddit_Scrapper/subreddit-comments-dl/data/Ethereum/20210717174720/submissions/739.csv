The call will be recorded and posted on [VitaDAO's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/vitadao). If any of your questions will not be answered due to time limitation - we will answer them on Discord after the call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you don't know what** [**VitaDAO**](https://www.vitadao.com/) **is:** it's a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) coming together to fund and support the researchers and labs doing longevity science. Funding agreements will include ownership of IP (patents and research data) so we can monetize it (benefiting the researchers and allowing us to fund further research).\n\nGoals of the organization:\n\n* Fund promising research\n* Make Longevity Science Intellectual Property and Data available on an open market\n* Involve patients and researchers (and YOU!) in funding decisions through a DAO\n* Build IP portfolio and monetize it\n\n[VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/), in other words, wants to do the opposite of the current system, which sees longevity science research receive meager public funding, *maybe* result in a startup, and then get gobbled up by big pharma where the science is closed, patent protected, and profit driven. This system results in overpriced drugs based on dubious, unrepeatable science that downplays negative results in favor of profits. Another problem with the existing system is unprofitable existing drugs and treatments are ignored entirely, even if they have promise.\n\nCome see what VitaDAO is doing!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nq6hct/vitadao_community_call_dao_focused_on_early_stage/,1,0

nqbcvi,1622601588,Will Ethereum need iExec to Scale?,"Ethereums current state struggles when performing rigorous computations efficiently and at reasonable cost.\n\nToday, this isn’t really an issue because most dApps (Decentralized Applications) don’t have a working product. The dApps only utilize Ethereum for their ICO sale and for simple transactions with their tokens — Ethereum is well suited for that. But once all these dApps start releasing actual products, with actual computational demands, Ethereum not only will not be able to keep up, but it will become prohibitively expensive. Since Ethereum charges ether (gas) to run the network, intensive computations would cost a fortune. Imagine when Ethereum’s computational demands increase by 10x, or 100x: the network will be unusable.\n\nTLDR: Ethereum is great for simple computational processes like transactions. But the dApps on Ethereum need to do more. They need more power than the Ethereum virtual machine can provide.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe solution to this is offchain computing. dApps need to be able to do their heavy computing offchain (meaning not on the Ethereum blockchain) and then bring the information and results back onto the Ethereum blockchain for verification. iExec enables just this. dApps can use iExec’s decentralized cloud computing services to safely, simply, and cheaply, execute their computation far from the inefficient and incapable Ethereum VM.\n\nAccording to iExecs whitepaper they can make this system possible on a global scale. Including support for Fault Tolerance, multi-applications, multi-users, public/private infrastructure, deployment of virtual images data, data management, security and accountability, etc.\n\nExample of dApps:\n\nFlixxo - is a dApp that envisions itself as the decentralized YouTube. Because of all the encoding and decoding of videos on the blockchain, it requires an enormous amount of computer power. “iExec will allow the platform to do [this] by providing cloud resources,”\n\nRequest - is another partner. Request plans to offer automated auditing of financial records. This is also an extremely intensive computational process. iExec again provides the offchain solution for this computation — the results of the audit can then be easily transferred to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nUsers and businesses will also be able to utilize the iExec services for their own projects and uses. Need more power for your fantasy football algorithms? iExec can do that. Want to play Fifa with 4k settings? iExec is your tool.\n\n\nFor those out there. Cloud computing in general is a must have market. Google, IBM, Microsoft all provide cloud computing so companies that need access to processing power without having to maintain expensive technological infrastructures themselves. Companies like Netflix, Apple and Etzy all manage in cloud computing with these companies",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nqbcvi/will_ethereum_need_iexec_to_scale/,1,4
