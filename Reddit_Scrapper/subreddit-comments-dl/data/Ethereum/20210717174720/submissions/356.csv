I have deployed one or two for fun, but overall my understanding of solidity is limited.\n\nMy main question is randomness. Given that smart contracts are deterministic, I take it that randomness is not possible without an oracle?\n\nWould it be possible to delay execution until x blocks have passed, and use that future blockhash as part of a seed?\n\nCould anyone recommend some resources for me to learn more about this, or about smart contract programming in general?

lbuvw8,1612378084,Questions regarding transfers between Trezor Wallet and Coinbase,"I initiated an ETH transfer yesterday afternoon from my Trezor Wallet to my ETH wallet in Coinbase. I used the lowest gas price, and the transaction still hasn't been confirmed and cleared. I am guessing due to all the transactions that are happening, a low gas price was probably not the best idea.\n\n* Can I cancel my transaction and use a higher gas price to expedite the transfer to my Coinbase?\n* If I wait, will it eventually transfer?\n* Theoretical question: Let's say I have 2 ETH in my Trezor wallet, and I initiated a transfer of 1 ETH that is still pending. While the 1 ETH transaction is unconfirmed, I still technically have 2 ETH in my wallet. If I transfer the 2 ETH with a higher gas price, what will happen?\n\nEDIT: I initiated a new transfer with a higher gas price, and the older one got ""canceled"". Problem solved.
