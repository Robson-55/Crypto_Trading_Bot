nmj8cx,1622154038,I don't understand how the gas fees work,"I am trying to transfer some of my cryptocurrency (ex. USDC) into another wallet/marketplace. I believe when I transferred from CoinBase to another wallet, CoinBase themselves paid the gas fees since I don't have ETH in my CoinBase account. The only weird thing is that the amount I transferred wasn't the entire amount and paid a network fee to CoinBase? So, if I ""had"" ETH in my CoinBase then I could pay for the gas fee myself, wouldn't it have been better for me to done the transfer using my own funds? I am assuming this how things operate in CoinBase (a fee from themselves?) or maybe someone could clarify this part for me. Perhaps I do not understand the difference between network fees and gas fees? Or are there more fees that I need to know of?   \n\n\nThere are some questions I have about the gas fees and how they work. First, I am using sites such as [gasnow.org](https://gasnow.org), [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io), and [ethgasstation.info](https://ethgasstation.info/). When using these sites and trying to figure out the ""best"" pricing to choose from, I wonder if it's reliable on setting these custom prices compared to using whatever the wallet/marketplace price gives you. The next thing I am confused about is the Gas Limit part. Gas Limit 21,000 seems to be the minimum amount. I am not sure if I should use this amount since I've read that it's only for simple transactions though I don't know what a ""simple transaction"" is. When transferring a stablecoin such as USDC, is that considered a ""simple transaction"" or would it fall under a ""smart contract""? If so, how do I differentiate transactions that are ""simple"" and using ""smart contracts""? I believe transactions using smart contracts require more fees, thus using the minimum Gas Limit may not succeed. So, how does one determine what Gas Limit to use since I read that using too little would be rejected and using too much would be a waste but you might get refunded for the extra portion of Gas not used? I see that [gasnow.org](https://gasnow.org) lists the amount of ""gas used"" under the transaction costs though it brings me back to the same question on how reliable it is to custom set the Gas Limit.  \n\n\nIf there are additional resources/better tools to use for these gas fees transactions, it'll be nice to know. These are the current ones I've stumbled upon and I don't mean to be doubtful/bashful on these platforms that are providing good data. I am just a newbie in the crypto space living in the shittest state that doesn't want to deal with crypto making certain exchanges/platforms unaccessible. I am trying to read more before making any big moves/transactions so that I don't get screwed with mismanaging my wallets. Thanks for taking the time to deal with my nonsense.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nmj8cx/i_dont_understand_how_the_gas_fees_work/,1,12

nmjq5a,1622155560,My Retiring Father's Crypto Concerns," I'm having a discussion with my father(62) who is approaching retirement age about using crypto as a way to diversify his investments. He will have a comfortable retirement regardless of adopting cryptocurrency; but I'd like to turn him around on his stance. He understands the store of wealth concept; but doesn't think crypto works as a currency. His takes:\n\n1. Takes notice of high transaction fees compared to standard credit\n2. And experiences FUD regarding the federal government not adopting/outright banning crypto. Obviously no entity can ""take down"" crypto; but I kind of see his point that sanctions from the US government would limit its practical applications and/or value.\n\nBackground: He is a tech guy, and has always been a proponent of innovation and moving things forward while also being a highly skeptical person who hails from a small-farm in a very rural area. He helped introduce GPS precision mapping to farming in the 90's. Builds his own planes, invested in the internet pre and post bubble. Forward-thinking guy all around; but gives no time to bullshit or pipedreams. Not a dreamer if you will, very much a pragmatic realist.\n\nWhat can I tell him regarding those two points? I really would like to win him over with some honest talking points. And honestly, I'm interested in learning more about those issues myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nmjq5a/my_retiring_fathers_crypto_concerns/,1,23
