k45juj,1606771259,"Why providing liquidity to Uniswap today is inefficient, and how we can make it more efficient"," Today, the liquidity providing market is full of inefficiencies, mainly:\n\n* Impermanent loss is a big risk for liquidity providers. Many prefer to avoid that risk by earning lower yields in safer ways.\n* When providing liquidity to a pair, the liquidity provider must provide the tokens in the exact ratio. For example, on Uniswap each pair is made of two tokens. The liquidity provider must provide 50% of the value with the first token and 50% with the second.\n* LP tokens are not accepted as collateral by almost any lending market, even if they are backed by tokens that are usually accepted as collateral.\n\nThese are some of the reason that discourage potential liquidity providers to contribute to AMMs, and therefore the reason why, now, the liquidity providing market is suboptimal.\n\n## A lending market designed for LP tokens\n\nWe (Impermax Finance) are building a lending market where borrowers can use the LP token of a pair as the collateral to borrow the assets that make up that pair. For instance, the LP token of the pair ETH/DAI can be used as collateral to borrow ETH and DAI..\n\nWe will be using an innovative collateralization model specifically designed for LP tokens that will take advantage of the fact that the collateral is backed directly by the assets borrowed. LP tokens holders will be able to leverage their investment and even multiply their yield by several factors.\n\nThe first AMM that we will add is Uniswap, and in particular we will support all the pairs supported by Uniswap V2. Read more about [the mechanics of our lending market](https://impermax.finance/a-lending-market-designed-for-the-lp-tokens-of-uniswap-and-other-amms/).\n\n## Making liquidity providing more efficient\n\nThis kind of lending market will create a lot of new possibilities for liquidity providers. They will act as lenders or borrowers.\n\n* Lender will be able to indirectly provide liquidity to the AMM, so earn a yield on any token supported by the AMM without any exposure to impermanent loss. Also, they won’t need any specific ratio of tokens to start investing but can provide as liquidity any number of tokens they prefer.\n* Borrowers will be able to use all their LP tokens as collateral, and so use them to borrow assets and to buy more LP tokens, thus leveraging their yield. They will still be exposed to impermanent loss, but as Peter Ducker said: “All profit is derived from risks”.\n\nWe’re giving liquidity providers the tools to adjust their risks by acting as either lenders or borrowers. We think that lending will attract more investors to the liquidity providing world as the risk introduced by the impermanent loss is removed. At the same time, we’re also giving the possibility to leverage a certain LP token when it may be undervalued. This will make the liquidity providing market a lot more efficient.\n\n \n\nRead on the website: [https://impermax.finance/the-inefficiencies-of-the-liquidity-providing-market-on-uniswap-and-other-amms/](https://impermax.finance/the-inefficiencies-of-the-liquidity-providing-market-on-uniswap-and-other-amms/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/k45juj/why_providing_liquidity_to_uniswap_today_is/,1,1

k48teo,1606780870,"Yesterday I asked Reddit to explain the 2.0 update, so I figured I'd try making a video explaining it!","I hope no one minds, but I know I sometimes like to listen to things instead of reading it. I will also post a TL;DW incase anyone is curious as I am. If a mod wants to remove this, no biggies! If you guys watch, I'd love some feedback on this as well, as I'm not usually too good at these types of videos!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9xY2ysEV5E&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9xY2ysEV5E&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\n(beware, annoying crypto shilling when I'm explaining eth. Just skip that haha.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you guys don't want to watch and are curious, my thoughts or major points everyone seemed to note was:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSwitching to POS instead of mining which is the biggest change overall. Which means you earn eth from staking and validating the network instead of mining it. Which also with this upgrade it improves the speed, scabability, and I believe safety of the network. It also has the perk of it being better for the enviornment and allowing different types of dapps to be developed in the future. Also I believe lower gas fees on the network as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStaking is able to be done with helping validate the network with the 32 ethereum, but coinbase and I'm sure other pools will be adding pooling options to earn interest on your ethereum. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso eth 2.0 is not technically taking over eth as of now, but moreso it is STARTING the building process and building towards it, which is why there was a very big incentive for early hosters to start building and moving the network over. \n\nIf anyone can offer more of an explaination, as in the video I was iffy on how the full on process moving over to eth 2.0 will go. From what I read it seemed like it's not fully going to transfer over yet, and is still to be determind, but I was reading where it could be the entire networked moved on in transaction, and also hearing how it'd be mimicing the ETH chain for awhile and then eventually moving on over. That was the one part even in the video I'd like more clarifcation on!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, let me know if you guys liked the video or this very quick rough type up, and if anyone wants to elaborate more for folks I'd love to hear it! Thanks for reading, and I hope no one hates me for the video post! \n\n  \nSpecial thank you to  cryptocraze\_0/ Etan 1 and iamtomorrowman and i\_thank\_you  who had some very easy to explain comments on my reddit thread, and everyone who commented on the thread yesterday who encouraged me to do more research on my own!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/k48teo/yesterday_i_asked_reddit_to_explain_the_20_update/,1,0
