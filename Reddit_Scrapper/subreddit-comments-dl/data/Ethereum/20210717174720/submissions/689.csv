nfs0i9,1621387146,Need Help with Uniswap v3,"Hello Ethereans, I'm adept in DeFi and successfully migrated my Balancer pools to V2. However, I'm struggling with the Uniswap because I'm not a trader. I understand the liquidity concentration V3 is doing and I followed their guide on how to migrate, but I'm stuck on the part where I select minimum and maximum range for my liquidity. \n\nThe example in the docs is easy because it's ETH / DAI so the pricing is in a stablecoin. All my pools are separate digital assets so it's not priced in a stablecoin. Can someone walk me through how I determine the range of my liquidity? \n\nFor example, let's use wBTC / ETH. I know ETH is currently at .07 BTC. I'm a conservative LP so I don't want to be constantly updating my range. I'm comfortable with a .03 - .2 wBTC range for ETH. I only want to update the liquidity range every 6 months or a year. However, every time I was messing with the numbers to migrate it kept saying my liquidity was off and I'd get liquidity returned to me. \n\nI also have other LP tokens with non-stablecoin assets in the Ethereum ecosystem so my preference is to understand how I come up with the range so I can do this on my own in the future. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nfs0i9/need_help_with_uniswap_v3/,1,1
nfs3r9,1621387390,Decentralized Social Media,"I am new to the world of decentralization and cryptocurrency. I have limited understanding of it, but it seems to have massive potential. It seems to be something that could revolutionize the digital world, especially on a network like Ethereum. Do you think that social media will eventually be decentralized? Will the information we post not be used to sell advertising dollars? Could we create post on this media as an NFT to sell to others? Is there potential for social media on Ethereum? Are there any sources you have read about this?\n\nThank you for reading this and I look forward to your insight!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nfs3r9/decentralized_social_media/,1,22
