jcacoo,1602856950,Question on how calldata works in the EVM.,"So I see that a lot of rollup solutions say that they store the chain's transaction data on Ethereum via ""calldata"" which is way cheaper in gas costs than contract storage (I understand this is due to the ever expanding State trie). Looking up how calldata works, it seems it is read-only memory slot for function arguments. But if it is memory that means it is non-persistent after the the function has completed thus the data wouldn't be available for users to rebuild the chain if necessary. \n\nDo users: just find the data from the the transaction trie (which would have every function argument stored in it), or is there some way to make calldata persistent, orrr do they transfer the calldata to storage after it is run (this seems to defeat the purpose as it would still be very expensive and result in state bloat) orrrrr I have fundamental misunderstanding of calldata.   \n\n\nJust trying to solidify my understanding of the EVM.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jcacoo/question_on_how_calldata_works_in_the_evm/,1,1
