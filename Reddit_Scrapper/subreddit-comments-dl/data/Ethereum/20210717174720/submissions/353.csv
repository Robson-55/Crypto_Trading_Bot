lbfjf2,1612326558,Michael Saylor does not understand what Ethereum is and what ETH 2.0 will for it.,"Michael Saylor‚Äôs statement about how Ethereum is trying to be a flying shark is clear evidence he does not understand what it is. Ethereum is not trying to be a shark, or a bird, or any other concrete immutable thing for that matter. Ethereum is a shapeshifter. It is the shark hunting for prey in the deep ocean, and the eagle ruling the skies. Ethereum is many things at the same time - it was designed to be this way. It is a value agnostic network just like the internet is a data agnostic network. Michael also suggested that ETH 2.0 is a ‚Äútotally different beast‚Äù, and that he would have to wait for that to come out to have an opinion about it. Again, this is evidence that he does not understand Ethereum and what the 2.0 upgrade is all about. Ethereum 2.0 is a continuation of technical improvements that will allow for the value proposition of Ethereum to be fully realized. The planned changes and their respective cryptoeconomic impact have been extensively discussed by the community. Anyone who has looked at the information should be able to understand its value and anticipate results before it is fully implemented.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lbfjf2/michael_saylor_does_not_understand_what_ethereum/,8,45

Running AI on the EVM sounds like it shouldn‚Äôt be possible (especially right now) but perhaps in the future it would be with established use cases. Does any know why this wouldn‚Äôt be possible?\n\nAlso, as Elon‚Äôs Neuralink company advances, maybe it might one day become possible for humans to interface with blockchains directly. \n\nAnd finally, when we inevitably invent a generalised AI, what effect this might have on decentralised networks too.  \n\nTldr- A.I Blockchains",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lbfzvp/would_it_be_possible/,0,0
