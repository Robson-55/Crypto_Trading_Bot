loesdx,1613849720,Some thoughts on the networked state,"I acknowledge that this isn‚Äôt the usual type of stuff that gets posted on the sub but I thought I‚Äôd share my interpretation of the network state. I think having this 5000 ft view helps in understanding where crypto is going and why it has emerged. \n\nIf you don‚Äôt feel like reading something that is a bit out there, please feel free to skip. I could be entirely wrong, and I would love to hear more discussion on this topic. \n\nTLDR: the first world is now a lateral state that overlays all physical states. Crypto and other technology are the pioneering infrastructure of that new state. \n\n\n\n\nWhat I‚Äôm going to outline relies on an understanding of the Pareto Principle. It states that in any system, 20% of the parts are responsible for 80% of the outcome. In other words, there are always going to be some people that are more productive than others. This does not mean that the less productive are any less deserving of resources. That is a separate argument and those two ideas shouldn‚Äôt be conflated. The Pareto Principle simply suggests that there are always going to be large inequalities of output by the constituent parts in a system.\n\nPhysical labor stops a more complete global Pareto distribution from emerging because the necessity of location allows those who are less productive to be in ‚Äúunnaturally‚Äù advantageous positions. Resources get locked in a physical location and are unable to find their most effective positions within the global configuration. The shift from physical labor to digital labor changes this by rotating the axis in which inequality sits by 90 degrees. Instead of inter-nation inequality caused by the effects of physical capital, we are shifting to absolute equality between nations and high intra-nation inequality. The intra-nation equality in the post-war US was an aberration. It wasn‚Äôt that the US had figured out a better way of architecting policy. It was simply that the US happened to be the most efficient place for the physical labor network to coalesce, drawing resources away from the rest of the world. While physical labor is dominant, the network effects generated by a previous generations are nearly impossible to break. The most productive members of the world need to be around each other when labor is physical. Everyone adjacent to this group benefits tremendously.\n\nWhen the axis in which inequality sits rotates 90 degrees, your physical location is mostly irrelevant. A connective tissue emerges between the most productive groups in each physical country. The internet is the new America. It adopts the meritocracy of America and cements it in a system that is not fettered by the unnecessary participants that were introduced by physicality. It is a stronger meritocratic sorting mechanism because it is liquid. It is easy to bring someone in but also easy to expel. The person performing physical labor during the pandemic, has been ‚Äúkicked out‚Äù of the new America. They can join tomorrow if they have the right skills or capital, however that doesn‚Äôt mean they can stay. The internet‚Äôs immigration policy is wide open, but it also immediately extradites if you can‚Äôt perform.\n\nIt should be simple to understand why it feels like western countries are degrading. The question that is often posed is ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we get our act together when we‚Äôre number one and have the most resources?‚Äù It baffles people. They see no other country doing better than us. They see no emerging threat. It‚Äôs because there actually is a new country. It is just emerging along an axis that we‚Äôre not accustomed to. It has the best people, it has the best laws, the most capital, the most growth, the best security policy. The United States is competing and losing to this new networked state, the internet. Western countries will continue to hurt themselves in confusion about where this threat is coming from. There is this vague sense from both the left and the right that there is something wrong with ‚Äúglobalism‚Äù. This is directionally correct but misses the true nature of the change because the shift is abstract in a way that most people struggle to see. It‚Äôs difficult to grasp that the nation is just a belief that we all hold and the strength of this fragile system is reliant on the importance of the protection of the physical labor network. The new networked state is the superpower. China, with a bit more foresight, recognizes this and has implemented various bans against the global internet. They understand that they are not competing against the United States, they are competing against the new world superpower. They need aggressive centralization to compete against the totalizing and dissolving power of the network. The Nature of the Firm hints at this dynamic by suggesting that firms will bifurcate and become simultaneously smaller and larger when the costs of location become less relevant. The state is a firm. The US is caught in the middle and will be outcompeted by both modalities.\n\nThis last election cycle has some striking similarities to how a stronger state would meddle in the affairs of a smaller, weaker country. The networked state is ‚Äúattempting‚Äù to degrade all institutions of the physical state while the citizens of the physical state rebel at how ineffectual their institutions seem at responding. This is not dissimilar to how banana republics in the past have been manipulated by the US. Every institution will continue to dissolve and degrade as more resources flee the physical state into the networked state. The institutions will be exposed as farces when people subconsciously understand that they are losing relevance and power. The aesthetics of the presidency and other legacy institutions enable them to maintain some legitimacy, but only for a limited amount of time, as the actual value and power underneath that signal have been hollowed out.\n\nThe first world is now a lateral layer that overlays all physical countries. Those that believed they were ‚Äúlucky‚Äù for being born in the US, or another rich country, were essentially saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thankful I‚Äôm near the physical labor network because I could not have competed against the most productive members of the world in another scenario‚Äù. The majority of these people are now going to see dramatically less advantages from being near those physical networks. The conditions for the lower classes in western countries will become the same as those in poorer countries, if not worse due to the direction of the change. This transition is going to feel primarily strange to those who have had the privileges of being in one of the ‚Äúgood‚Äù countries. Studies relating to the gini coefficient have found that inequality itself causes violence and societal upheaval regardless of absolute wealth. Unfortunately, relativity does matter. My rationalist self would ask if it is any more problematic for your physical neighbor to be destitute versus someone halfway across the world? I think it‚Äôs an important question to ask when your associations in the new networked state are more important than your associations by physical proximity. I would argue that anyone that is disturbed by the thought of their physical neighbours becoming poor should ask themselves why they were so comfortable with other countries being poor under the old system.\n\nThe internet citizens of first world countries and the non-internet citizens of third world countries will not see lives drastically altered. If the inter-nation equalization were to happen as I‚Äôve outlined, there are two groups that would be most affected. It is the non-internet citizens of first world countries and the internet citizens of third world countries that will see their lives most affected. Of course the first descending and the second ascending. I cannot emphasize enough how much one should not want to be a non-internet citizen of a first world country. The internet is to the US what the US was to the Soviet Union. The waves of technology phenomena (the internet, crypto, massive tech conglomerates, social networks, digital nomadism) in the last 20 years are the pioneering infrastructure of the new state. These structures will continue to form and provide more and more services that were traditionally provided by the old state. The new state is more free, more capitalistic, more meritocratic. The system wants to pull us in that direction to make capital more efficient, so it is no surprise that this new structure would emerge. It just had to break free of the constraints of physicality first. I would just recommend making sure that you know how to get to the new America.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/loesdx/some_thoughts_on_the_networked_state/,1,1
