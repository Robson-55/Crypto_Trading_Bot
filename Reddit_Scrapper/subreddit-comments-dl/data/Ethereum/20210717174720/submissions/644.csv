It creates it stable value just by smart contracts so regulating this kind of stable coin seems impossible for me.

n9hu68,1620685355,"TSLA Bull here - Thinking about selling most, if not all of it, for ETH.","Hi everyone,\n\nBig TSLA bull here. I bought several shares at the beginning of last year, and it's treated me well up until this year. Since my portfolio has been tanking in 2021 i've been looking into other places to put my money and I decided to finally give crypto a chance. I started a Coinbase account last week and sold half of my TSLA for ETH. \n\nI don't need to tell you all how that's doing lol it's nice to see some green again. I'm still a major TSLA bull but i'm tired of living in the red lately. And especially seeing that there wont be any major catalysts soon (at least, IMO, til Giga Berlin / Texas are up and running) I want to invest more in ETH.\n\nSo I guess my questions are, is it a decent idea to yet again dive in head-first to a single stock (er, crypto)  and hope that the gains soar? I have a very basic knowledge of Crypto and ETH but not nearly enough as I do in TSLA. I'm also wondering if any of you have sold all of your shares on the market and focused exclusively on Crypto.\n\nWhatever advice you got i'm all ears. If you know of a video or article I can read that really breaks down ETH, more so than what i've been finding, that'd also be amazing :) Thanks all!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n9hu68/tsla_bull_here_thinking_about_selling_most_if_not/,1,2

n9itp3,1620688123,Just Another Ethereum Scam (This is a long post),"Earlier this day, I opened my discord to find some room I could chat in. It had been a day after I had camped with a couple of lads. (A fine day, if I might add (   U   w U) I use UwU please don't berate me) My mind still mushed, I read one dm'ed messages, leaving one unopened and I continued my day.\n\nI continued talking to my friends about the experiences we've had, maybe talked a bit about other subjects (particularly trolling). Until I misclicked and clicked on that one unopened dm which made me internally scream ""noooo"", I wanted to keep that (for pride purposes.) In the chat read  [this](https://imgur.com/a/8E15WEq) , which I casually turned my head away at. I thought the guy was enticing me to join another discord server, which I was going to join in btw to have some fun. A couple of people had already added me.\n\nSo I haven't taken a bath at this point, the only breakfast I've had was cake and I haven't felt my sunburnt skin yet. I was curious, ready to see what he added me on, I opened my DMs. \n\nThere was a weird shift in my brain. I wanted to open a new server, but apparently it was money. I was a sceptic at first, until I read\n[It was from amazon](https://bitcocity.com/amazon-is-hosting-a-large-scale-draw-with-the-bitupporfolio-platform/). Amazon, is a billion dollar company, me and the scammers probably agreed on that with our separate need for attention. Notable keywords were $20,000,000 was given away by Amazon for the rising crypto currency value and they partnered with Bitupporfolio, a website created early 2017 tons of userbase, but apparently none of them are my connections. I wondered how legitimate that is, noticing the misspelled portfolio.\n\nIt was a promising website, with a sleek black/dark design. Really nice and easy on the eyes. I was ready to claim my prize.\n\nMind you, I haven't tried to open up the money yet, Eth to see if it was real.\n\nMy brain was still thinking of the camp we've had, unironically.\n\nWhat's weird was everytime I tried to search it, you had to pair it up with Amazon, or it just won't be found. Searching it also paired it with a bitcapmax wallet, [in this article](https://newspay.net/how-to-participate-in-the-ethereum-airdrop-giveaway-bitupporfolio/).\n\nIt should've been a red flag right now seeing all these articles but they've only been made a little over a few days ago. \n\nI redeemed the code. It was 8.73 eth. I didn't even know what that was about. Until I looked it up and it was a whopping 30k dollars, which would make me a millionaire. I've been chosen to just have some money.\n\nI popped open a wine bottle, and poured some over at a wine glass. But some parts of me thought it was too good to be true. I had discussed it with my friends. I told them I was rich first of all just to establish that sweet dominance. (God, I miss most of them.) \n\nSo I went in the website, didn't know how to transfer the funds yet, until I found myself [reddit post](https://np.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ldqet3/comment/gm7brzj?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=more_replies). It was basically a site explaining how the site bitcapmax was trying to screw them for .02 bitcoins so they could assume their validity and basically be verified. Bitcoin that size, mind you, is basically 800 American buckaroos. The guy was like what the heckies, I shan't pay to receive money.\n\nIt was promising.\n\nMy mind went back.\n\nThis is my money.\n\nI had told my friends I still had 0 idea how to withdraw it. My searches confirmed that there was just no way this site was popular. Reality was already weird, I told them that.\n\nThere wasn't even a single article addressing how to transfer money from that site to some more reliable site.\n\nSo I went ahead and [asked the support](http://imgur.com/gallery/hVTvB0x), and thence, it was gradually falling apart.\n\nBasically they wanted me to pay a small sum of .3 eth, which basically I just didn't have. I declined until they asked me it's ""your business"" seeing that from a support just turned on the meh factor inside me.\n\nI still have a lot of things to say but noticing that it's already a couple of paragraphs long, I just have this to say.\n\n[\nThe chat function is actually nice in their website\n](http://imgur.com/gallery/UqQWaUP)\n\nWho doesn't want to be enticed?\n\nWho doesn't want bigbux?\n\nRemember:\nScammers will try to entice you in every way. Make their websites flashy, appear good and promising in front of you.\n\nBesides, if you get scammed, the scammer will have to think about the moral implications of their issues.\n\nPlease choose to protect those around you or at least those who you believe are ideal.\n\nIf you're alone most of the time and encounter these, there isn't any shame in telling a bunch of people about it! Please take care.\n\n\nStay safe, wear a mask and smile infront of a screen.\n\nTl;Dr I almost got scammed. Unfortunately for them, I don't have money. Ha!

n9iul0,1620688196,Paying taxes on your gains (Germany),"Hi guys! I am very new, forgive me if the question is basic. If I keep all my gains from Ethereum and keep investing them and trading (never withdraw to my bank account) would that still be considered taxable?
