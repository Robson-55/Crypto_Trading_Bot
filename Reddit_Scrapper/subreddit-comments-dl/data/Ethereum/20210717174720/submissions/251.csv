ke2hxz,1608093823,Aavegotchi Sets Up Donations To Help Guy Who Lost His Life's Savings,"One very sad story did come to our attention this week. Dawid (\[@D13Kabani\]([https://twitter.com/D13Kabani](https://twitter.com/D13Kabani)) a father of two and Aavegotchi enthusiast staking GHST, made the type of mistake that every crypto user fears the most. He rushed a simple copy paste, mistakenly sending his entire LINK holdings (the great majority of his on-chain savings) to the GHST staking contract he‚Äôd previously interacted with instead of to the Binance deposit address he‚Äôd intended. \n\nWith crypto, there is no undo button and those LINK are irretrievably stuck in the non-upgradeable [GHST staking contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x93ea6ec350ace7473f7694d43dec2726a515e31a).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wj0aimvqah561.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f4cc1ac3b0ac1d44afdc5572459c278daa12c99\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/th4onz6sah561.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3199f7d5b2a7e0edd1b497ecfef06efd3adc0f9e\n\n \n\nMany of us have had our own learning experiences with crypto, and this can easily be shrugged off as another case of ‚Äúlesson learned.‚Äù BUT just because this situation is not amendable on a technical level, doesn‚Äôt mean we as a community, in the spirit of charity and goodwill, can‚Äôt do something kind for this poor chap.\n\nThat‚Äôs why we‚Äôve set up a SantaGotchi Wallet. On Christmas day we will be transferring whatever has been deposited in this wallet to Dawid, a father, GotchiGang member and Link Marine.\n\n&gt;***SantaGotchi.eth***\n\nAny little bit can help, let‚Äôs show our humanity this holiday season and try to help take the edge off for Dawid, even if just a bit.\n\nFrom Aavegotchi's most recent community update: [https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-community-update-17-dcc973821f3](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-community-update-17-dcc973821f3)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ke2hxz/aavegotchi_sets_up_donations_to_help_guy_who_lost/,1,49
