lbcedd,1612316470,Token Bonding Curves + Liquidity Providing + Std Governance Module = Decentralized and Democratic On-Chain Hedge Fund,"Hey there Ethereum Community!  \n\n\nI'm a cryptographer and Solidity developer and I love hacking around with DeFi and doing different smart contract projects in my spare time. I was inspired by all this commotion over the stonk market recently and it gave me some ideas that I tried to apply into some smart contracts. Basically when Chamath Palihapitiya tweeted:  \n\n\n\`\`\`r/wallstreetbets is now the largest hedge fund in the world.   Excepts it‚Äôs completely decentralized and entirely democratic.\`\`\`  \n\n\nI felt challenged to create the real thing: a truly decentralized and community managed Hedge Fund DAO on the ethereum blockchain. If you want to jump right to the code, you can check it out here: [https://github.com/superarius/pooled-compound-lp](https://github.com/superarius/pooled-compound-lp)  \n\n\nNone of the ideas here are original at all, it's really just taking a bunch of existing ideas and mashing them all together, and probably it's covering tracks that have already been covered. However I'm not sure that we've seen DeFi in exactly this flavor before so I want to present it to the community for some feedback:  \n\n\nTo cover the model I was going for really briefly:   \n\n\nToken Bonding Curves / Continuous Tokens: Everything centers around a Continuous Token bonded to a specified asset on some specified Bonding Curve. Basically anyone can mint and burn the Gov token, but the price is a direct function of the current circulating supply. If a lot of tokens have been minted when you send a transaction to mint tokens you'll get a smaller allocation of the Gov token for e.g. 1 DAI or e.g. 1 ETH than you would if you mint the token at some other time when the circulating supply is less. The price and supply are eternally fixed in this relationship and there is guaranteed liquidity from the Gov token into the collateral token, though the amount of collateral received and profit/loss made depends on how the supply differs from when you mint and when you burn the tokens. To put it simply the bonding curve makes it so that early money gets a discount. It also creates a primary market with automatic price discovery for the token and the collateral asset. Setting a ""Reserve Ratio"" or ""Connector Weight"" of 0 on the bonding curve essentially bonds the curve 1:1 with the collateral asset at a fixed price. (This could be a nice and fair model as well, i.e. if the collateral is a stablecoin every dollar invested gets the same participation in DAO governance and rewards as any other). Ok thats Token Bonding Curves, briefly.  \n\n\nLending to Compound: Here's where it gets a bit more interesting. In standard Token Bonding Curve the collateral just sits there in the contract (it is ""collateral"" after all). However in our case the (let's say DAI though it works just as well for any other Compound Finance asset) collateral is immediately lent to Compound and the contract holds cDai while tracking the amount of DAI collateral it has received from token holders. This way we can have the standard economics of a Token Bonding Curve but also generate interest. That interest could be divided among token holders or governed over arbitrarily by them. There is also COMP accruing just for providing liquidity which can also be governed over by the community. This is particularly interesting because you basically create like a ""Province"" inside the Compound Finance ""Country"" and that province has it's own process for deciding where it will allocate the COMP votes, something vaguely similar to the Electoral College. Finally there is the OPTION (though I showcase both ways) to allow Hedging Bets on the deposited collateral. Now this creates risks of losses and insolvency (like Melvin Capital is having :)) but also shows the potential possibilities of the idea. The community can control the Bonded Token contract (which is the contract actually lending all the collateral to compound) and could be permitted to do Borrowing off of the asset which is already being lent to Compound. In this way the community could in theory short and long different compound markets all through smart contracts and governance voting on proposals for price points to sell at and targets to hit etc. They could act as a full fledged crypto hedge fund.  \n\n\nGovernance Module: I basically just forked uniswap governance (which was already a fork of Compound's governance). By making the governance module the ""Owner"" of the Bonded Token contract you get the properties described above which makes it possible to collectively control the community position in the compound markets.  \n\n\nNow this is only a sketch and there are a number of possible concerns and potential flaws or security risks in the idea. And of course a number of parameters to tweak and play with (the shape of the curve, the quorums needed for governance actions etc. etc.). There's also the very important questions of privacy and speed which are both difficult to achieve with DAO governance and quite important when it comes to trading (it needs to be able to avoid gross manipulation since investment actions are publicly scheduled). And finally there are legal risks which I'm pretty interested in (or I would have already thrown something up on mainnet). I'm not trying to do anything illegal, but I'm also this isn't some scam, I'm hoping to start some community driven fully decentralized little experiment and see if it works or grows.
