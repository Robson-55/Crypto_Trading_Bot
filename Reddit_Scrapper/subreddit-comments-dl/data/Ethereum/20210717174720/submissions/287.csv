Matt Garnett will follow with a look at a few EIPs and ERCS to watch for in 2021.\n\nRegistration Link: [https://t.e2ma.net/click/bzkyod/jlr8o7c/n0x29p](https://t.e2ma.net/click/bzkyod/jlr8o7c/n0x29p)\n\n**The EIP Standardization and Network Upgrade Process &amp; The Top 5 EIPs and ERCs to Watch For in 2021**\n\n*Wednesday, January 13, 12:30 PM - 1:30 PM ET*\n\nPooja Ranjan, herder-in-chief of the Ethereum Cat Herders and founder of EtherWorld.co, will explain the history of EIPs, EIP categories, and the current process for writing and reviewing them before they go on to become a standard. She will also provide an overview of the latest changes and revisions to the network upgrade process, which has been recently separated from the EIP process.\n\nYou will also hear from Matt Garnett, a member of the Quilt research group, about which EIPs and ERCs to watch in 2021. There are several highly anticipated protocol changes expected in 2021.\n\n*About the Speakers*\n\n*Pooja Ranjan is the founder of* [*EtherWorld.co*](https://etherworld.co/) *and heads up the Ethereum Cat Herders, a group dedicated to project management and process improvement for Ethereum blockchain. She is passionate about blockchain and spends most of her time creating awareness, communicating development progress, and working towards sustainable growth of the Ethereum community.*\n\n*Matt Garnett is a member of the Quilt research group within ConsenSys Mesh and is an EIP Editor. His work focuses on understanding and improving the execution layer for Ethereum.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout EIPs and ERCs\n\nAn EIP is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community about a new feature for Ethereum, its processes, or its environment. The EIP is a concise technical specification of the feature and provides a rationale for its use. The EIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\n\nAn ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) is proposed for application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards (ERC20), name registries (ERC26, ERC137), URI schemes (ERC67), library/package formats (EIP82), wallet formats (EIP75, EIP85), and more. Historically, an ERC forms the original proposal and, with further input, is refined into something participants agree is useful and deserving of becoming an EIP.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kry1ik/free_talk_the_eip_standardization_and_network/,1,3
