l4298i,1611504772,PSA to Newbies coming into Ethereum and Bitcoin: Don’t buy from any exchange that doesn’t allow you to actually withdraw your coin,"##The Problem\n\nI’m seeing a big influx of new users asking questions about where to buy their first bitcoin or ethereum and how to store it. I didn’t realize this before, but mega corps such as PayPal, Robinhood, and Wealthsimple do not allow their users to actually withdraw their crypto to their own wallet. You only have the option to buy and sell the coin on their platform. This is terrible for the community and not at all what cryptocurrency is all about. These companies are basically creating gated communities where they are profiting from pure speculation, and is detrimental because if you buy on these platforms you will never have the ability to actually hold your own coins. You will end up in the same place which spurred satoshi tried to avoid which is having an entity or a government that can take away everything you own at any moment. They are also creating a system where they are taking your money to buy more BTC/ETH but they never have to sell their holdings. \n\n##So if you are new, where do you buy your BTC/ETH?\nThis question is going to be heavily dependent on what part of the world you are from. If you are about to post this type of question, please include which country you are from and what currency you want to buy in.\n\n##What wallet do I withdraw to?\nThe community consensus for long term holding is hardware wallets. The most popular ones are Ledger and Trezor which are both multi-coin wallets. ONLY ever buy directly from these websites, and never from resellers as they could potentially have been tampered with. If spending extra money is out of the question for you, then consider looking into generating a wallet with virtual machine that is not connected to the internet. I’m not as familiar with this method of wallet generation so I’ll let more informed people chime in on this. Alternatively, the least secure way out of the bunch would be to use an extension wallet like Metamask or MyEtherWallet. \n\n*Ledger have previous had a data breach where their customers information was leaked to the web. The hardware wallets themselves are still secure, but Google the circumstances of this to make your own informed decision on whether or not you want to continue using this wallet.*\n\n##I have questions, and I need help!\nWe understand that crypto is hard, and there are a barrage of information, traps, and scams out there on the internet, but it’s very difficult to help you when you don’t provide adequate information. You are much more likely to get support from the community if you are more specific with your question and provide as much details as possible *(never under any circumstance post your private key or 12/24 mnemonic key online while asking for help.)*",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l4298i/psa_to_newbies_coming_into_ethereum_and_bitcoin/,1,14
