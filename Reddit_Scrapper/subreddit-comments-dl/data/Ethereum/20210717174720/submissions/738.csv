npvlg2,1622558530,Staking ETH - running a node worth it?,"What is involved with running an staking node?  I know you need 32 ETH, but aside from that, how much of a pain is it to stake it yourself without joining a pool or going through an exchange? As someone who is semi-tech savvy, would there be a really steep learning curve?  I was planning on staking through Coinbase, but I really don't like the 25% that they take off the top. \n\nDon't have the 32 ETH yet, of course, but thinking it might be a nice goal to shoot for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/npvlg2/staking_eth_running_a_node_worth_it/,1,4

I do understand it‚Äôs a risky business, but I  believe there should be some ways to evaluate the artist or the artwork,  similar to how traditional art is evaluated.\n\nOf  course, it‚Äôs impossible to be 100% sure who will become the blue-chip  artist in the crypto world, but I‚Äôm thinking about building a small  portfolio by investing $10-15k in promising artists.\n\nIs  there any analytics like Artnet or Art Market monitor available for  NFTs? So far, I've checked out some works on the secondary market and it  seems that everyone is trying to just quickly make 10X, YOLO style.\n\nAnother question - does it make sense to buy NFTs now, amid the recent crypto price drop?\n\nCrypto enthusiasts, art market experts - any advice or opinion is welcome.¬†",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/npyaeq/best_strategy_to_invest_in_nft/,1,7

nq3r52,1622579354,Is it possible for me to recover these lost tokens? Please help!,"About two years ago I had around 500k Plian staked to a node on their network.  My computer started having a breakdown and I sent the private key to myself and factory reset the computer.  I then realized that this private key did not correspond to the address that had my tokens, and figured it must have been linked to a separate wallet (there were 3 distinct accounts in each wallet which provided different functions at that time).  I have recently been learning solidity and found out that these addresses could have been linked to one wallet.  Are these accounts randomly generated or could I generate two accounts on metamask and access the tokens?  I guess I'm asking whether there is a connection between these accounts that would be maintained even if I were to create new accounts for the address in metamask.  It will take a significant amount of effort to recover the key itself, so I am trying to figure this out beforehand.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks so much for reading and for your insight.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nq3r52/is_it_possible_for_me_to_recover_these_lost/,1,4
