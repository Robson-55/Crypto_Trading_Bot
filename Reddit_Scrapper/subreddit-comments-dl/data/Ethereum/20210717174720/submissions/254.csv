kf39cm,1608230273,I forgot in which wallet I was storing my ETH.,"Hey! I've been buying ETH regularly for the last 6 months. The other day I had to reset my pc completly, and before I did that I took all my recovery phrases and passwords with me. This morning I wanted to check my wallets, but... I forgot which one I had? I'm 90% sure it was either Trust Wallet or MetaMask, and if I use my recovery phrase it opens a wallet with 0 ETH. Is there any way to know what wallet I had? I usually buy on Coinbase and transfer the coins after.\n\nI know it sounds quite dumb, sorry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kf39cm/i_forgot_in_which_wallet_i_was_storing_my_eth/,2,4
