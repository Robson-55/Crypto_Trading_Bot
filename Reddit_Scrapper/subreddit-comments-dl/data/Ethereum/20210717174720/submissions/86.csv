House edge is around ~1% after player bonuses.\n\nThe super cool thing is that, like crash, you can invest in the house, become part of the bankroll, and collect dividends over time as the house wins money. As you play, you also earn ""tokens"", which are separate from your normal (and invested) balance and entitle you to daily dividends. There's also a weekly contest based off of your total amount wagered in the past week.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hyxqms/the_creators_of_ethercrash_have_released/,1,11

Also I wanted to know if there is any software with this capability out of the box, or if I must develope it from scratch.\n\nWhat I want to do is to download the latest 20K blocks to analyse the input-data of the trasactions within them to find patterns that would link to some readable data.\n\nDoes anybody know about this?
