lt8fic,1614375232,"Upgradeable smart contracts. Great idea or a betrayal of ""code is law""?","PREFACE:  This is not a developer question.  I'm looking for feedback from Eth **users** about how they actually feel about *upgradeable smart contracts*, especially if they don't trust them or dislike them at face value.  \nI'm an Eth developer (Solidity/Truffle) getting back into DApp creation after a long time away from Eth.  My first DApp was a game but it was intended for micro-transactions (i.e. - low entry fees to the game), and high gas fees made the game a non-starter.  \n\n\nI'm starting a new project and I'm agonizing over whether or not to use *Open Zeppelin's* library that supports *upgradeable* smart contracts.  These are smart contracts that are deployed in tandem with another smart contract that acts as a proxy to the underlying smart contract that does the actual work.  In other words, the public facing smart contract is simply a redirect to the worker smart contract, so that the worker smart contract can be changed at any time.  \n\n\nAs a developer I love this idea because what happens if I deploy a smart contract with some awful defect?  This happens even with smart contracts that have been audited by the best and brightest.  Also, what happens if I want to release a new smart contract with better features?  How do I get the Eth trapped in the original smart contract to the new one?  If I simply put in a function that would forward all the Eth the smart contract contains to some other given address, that's an opening for potential abuse because the contract owner can simply whisk the funds away at any time to some arbitrary address.  \n\n\n""Code is law"" is such an important principle to some that there's even a new coin out there where the devs ""destroyed"" all their admin private keys to the smart contracts that support the coin, in order to build trust in the platform.  Half the people loved the idea because it helps them trust the code because it can't be changed while the other half are now worried about what will happen if some major hack is discovered in the existing code, the kind of hack that led to a hard fork in the Eth network.  \n\n\nSo I'm asking you as someone who risks their now quite valuable Eth on a daily basis, how do you feel about upgradeable smart contracts?  Do you think they're a great way to provide better security against potential contract hacks and to provide new features as necessary to the contract users?  Or do you think they violate one of the most precious tenets of the Ethereum network, that of immutable code, because you feel strongly that ""code is law""?  Better asked, if you were looking to use a DApp and found out that the DApp uses upgradeable/proxy contracts, would you immediately turn your back on it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lt8fic/upgradeable_smart_contracts_great_idea_or_a/,5,13
lt8lbi,1614375701,The future of Ethereum and Dapps when the median consumer does not care about technology,"Reading about Ethereum, it is natural that the discussion revolves around the technology. However, the most exciting aspect of Ethereum is not the technology in itself but rather the ability it has to create value in our society. \n\nWith the premise that Ethereum’s success is dependent on the success of decentralized applications, dapps must succeed. Nevertheless, adopting such apps on a sufficient scale will not happen unless the end-user sees how such apps create value. Very few care about technology for the sake of technology; people care about why it can provide value by making their life easier or better. \n\nEthereum will benefit from more discussion around the use-cases of dapps, more importantly, from the general public's perspective. The fact is that the general public does not know what a blockchain, decentralized application, or a ledger is. Most do not have any relationship to cryptocurrency at all nor understand why something has to be decentralized. \n\nThe community around Ethereum has a significant influence on how the media and the public perceive the technology. Therefore, increasing the focus to potential use-cases of Ethereum and potential applications in the real world not only from a technical standpoint, will benefit all. \n\nOne could counter and say that Ethereum and the development of dapps are in such an early stage that such a discussion of potential use-cases at the level I am describing is pointless. Despite this, I would argue that such discussions are better sooner than later. Suppose we manage to focus not only on the technical side of Ethereum but also its use-cases; it will provide Ethereum with increased momentum, as more people will understand why they should bother to learn about this technology which again will have positive synergies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lt8lbi/the_future_of_ethereum_and_dapps_when_the_median/,9,15

lt8xgw,1614376651,High Gas Prices ⛽ Info &amp; Resources,"Hey there Ethereans! 👋 If you've tried to send a transaction in the last few months, you've probably noticed that gas prices have gone up quite a bit. For some (myself included!), sometimes it doesn't make sense to experiment onchain as much as I used to.\n\nI'll shed some light on the context here in this post:\n\n* Resource List\n* Why Gas Prices are High\n* Are other chains as good as they claim?\n* Other Initiatives\n* How you can help\n\n## Resource List\n\nBefore sending a transaction, try out some of the tips listed here to see the best times or fee depending on your urgency.\n\n* [What Is Gas?](https://support.mycrypto.com/general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/what-is-gas#:~:text=When%20you%20send%20tokens%2C%20interact,your%20transaction%20succeeds%20or%20fails.)) (MyCrypto)\n* [ethgas.watch](https://ethgas.watch/): aggregated gas price feed that checks multiple data sources\n* [Etherscan Gas Tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker): Gas Guzzlers, Gas Spenders, Historical Gas Oracle Prices\n* [GasNow.org](https://www.gasnow.org/): ETH gas price forecast system\n   * Gas price, pending transactions, historical gas price, average gas price, API\n* [ETH Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php): the original Ethereum gas estimator\n   * Top 25 Leaderboard, Tx calculator, tx pool vision, gas burners, API\n* [Gas Prices &amp; Trading Volume](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/gas-prices-trading-volume): Dune Analytics Dashboard\n\n## Why Gas Prices are High\n\nSimply put, Ethereum is getting more and more popular! Every day, we see new users starting projects in NFTs / digital art, DeFi, governance - all with passionate communities that want to use Ethereum mainnet. It's been amazing to watch the usecases grow over the past few years.\n\nAt the end of the day, this means competition between users. Gas prices are subject to their own markets of supply and demand. When there are a lot of users trying to send transactions, gas prices will increase to reflect that.\n\nThis is easy to see in times of high volatility. For example, with the recent drop in ETH price on Feb 23, gas spiked to over **1000 gwei** as people tried to move their DeFi positions and arbitrage bots cleaned up market imbalances.\n\nHaving a market for block inclusion (measured by gas prices) is important because blockspace is limited. This means that there's a cap to what can be included per block. [Here's a chart](https://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit) of the block gas limit over time. If there wasn't a limit to the size of blocks, then any sort of data could be put onchain for near 0 cost - this would break the chain.\n\nIn the near term, high gas prices may fluctuate, but over the long term, mainnet Ethereum may see sustained high gas prices when compared to previous years. Emerging Layer 2 solutions, which package many thousands of transactions to settle back to mainnet, will be able to pay a much higher gas price.\n\nIf you are interested in diving deeper, check out this report from 0x researcher Remco Bloemen: [Scaling DeFi — Layer One](https://blog.0xproject.com/scaling-defi-layer-one-7eeb24aca4f0)\n\n## What are L2s and which ones should you try?\n\nL2 stands for ""Layer 2"" - this is a big umbrella term for chain constructions linked to a base chain (Layer 1) in some way. While there's a wide range of designs, they all offload some of the demand from mainnet Ethereum while maintaining some or most of the security guarantees.\n\nWe're so excited about L2s because they will bring a new flavor of scaling before the merge with Eth2 is ready. Scaling means lower transaction fees! Here's a list of L2s that are live now or soon that you can try out. Remember, even though these protocols are promising, they are still early versions that will need to be battle hardened over time.\n\n* ZkRollups\n   * [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/) \- Exchange and Payment Protocol\n   * StarkEx - Starkware based Exchange that hosts [Deversifi](https://www.deversifi.com/) (Exchange), Immutable (NFTs), and [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/) (perpetual contracts)\n   * [zKSync](https://zksync.io/) \- scaling and privacy engine for Ethereum\n* Optimistic Rollups\n   * [Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.io/) (on testnet) - rollup built by [Offchain Labs](https://twitter.com/OffchainLabs)\n   * [Fuel](https://fuel.sh/) \- ""Fuel empowers any person on Earth with fast, secure, and cost efficient ERC-20 transfers and swaps using the world’s most efficient Optimistic Rollup""\n   * [Optimism](https://optimism.io/) (live in March) - Instant transactions and scalable smart contracts\n* Sidechains (Technically not L2, but they are often used for similar purposes)\n   * [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (fka [Matic](https://matic.network/)) - a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks\n   * [xDAI](https://www.xdaichain.com/) \- a stable payments blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive stable transactions\n\n## Are other chains as good as they claim?\n\nYou may also heard other chains claiming ""come to \_\_\_\_ chain, we've got  low / no fees!!""  While on the surface it may seem appealing, there's probably more being left unsaid. A few potential explanations:\n\n* They cut corners on decentralization - most frequently by increasing the hardware or bandwidth requirements for nodes. Ethereum takes this very seriously, and will only scale responsibly.\n* They are hiding the true costs - like requiring users to stake funds to send transactions\n* They will eventually run into the same issues as Ethereum - more users will inevitably lead to more congestion.\n\n## Other Initiatives\n\n* Near Term (weeks / months):\n   * [Turbogeth](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/) \- this is an experimental Ethereum client that rearchitected Geth to create a more performant client. Everyone should try to run a Turbogeth node to help them get ready for a full release! The strategies for state management TG is using, once present in other client implementations, may allow for a safe increase to the block gas limit while also maintaining the ability for consumer hardware to run nodes.\n* Medium term (\~4 months)\n   * Eip-1559 - Potentially being included in the London network upgrade in July, 1559 comes with a whole host of benefits\n      * more predictable tx inclusion (important for L2s like rollups)\n      * elastic blocksize\n      * reduce some MEV\n      * balance issuance w/ burn: a potentially steady cap asset that is still secure\n      * in protocol congestion oracle - (very important for L2s like rollups)\n* Long term (\~12 months)\n   * Eth2 - Proof of Stake, also called Serenity will also increase the total available blockspace through sharding. The Beacon Chain (the first piece of Eth2) is already live since December 2020, and the first hard fork is expected in mid-2021. The merge, projected for Q4 2021 / Q1 2022, will unite Eth1 and Eth2.\n\n## What you can do to help\n\nTo start, point people to this post - this info is only useful if it gets in front of people!\n\nComment your gas suggestions / hacks - I'll make sure to update the list at the top with the best ones.\n\nYou can also try out the L2 solutions as they go live, give feedback about the onboarding experience, and ask exchanges to support withdrawing directly to L2s. This will improve the experience for the existing community and everyone else coming soon.\n\nEthereum has an exciting future, and we're going to build it together!  🚀",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lt8xgw/high_gas_prices_info_resources/,94,100

This means when I switch wallets, the contents of the previous address remain visible. Only after refreshing the page does the new wallet contents load correctly. \n\n\nNo problem right? \n\n\nExcept today while using uniswap I somehow managed to get 2 addresses attempting the same transaction (I think). \n\n\nAddress A tried to perform a swap with uniswap. Transaction status in brave became stuck on pending. The link to etherscan from both brave and uniswap leads to ""Sorry, we are unable to locate this TxnHash"". \n\n\nInitially 106 gwei was used. The network appeared calm according to the gas tracker.\n \n\nI also checked the pending section of etherscan and could not find the transaction. \n\n\nI then realized the custom nonce number entered would have been the suggested value if address B were used. This is because Address A is brand new and currently recommends a 0 nonce value. \n\n\nSo I connect uniswap to address B to see if I can still make my swap while A is stuck. To my surprise a pending transaction is already in process. It has the exact values from the stuck transaction performed with address A. The etherscan link also leads to the same ""Sorry, we are unable to locate this TxnHash"" page. \n\n\nHowever, the brave wallet shows that address B has no transaction pending... \n\n\nI tried to cancel and speed up cancellation of the original transaction with address A. No success. \n\n\nDoes anyone have thoughts or suggestions? \n\n\nAlso, it would be nice if I didn't have to import custom tokens everytime I signed back into the wallet. Address names don't always save either. \n\nThanks\n\nUpdate : Cleared browser cache and reopened uniswap. Address B no longer has the pending transaction! Address A still stuck..\n\nUpdate 2: Tried a new swap with address B at 115 gwei. Again.. ""Sorry, we are unable to locate this TxnHash"" page.\nAnother stuck transaction...\n\nPerhaps it's because I am trying to wrap eth into weth?
