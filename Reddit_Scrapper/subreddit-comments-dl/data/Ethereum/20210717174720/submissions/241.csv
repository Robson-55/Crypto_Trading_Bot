k8pf38,1607374930,Blockchain Scalability and its Foundations in Distributed Systems,"VIPS, Blockchain promises to disrupt industries once it will be efficient at large scale. In this [Blockchain Scalability and its Foundations in Distributed Systems](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=gKVjjqRxqcQ&amp;offerid=759505.17780539874&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fblockchain-scalability) program  you will learn to make Blockchain scale.  You will learn about the foundational problem of distributed computing, Consensus, that is key to create blocks securely.Five skill-based training modules will help boost your career and technical skills, including: 1 - Consensus in Blockchain: Learn the basics on blockchain abstraction and the importance of consensus between machines in order to mitigate the risks of having an attacker spend the same asset twice - an undesirable situation called 'double-spending', 2 - Blockchain Fundamentals: Understand failures and delays blockchain systems must consider, and how these events may prevent machines from reaching Consensus., 3 - Consensus Fundamentals: Investigate how to solve consensus when failures cannot occur in the network. Later on, then learn how to solve consensus when processes may fail, first through crash failures and then when processes can behave arbitrarily, 4 - Making Blockchains Secure: Understand how delays in the network can impact the security of the Blockchain by using network attacks that allow hackers to steal digital assets in the past and that every Blockchain designer should be aware of., and 5 - Making Blockchains Scale: Design a scalable and secure Blockchain algorithm. What makes a Blockchain algorithm scalable and secure? This requires a consensus algorithm that works over the Internet and is not affected by unexpected communication delays. \n\nEnroll today (individuals or teams): [https://tinyurl.com/y55u](https://tinyurl.com/y55u5shu) \n\nMuch career success, Lawrence E.
