ndw08q,1621193717,Blockchain Gaming - The rise of the Metaverse economy on the Ethereum blockchain,"Metaverse is on the rise. The economic &amp; social implications of open, inclusive &amp; self-sovereign digital worlds are hard to overstate. For those reasons alone, metaverse is the future.\n\nBut thereâ€™s another story here. In fact, metaverse is not a luxury, itâ€™s a necessity\n\nOver the recent decades, the degree of freedom we have as individuals in the physical world has been declining. This includes freedom in a physical sense as overpopulation and urban migration make our cities less and less livable.\n\nIn 1950, only 2 cities had a population of more than 10m. By 2025-2030, an estimated 630 million people will live in ~40 megacities. This leads to inadequate infrastructure, slums, sanitation and healthcare problems. Among other things.\n\nOur degree of freedom is also restricted through rules and regulations. You probably noticed that there are more and more of those. Who wouldnâ€™t want to escape into the metaverse when you are increasingly told how to live your life in the real world.\n\nNow letâ€™s talk about the environment. Climate change is real. We are slowly destroying the world we live in. The Earth is becoming less and less habitable. At the same time, there are physical limits to our ability to avoid the consequences.\n\nOur efforts to address climate change have, so far, been inadequate. Vested interests, inability to sacrifice now for the benefit later, etc are some of the reasons. We donâ€™t know if we can fix this, but the signs are not good.\n\nSo, we are losing our freedom in the real world and, at the same time, the world is becoming harder to live in. This is why metaverse is the future. Unlimited degree of freedom. Unlimited space and possibilities. Plus better economic and social construct.\n\nSource 1:\nhttps://metaportal.substack.com/p/step-through-the-metaportal?r=9i6wt&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy\n\nSource 2:\nhttps://twitter.com/verto0912/status/1393838168928100356?s=21\n\nSource 3:\nhttps://twitter.com/crypto_texan/status/1392102133231726596?s=21",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ndw08q/blockchain_gaming_the_rise_of_the_metaverse/,1,0
