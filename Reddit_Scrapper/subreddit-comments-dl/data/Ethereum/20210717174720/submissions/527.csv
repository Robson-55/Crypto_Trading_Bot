mspdtb,1618660611,3 year old Ethereum ATM Ticket woes,"I bought some ether a while back in late 2017 from a SotashiPoint ATM in Manchester UK.  It gave me a lil' ticket with some QRs codes and keys on there.\n\nI've managed to scan the QR codes by literally redrawing the code with MSPaint :D And I've confirmed that the addresses are correct as I've been able to cross reference them on tickets.\n\nMy problem is this;  The code I have for my Public Key for this ether is 35 alpha-numeric characters.  From everything I've heard it should start with 0x, and be 40 characters long.\n\nI've tried entering the code into Ethplorer and others, but it's clearly the wrong format.\n\nI just want to check the balance at this address :(\n\nAny ideas?  Am I doing something completely wrong?  I'm new :D  I'd love to post a picture of the ticket but...  It's got my private keys on there :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\np.s.
