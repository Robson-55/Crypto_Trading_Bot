Basically, this dApp enables games made on the TIC-80 fantasy console to be minted into NFTs that are playable by their owners through the ethertic.io website. This creates a similar experience to game publishing in the young days of gaming, as an (effectively) limited supply of cartridges were manufactured with their contents set in stone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mwenvh/etherticio_playable_game_cartridge_nfts_for_the/,1,0
