And this token is just a pegged version of the actual ETH.\n\nAny person who does not believe in the bsc network will  not accept this ETH as currency, coz it will no show on the original eth blockchain.\n\nHow correct is my above understanding ?\n\n\nsecondary questions ; bep2 is for binance chain and bep20 is for binance smart chain .
