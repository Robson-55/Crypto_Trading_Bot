What causes this to fluctuate and what are my chances it will go up to 23% again? Instead of gaining 6k I have gained 0 now. Now Im wondering if I should just pull it all out and stop using this crap or if I should pray for it to go up to 23% again but lookign at the website it hasnt been up there in at least 1.5 months.
