I am selling to pay off a loan. The laptop has never been slow for me when run code, processing data, running 3d software, etc.\n\nIt also runs Minecraft ray tracing pretty well lol\n\nIf anyone has a price to name, lmk\nWill not take shitcoins, preferably ones without massive price fluctuations in a matter of minutes.\n\nBought this for 5000 dollars and is hardly even used, still in pristine condition.
