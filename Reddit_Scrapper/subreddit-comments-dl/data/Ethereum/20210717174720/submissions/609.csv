n561v7,1620184842,Has anybody invested in Grayscale Ethereum Trust?,"I know ultimately it would be best to invest in ethereum directly, but I am trying to gain exposure to crypto through an ira.  This seems like the easiest way to go about it.  I understand a self directed ira can be setup to invest in crypto, but the initial setup fee is quite high.  \n\nHas anybody here had any experience with Grayscale Ethereum Trust?  Other than the risk of the ethereum price going down are there other risk that I should be aware of?  I did notice on the chart that ETHE did not match ETH exactly as it should as it is supposed to hold approximately 0.01 eth.  \n\nI know there is a 2.5% fee built in however if you can hold ethereum in a tax free shelter, this should outweigh the fee.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n561v7/has_anybody_invested_in_grayscale_ethereum_trust/,1,21

n56xw6,1620187800,Comparing market cap of crypto to traditional public companies is meaningless,"I keep reading headlines like ""Ethereum is worth more than Honda"". The more I think about this the less it makes sense. Market cap for a publicly traded company represents the value of that company, stock price times total shares. ""Market cap"" for a crypto currency represents the total value of that currency, price times total coins in circulation. And in the case of Ethereum it strives to be nothing less than remaking the economy. A better comparison would be the total money in circulation of a fiat currency like USD. Or GDP of the nation's of the earth. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other serious crypto are going to get monumentally larger than even the biggest company in the world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n56xw6/comparing_market_cap_of_crypto_to_traditional/,1,26
n56y1b,1620187811,Error while transferring Eth from Matic network back to Ethereum network,"Hello everyone, I'm trying to transfer my ETH from Matic Network back to Ethereum Network using the bridge from the matic wallet ([https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)). I'm using the PoS bridge. After about 45 minutes of waiting, the transfer screen says ""Your transaction is checkpointed on Etherum network. You need to confirm one more transaction to get your funds in your ethereum account.""\n\nWhen I hit ""confirm"" on the bridge page, I get a small error message at the bottom of the screen that says ""Cannot read property ""transactionIndex"" of null.""\n\nMy ETH is no longer in my matic wallet and it has not reached my ethereum wallet. Please suggest ways to resolve this, as I am very concerned that I will lose my ETH :(\n\nThe transfer cost is $24 dollar in gas. Do you think maybe the issue is that I only have $18 in ETH in my ethereum wallet? I just assumed it would take the gas from my amount that is being transferred. Unfortunately I won't be able to add $6 in ETH to my wallet for about a week, but I'm really worried about what could happen if I don't resolve this tonight.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n56y1b/error_while_transferring_eth_from_matic_network/,1,1
