Their will also likely be a ""winner"" in terms of the decentralized platforms everything is built on top of (ETH, DOT, Cardano, etc.).\n\nI think the winner will be whoever can \n\nA.) Grow the largest users/developers base (probably the most important)\n\nB.) Be as decentralized as possible (there could be exceptions for Business)\n\nC.) Keep up in the high tech arms race (be able to grow and adapt the technology as needed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel that Eth has the best community and the most projects built on top of it. \n\nIs the most decentralized.\n\nIs lagging in technology but has the ability to adapt and keep up without disrupting the community ( ETH 2.0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you guys think there are any other projects that rival ETH in these 3 categories?

lb69fh,1612299546,Is it gone? Transaction stuck for 24 hours,"Hi all total noob here I said my FU to the stock market and joined crypto land as any sensible person would do. Last night I did a transaction to move my eth from my newton wallet to a metamask wallet. When I checked the transaction on [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) it says error out of gas but the status said confirmed in green. The eth never arrived so after a couple of hours I decided to do some research and I found a youtube vid that had a workaround where you send 0 eth from your metamask wallet and enter the address of the newton wallet that I sent it from and then add the nounce number of the pending transaction and it should move the stuck transaction. I checked the gas fee, picked the fastest option and sent it.\n\nAfter a full day the 0 eth I sent to unstick the transaction says pending yet I paid for the fastest rate and the original transaction has not gone through.  I have checked eth scan and the original transaction now says ""fail"" in the status and in the to field it says ""warning error encountered during contract execution(out of gas)"" and in the value field it shows the amount of eth I sent and it says ""canceled"". Is my eth gone? How can I get it back?\n\nI put a support ticket at my original wallet address from where I originally sent it from and no response since morning. I am getting frustrated wondering if it is all gone and if there is anything I can do to get it back.
