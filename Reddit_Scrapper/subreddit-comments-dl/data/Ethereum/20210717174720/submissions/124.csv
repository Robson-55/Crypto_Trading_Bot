igzyw8,1598452544,Legal side of a DAO in Germany?,Hello! \n\nDoes anybody know how the legal side of a DAO looks in Germany? \n\nIts hard finding information for this. Any input would be greatly appreciated. \n\nTechnically - one could just deploy a backend and a frontend for a DAO and accept payment in DAI or Eth and that would be that. But I have an inkling that that would be illegal. What kind of registration would be needed to deploy a DAO in germany? What kind of legal entity would be useful? Or would it make more sense to register a company in a more crypto-friendly EU-state?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/igzyw8/legal_side_of_a_dao_in_germany/,1,5
