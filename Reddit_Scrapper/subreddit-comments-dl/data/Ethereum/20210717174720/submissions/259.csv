khryna,1608589951,Interesting Question / Discussion on Flashloans offered by dydX and others...,"Hello all,\n\nI'm trying to wrap my head around the concept of flashloans. Would the following use case be possible, and if so wouldn't this be a huge flaw in future practical use of a cryptocurrency?\n\nUSE CASE:\n\n1. A ""credit card"" like IOT device be built that executes a flashloan to fund IRL purchases of goods (food, clothes, etc...)\n2. The user of the device receives the goods as the funds are successfully deposited into the merchants wallet(and then the user consumes the goods or leaves the premise)\n3. The transaction is reverted and the merchant does not actually receive any payment due to the flashloan defaulting\n\nWould the merchant be out of luck in this scenario or am I overthinking this? \n\nAppreciate any thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/khryna/interesting_question_discussion_on_flashloans/,1,0

khvy7x,1608603552,EIP 1559: Potential for a Layer 1 Public Goods Funding Mechanism?,"Proposal: \n\nWhat if a portion of the BASEFEE under EIP-1559 was put towards funding public goods and on-chain development rather than having 100% burned.  Instead, say 50% went towards funding public goods (which could even be matched under a quadratic funding model - potentially even by the protocol itself, though this would introduce inflation), with the remaining 50% BASEFEE burned.\n\nIssues:\n\nThe main issue I see with this is that it introduces the question of 'which public goods to fund' and, more importantly, *who decides* this.  Essentially this would require some sort of on-chain governance, which normally I would maintain should not be implemented at the Layer 1 protocol level -- however, if it was restricted to ONLY determining which external public goods to fund and nothing to do with on-chain economics or the functioning of the protocol itself...\n\nNot sure if this has been considered before.
