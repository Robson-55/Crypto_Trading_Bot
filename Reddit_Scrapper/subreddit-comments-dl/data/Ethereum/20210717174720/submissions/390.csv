A short while back I fell for the Elon Musk giveaway scam. The scammers cloned his website completely and coupled with the anxiety they created with the time limit which seemed to be quickly whittling down I panicked and led by my stupidity and greed I guess I sent them 1 Ethereum in the hopes of getting 5 or so back. Obviously it was a ruse and I was out of pocket half my total savings, not to mention Ethereum subsequently jumped to 3 times it's value a short while later leaving me to feel even dumber.\n\nIf you're out there and getting wrapped up in the excitement and also being exposed to mass media and legitimate endeavors from people like Musk which make these sort of scams more believable to the uninitiated, please be aware and learn from me. Don't be like me. Nothing is free. And nobody will ever give you anything for free.\n\nLOL. The regret is real and the fact that I fell for this is so humiliating. If you feel pity for my dumbass and wanna send me some ether please go ahead. üòÇ\n\nHave a great day everyone.\nP.

I know block time is about 12 seconds, but when you look at a [pending transaction chart](https://etherscan.io/chart/pendingtx), it's clear many transactions wait for many blocks before they get mined. This would give a better sense of actual real-life transaction processing times and allow some interesting analysis when mapped against gas paid in those transactions. For my purposes, averages per block would be fine, perhaps someone else would actually like to see it by transaction.\n\nDoes anyone know of a site or tool to get this data?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lldur9/time_mined_transactions_had_been_in_mempool/,1,1
