Since USDC settles on the ethereum blockchain, transactions can close in a little a\[s\] 20 seconds and, importantly, can be done for nearly free, Visa believes its vast array of merchants could choose to use this nearly instant alternative form of payment. ‚Äú""We worked closely with digital currency wallets to issue Visa credentials,‚Äù"" says Sheffield.

lbxj0a,1612384530,Struggling to find any clear cut staking guide for a layman,"Right now I have my eth (10 eth) on blockfi simply because it is **extremely** simple and intuitive. A grandma could figure it out. That said, it is centralized and I want to get my eth staked to earn more eth. Initially, I wanted to get it on a defi platform and lend it but I have had too hard of a time trusting some of the platforms. I understand that lenders are, for the most part, covered on defi in the event of an issue but for psychological reasons, I haven't been able to muster the strength to do it.   \n\n\nSo, at this point, I have come to the possibility of staking my eth but I have found the material out there regarding staking is not very digestible to the average joe (I have a solid understanding of the crypto space including blockchains, bitcoin, defi, etc, etc but I am not an engineer). Some other POS coins are extremely simple. You can stake from a hard wallet and you can withdrawal from a pool whenever you like. Also, the fees to do this are very low or almost non-existent. From what I am seeing some validator pools on eth have fees of well over 15% of staking rewards. \n\nSo, from a person from my perspective (non-engineer but an above-average understanding of crypto and so on) would you guys recommend that I stake to a pool? I have considered using the Kraken exchange to stake just due to its ease of use. Also, does anyone have any insight into how long stakes will not be able to be removed? Could this process take 1 year? 2 years? More? Kraken and other sources say that rewards can range from 5-17%. Is that true? \n\nTL;DR: For someone who is not an engineer but has a deep understanding of crypto otherwise, do you believe it would be worthwhile for me to stake my eth? If so, where is the easiest, safest, and also cheapest place to do so? \n\np.s. please bear with me.
