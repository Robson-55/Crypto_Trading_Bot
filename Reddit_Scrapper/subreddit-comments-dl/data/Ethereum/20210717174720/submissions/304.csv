kwy9fh,1610598326,"Ethereum, The internet for Markets. (An easy guide for newbies)","What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a platform built using blockchain that allows digital assets to be traded without a middle man. It uses this by using something called smart contracts. An easy way of explaining it would be the ""Internet for Financial Markets"". \n\nJust how the Internet connects computers so information can be transacted freely, Ethereum connects Buyers and sellers so they can also transact easy. On Ethereum, anyone can make a token to represent anything, from a house title, a car title, a State currency, gold, stocks, commodities, ect. When a token is built on Ethereum, it can then be traded easily with out a middle man; just like information travels through the internet without a middle man. Since Ethereum is an internet of markets, not only can you trade anything on Ethereum, you can trade any asset for any other asset. \n\nHypothetically lets say you have the deed to your house on the Ethereum blockchain and you want to sell that house for Tesla stock. Well with Ethereum this is possible. Even if no one wants to buy your house with Tesla stock, Ethereum can automatically sell your house for US dollars, then in the same transaction use those dollars to buy tesla stock for the price you requested. These type of transactions are possible for for any asset that is built on Ethereum. The significance of this is that it makes a liquid market for any asset. \n\nThe purpose of Ether, the native token for the Ethereum blockchain, is that Ether is what is used as the transaction fee for the network. Any transaction that happens on the network has to pay a small fee in Ether for the transaction to go through. This is what makes Ethereum so attractive as an investment. If everyone needs to use this coin to transact on the network, then the demand for the coin will be high. \n\nCurrently there are hundreds of applications on Ethereum that allow you to buy, sell, loan, or borrow thousands of different tokens. If you decide to loan your USDC (Ethereum's bank backed stable coin) on an Ethereum application, you could make around a 4% variable interest rate on your money (Try to get that from a savings account). Other applications allow you to participate in lotteries where losing tickets don't lose value and prediction markets to bet on real world event. With Ethereum, possibilities are endless. \n\n**Potential Risk:** Like any investment, there are some risk for this coin. First, Ethereum can only handle around 15 transactions per second. This means that the more people that try to use Ethereum, the less efficient it will be. Over the last few weeks, users of Ethereum saw transaction fees go up to $50+ for a single smart contract transaction. Although there are plans to make Ethereum more scalable in the future, accomplishing this goal will take a few years at best.\n\nSmart contract hacks are another risk of Ethereum. Smart contracts are the programs on Ethereum that give instructions to what you want the transaction to do. Sometimes these contracts get hacked taking all the assets that the contracts can hold. Although that is usually the fault of the smart contract programmer, it is still something that is not uncommon on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nCurrently Ethereum is the most used and trusted smart contract blockchain. Although it has its flaws, developers are working around the clock to fix these issues and make the best product they can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kwy9fh/ethereum_the_internet_for_markets_an_easy_guide/,1,50

kwz456,1610601535,The dApp for salaries in Ethereum (Vitalik's dream),"Vitalik Buterin said somewhere that he regrets that Ethereum doesn't produce enough jobs/salaries.\n\nVitalik was unable to solve this problem, I did. I fully developed (except only for the audit of smart contracts) an MVP a dApp that incentivizes the market to calculate and pay salaries in Ethereum. This dApp is especially useful to pay salaries to scientists and free software developers. It is also useful for such things as carbon accounting.\n\nThe dApp principle is tricky:\n\n* It locks money for an extended period of time (such as 100 years) and unlocks it to ""winning"" traders (by a principle very similar to prediction markets from gambling) after this time period passes. (Will many enough traders strive for 100-years long profits? We should also consider shortening the period (maybe to 50 years), but if just a small number of traders does want long time profits, it will be enough for the system to work.)\n* My math calculations show that if traders a. do use very simple principles for profit maximization; b. (especially, best of them) predict future well-enough, then it is ""money transfer from the future"": the sum withdrawn in the present is equal (relative to market sizes) to the sum put in the future. So we can gather donations during 100 years in the future and transfer them to pay salaries now!\n* The hardest issue to solve was that for this to work we need to create an oracle that will score the scientists' ratings to determine their salaries. It appeared to be impossible, but I realized that we can allocate a part of the prediction market rewards to search engine owners who would build oracles for us.\n* Scores for scientists and software developers will be determined in the future: But we with a high confidence can assume that it highly correlates with the number of direct and indirect citations of a scientific work or software package and also with it being released under an open-source license.\n* We accept not only donations but also have a clever system of bequests: If anyone doesn't want to donate, why not to bequest? So we can get much more money than other systems, I just call everyone to bequest all his or her funds to my dApp.\n\nSo, scientists get paid accordingly the real value of their work: the interest in their research after 100 years. It is the fair way to pay salaries for free software and science!! No need for universities and state funding anymore.\n\nNow, as I said, the MVP is ready. I need exactly $3000 for contracts audit + some money for contracts deployment. Somebody, please help me to accomplish this. (I do have $3000, but I am considering tradeoffs, such as being able to pay for advertising it to kick-start the project afterwards.) Please contact me if you want to donate. (There is a grant on GitCoin, but it is now not in donations a match period; so donors please keep in contact with me.)\n\nLinks:\n\n* [Demo app](https://vporton.github.io/future-salary/#/) (it misses donations in ETH instead of tokens and missed advanced bequests, I am working on this and have partially done it, as it can be added even after releasing an MVP on the mainnet.)\n* [Temporary site](https://reward.portonvictor.org/) (significantly outdated, I added a few new ideas/changes to my dApp afterwards).\n* [Source code](https://github.com/vporton/donations) (see also dependencies).\n\n$3000 and all the world including you gets big, just salaries!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kwz456/the_dapp_for_salaries_in_ethereum_vitaliks_dream/,1,59
