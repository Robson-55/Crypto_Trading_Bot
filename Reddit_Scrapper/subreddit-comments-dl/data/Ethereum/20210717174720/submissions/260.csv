ki8jai,1608654423,Noob Developer Question Regarding the Logic of Dapps &amp; Smart Contracts.,"Hi there,\n\nWhile I've tinkered a little, I am not a professional developer in the conventional software space. Thus trying to reframe my head around Dapp logic is doing my head in. I have a question that isn't coding related, but more about the logic of smart contracts and interacting with them. I'm hoping someone could help.\n\n**Okay, so here's the scenario and question.**\n\n* There's a very simple Dapp. All it does is list people on a register + outline the protocols (1) to allow you to get on the register and (2) benefits when you are on the register.\n* A public client-side will allow people to view this register.\n* A simple smart contract will add people to the register, along with a few properties of the newly added people.\n* **BUT THE QUESTION IS: How do I, or can I, stop third parties calling the smart contract and effectively adding (random) people to the register whenever they want?**\n\nMy understanding was that any respectable project will make their smart contracts public &amp; verifiable (perhaps even able to be decompiled).\n\n*So what is the logic that should be used to make sure that it's not possible for anyone to call the smart contract and erroneously add people to the 'register'?*\n\n**What am I missing here?**\n\nThanks, in advance, for any advice. Plus I hope you don't mind if I cut &amp; paste this question into another sub.\n\nCheers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ki8jai/noob_developer_question_regarding_the_logic_of/,1,3

kicy3p,1608667660,Fake Uniswap Liquidity or How to Make 5 ETH in 20 mins,"Everyone knows to watch out for fake tokens on Uniswap, but marketing a fake token and setting up a bunch of social accounts in an attempt to get people to buy your fake tokens is a lot of work! Luckily this is the blockchain; it turns out you don't even need to market your new token to get people to buy it as there are already folks waiting to buy your new token at low, low prices.\n\nTake this account for example: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x515f197a769893befb4388d3db087e311bd1b2b5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x515f197a769893befb4388d3db087e311bd1b2b5)\n\nThey create a fake contract with some dot-finance token name (maybe these are real shitcoin names, who knows), add \~15 ETH worth of liquidity and their newly minted tokens, wait for the price to go up as others buy the token and then promptly remove their liquidity at the new price of 1.3x what they put in. Bam, easy money. Make a new address, move some of your eth, deploy a new contract and start again. It takes less than an hour usually and in this case just 20 minutes to make 5 ETH.\n\nBut how do you find people to buy your new fake token?\n\nHere's where the interesting part comes in: people are always watching the blockchain for ways to make money, and one of those ways is watching new tokens that get deployed and get fresh liquidity injections on uniswap (method signature \`0xf305d719\`). In a neutral world this is a great plan, get in on new tokens before everyone else can catch on, get first dibs on new tokens and then sell when the masses arrive via the official token marketing push. But the market isn't neutral and clearly people deploy fake contracts and provide them with fake liquidity to take advantage of people who think they're getting in early.\n\nSo the new contract markets itself... even if no one actually believes it's for a real purpose.\n\nDo the token buyers actually care about the token? Are they bots or simply people trying to make a quick buck as part of someone else's scheme? Who knows. Usually they're left holding the bag, it's not a business I would encourage anyone to get in, even if you think you're fast.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kicy3p/fake_uniswap_liquidity_or_how_to_make_5_eth_in_20/,1,11
