nunxxi,1623100850,The Limits to Blockchain Scalability on vitalik.ca,"At the end of the article Vitalik writes this: \n\n&gt; Quantifying this risk is easy. Take the blockchain's data capacity in MB/sec, and multiply by ~30 to get the amount of data stored in terabytes per year. The current sharding plan has a data capacity of ~1.3 MB/sec, so about 40 TB/year. If that is increased by 10x, this becomes 400 TB/year. If we want the data to be not just accessible, but accessible conveniently, we would also need metadata (eg. decompressing rollup transactions), so make that 4 petabytes per year, or 40 petabytes after a decade. The Internet Archive uses 50 petabytes. So that's a reasonable upper bound for how large a sharded blockchain can safely get.\n\n&gt; Hence, it looks like on both of these dimensions, the Ethereum sharding design is actually already roughly targeted fairly close to reasonable maximum safe values. The constants can be increased a little bit, but not too much.\n\nI don't really understand how this is going to work. If the blockchain gets this big then only archive.org or other providers will be able to run full nodes. I'm sure there's something I'm missing but I'm not sure what it is. Is it actually planned that in the future of Ethereum you'll need petabyte storage to run a full node?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nunxxi/the_limits_to_blockchain_scalability_on_vitalikca/,3,9

nurfvv,1623110742,Portfolio Just bought 11K of Ethereum in its first week. A crypto that invest," **What is Portfolio Token?**  \n\-PORTFOLIO is a token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It‚Äôs the first of its kind utility token that invest into promising assets such as real estate, promising crypto coins, stock and others to back its value, stability, and overall worth, all while increasing it‚Äôs holders‚Äô profits.\n\nHow does this make Portfolio different?\n\nAll crypto is still crypto but when you break into something that actually exists that's when it becomes interesting and a long term play. What would actually happen if some tokens just disappear? Nothing non virtual people would lose money and some websites would go down but business will go on as usual. When you have something tangible it can't just disappear.  \nPortfolio will be a tangible token even when crypto crashes.\n\n**How does the investor benefit?**  \nThe investor will get 3X reflections when holding the coin.  \n\- Every time someone buys/sells of PTF token.  \n\- Every time someone An asset gets bought  \n\- Every time the profit goes into the Liquidity Pool\n\nWhile inflating the LP we create a more stable market for the Token to grow in.  \nOnce we hit the exchange all the profit of the assets will get distributed among the holders according to their holding share benefitting all those who have been holding.\n\n**How does PORTFOLIO invest?**  \n\- PORTFOLIO has a 10% transaction fee for every trade. 5% is awarded to each holder automatically  \nwhile the other 5% is put into a separate investment wallet. This wallet is publicly displayed on our  \nassets page of the website. Every week 60% of the investment wallet will be converted to BNB to  \ninvest into assets. This transaction will generate another 5% payout to the holders. Of the leftover  \n40% we will then burn 5% of the token and the remaining 35% will be paired with profits from our  \ninvestments and put into the liquidity pool.\n\n**How often do investments and payouts occur?**  \n\-Investments will take place weekly. Profits gained from investments will be distributed bi-weekly.\n\n**Can the community invest in upcoming investments?**  \n\-Absolutely, we encourage the community to  \nengage in the voting for investments. More announcements to come.\n\n**In the event of a loss or no profit of an investment, what would happen?**  \n\-The best part about this token is that the holders assume no risk but only stand to gain when an  \ninvestment gains a profit. For example: If Portfolio purchases 1 Bitcoin at 40K and it increases to 60K,  \nwe will be able to pay out 20K to holders. If we purchased bitcoin at 40K and then it dropped to 30K,  \nwe would just hold the asset with no loss to the holders. Once the asset surpasses its purchase price,  \nall profits will then be paid out.\n\n**What platforms can PORTFOLIO be purchased on?**  \n\-As of now, Pancakeswap is the only exchange that the token is available on.\n\nDevs are doxxed, full names + Linkedin will be posted on the website once it's updated.\n\nContract: 0x307204863f3bc29D1a874E38aCe62114a8990c4e\n\nTokenomics:\n\n* 5% distribution to Holders - &gt; 5% of every transaction is distributed directly into your wallet.\n* 5% goes into a separate investment wallet.  \nThis wallet is publicly displayed on our assets page of the website.\n* Locked liquidity\n* Assets profit goes into the LP to inflate it and create a more stable token.\n* üì∑ Useful links  \n\- [Portfolio Token website:](https://www.portfoliotoken.net/)  \nüì∑ Social  \n\- [Telegram:](https://t.me/PTFLounge)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nurfvv/portfolio_just_bought_11k_of_ethereum_in_its/,1,1
