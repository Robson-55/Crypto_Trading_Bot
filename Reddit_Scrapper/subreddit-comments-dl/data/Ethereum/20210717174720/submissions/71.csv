hr5tdt,1594747800,Ethereum is the ultimate peacemaker," was inspired by this comment to write a reply but it turned out a bit big and thought it could deserve its own post.\n\n2020, where anyone with a few dollars can have a taste of being a multi millionaire for a few seconds.\n\nGiving access to anyone to personally experience and profit of the truth that money can make money. Truly democratizing finance and thus nearly everything as a consequence.\n\nI think it's still highly underestimated just how influential blockchain will be in the coming decades. It's the tool that will be responsible for uniting all of humanity beyond country, culture and skin color. A tool that unites everyone exactly because it is fueled by the existing divide. The ultimate peace maker. I'm sure there will be unforeseen negatives too but I suspect they will be minor in comparison.\n\nReality coming full circle. It's truly beautiful. Though we might just all die tomorrow due to the wrong tweet pissing off the wrong person that was able to launch nukes with the click of a finger. We're so close and also have never been this fragile as a species.\n\nWhy is this aspect of blockchain not being talked about? Is it simply too early? Are we deliberately avoiding politics despite the obvious enormous political impact? Trying to stay under the radar of politicians? Or simply too busy with shorter near them goals?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hr5tdt/ethereum_is_the_ultimate_peacemaker/,3,1
