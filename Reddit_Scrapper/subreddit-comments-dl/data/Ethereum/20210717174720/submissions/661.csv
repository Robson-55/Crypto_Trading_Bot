nbarb9,1620889922,"Elon bullish about Crypto, not about POW.","Originally posted in CryptoCurrency, but removed coz not enough KARMA!\n\n\nSo we all saw Elon's tweet today. He's a business man and he'll always have his own interests. That not that hard to understand. \n\nWhat he mainly said is: He thinks crypto is the future, but Bitcoin's proof of work is literally too much work. I think moving forward, pow currencies like Bitcoin needs to answer these questions:\n1) Is there really no better alternative than POW? An alternative that reduces both power and equipment costs. \n2) Can coins (Bitcoin) really be able to move from POW, with mining companies already invested billions in setup?\n3) If they remain POW, can it compete with non POW coins in the future? \n\nIn my opinion, POW is not the only way to make DeFi work. And in the future, the coin who does it correctly might get the crown, not necessary the coin that had the head start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nbarb9/elon_bullish_about_crypto_not_about_pow/,1,35
nbas80,1620890037,Something really amazing has happened yesterday...,"Headlines: VB has donated $1B worth of Shiba Inu token to India Covid-Crypto Relief fund. \n\nBut is this as simple as it looks? \n\nFor all you don't know, the dev who created shiba, sent 50% of the supply to VB's wallet. why did he do that? It was to pin the burden on the shoulder of someone with accountability. \nVB is the face of crypto world unlike Satoshi Nakamoto. By doing this the shib dev was able to ensure that ""if ever"" shiba grew too big, VB would be in a position where he has to keep the tokens in his wallet as ""burnt"" token without profiting on them. A moral obligation. A man of his stature can't afford to do a rugpull and benefit off retail investor's money without taking the whole crypto ecosystem down with him. \nMight be a stupid move. Might be a brilliant. \nHe pinned the burden of decentralisation on VB's shoulder by giving him the control of the power, that is, 50% of the supply! \n\nNow our man, VB is a very smart. He carried this burden all along. But then with all the shitcoins/memecoins coming into this space, people getting rugpulled, investing without thinking anything, also not to mention making his network congested and skyrocket the transaction fees, he played a very smart move. \n\nHe showed the world he still can do what he isn't supposed to do! He still can touch and move and do anything with the ""burnt"" token being sent to his wallet. He acted and moved 5% of the shib's supply to a charity fund! And held the rest 45%. The tokens which were supposed to be sitting worthless in his wallet, are now $1B worth sitting in a relief fund. \n\n\nWith one brilliant move, he has shown the world how scary centralisation could be! A single powerful person who is in control of the majority stake can create FUD in the market with one transaction! Warned investors about the potential risks of chasing pump and dumps. And at the same time he also showed us the power of the community, the power of decentralisation, where people by the sheer power of their demand have turned something worthless, a shitcoin, a memecoin, which had no value to start with, into $1B worth of investment which is gonna save lives! \n\n\nIT'S BRILLIANT, IRONIC, AND BEAUTIFUL ALL AT THE SAME TIME!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nbas80/something_really_amazing_has_happened_yesterday/,1,11
