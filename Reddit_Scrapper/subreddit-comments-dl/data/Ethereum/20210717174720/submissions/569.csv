n003ks,1619561633,Other than staking what can I do with my ETH?,Iâ€™m just getting back into crypto after a long hiatus (got out just before the 2017 run ;-;)\n\nIâ€™m now getting back in because I am receiving my inheritance from my fathers unfortunate passing last year and I am starting to explore the best ways to invest. I knew I wanted to get back into crypto and BTC and ETH seemed to be the best ones to start with. I currently have about $1k in BTC and just under 1 ETH since after research I felt it had more potential.\n\nNow to the actual question what can I actually do with my ETH? I saw lots of recommendations against just throwing it in a cold wallet. The most suggested was staking and I plan to either stake on Kraken or Rocketpool when available (if I can with the amount I have). I also plan to continuously invest a bit into ETH over the next few months when I receive paychecks so should I wait until I have more ETH to stake or can I continuously add to the amount I am staking? \n\nI donâ€™t plan on selling for a few years so thatâ€™s why staking seems optimal but I have also heard there are other things I can do with my ETH but havenâ€™t found concrete details. If anyone could elaborate for a bit of a newb I would appreciate it!,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n003ks/other_than_staking_what_can_i_do_with_my_eth/,1,18
