m2t0f7,1615477159,Transferring wETH to ETH,"Hey everybody,\n\nI'm pretty new to all of this Krypto- and NFT-Stuff, so maybe I'm just missing an obvious thing.\n\nI tried bidding on some NFTs via Rarible.\nI transferred 0.306 ETH from my ""MEW Wallet"" to wETH (Raribles Bidding currency). Since my bid failed, I now want to transfer those back to ETH into my Wallet. I tried doing this and it always fails. I can click the Button to transfer back, I set the amount (I also tried transferring less), and confirm the transaction within the app of MEW. But then it shows an error every time, even though i confirmed and verified it within the app.\n\nMEW: 0.001 ETH\nRarible: 0.306 wETH\n\nIs it because of the fees? Are those withdrawn from my Wallet and theres just not enough ETH on it? I thought the fees are withdrawn from my transferred amount.\nWhat can I do to get my ETH back?\n\nThanks for your help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/m2t0f7/transferring_weth_to_eth/,1,5
