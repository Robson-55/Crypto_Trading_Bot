ia1ar4,1597466359,I've Been Debating Mining Lately. What's Your Experience With Using A Typical Gaming Computer?,I've sporadically kept up with Ethereum news over the last few years but have gotten very interested with the mainstream launch of the DeFi platforms. I've decided that I would like to begin hedging my stock portfolio with interest earning protocols like Compound.\n\nI think mining would be a pretty manageable source of revenue that can also be used to at least pay gas fees transferring to Compound. I've been interested in building my own computer for awhile and figured now would be a good time to hit two birds with one stone.\n\nWhat's been your experience with mining via a gaming desktop? I've been eyeing the AMD RX 5700 XT  both for its gaming capability and the projections on [minerstat.com](https://minerstat.com) have it in the green significantly given my energy costs. I know eventually Ethereum will switch to PoS but I would like to start since (as far as I have understood) switching to other Ethash token shouldn't be much of an issue in both mining and converting to Ethereum.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ia1ar4/ive_been_debating_mining_lately_whats_your/,1,22
