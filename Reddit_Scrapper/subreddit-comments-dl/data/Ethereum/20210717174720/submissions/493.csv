mikjxs,1617370675,Why try using any defi apps right now as opposed to staking ETH or other coins that earn interest on an exchange like coinbase?,"With gas fees so high to use any defi apps, it seems the cheapest option to earn any interest right now is to stake ETH2/USDC/DAI/etc and wait until fees are lower in the future at some point (which could be years?). I would love to use some of these dapps like compound, yearnfinace, pooltogether but without depositing high amounts the fees are too high for me.

miog0w,1617382681,[OFF] HOW MONERO WORKS AND HOW IT'S DIFFERENT FROM BITCOIN?,"The leading cryptocurrency whose behavior affects the entire digital currency market is bitcoin. Its dominance is around 60% and it marks the cycles through which this market moves. When it began to be noticed at the beginning of its existence, and investors saw opportunities in it, other cryptocurrencies were created in its wake. They tried to ultimately solve various problems and shortcomings that were noticed in the bitcoin network. As we can see, most of them ended with a poor result, and only some of them managed to break through on the market.\n\nWhat problems were identified with the Bitcoin (BTC) network?\n\n‚ÄúOne of the downsides of Bitcoin (BTC) that is often blamed on it is its lack of anonymity. Although the addresses between which we send our funds are difficult to assign to a specific person, we can track in detail what amounts are transferred between them, at what time, and how often the transaction takes place. ‚Äù ‚Äì Said Tomasz Kabarowski, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange office\n\n[Link for the Original post](https://cryptomode.com/how-monero-works-and-how-it-differs-from-bitcoin/?utm_source=coingecko&amp;utm_content=coingecko&amp;utm_campaign=coingecko&amp;utm_medium=coingecko&amp;utm_term=coingecko)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/miog0w/off_how_monero_works_and_how_its_different_from/,1,1
