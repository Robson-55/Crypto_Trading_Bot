glauc4,1589698005,Ethereum as layer 2 solution for Bitcoin,"Ethereum has surely propelled the big brother‚Äôs huge entry into DeFi. The data is evidence of this. Bitcoin‚Äôs high store of value and liquidity can be a game-changer in DeFi. Now, it has the support of Ethereum dapp eco-system. The combination of Bitcoin and Ethereum can provide massive reward to the world by kick-starting a plethora of new financial applications. The two biggest blockchains can complement each other to overcome own weakness. Bitcoin can provide liquidity to Etherem and Ethereum can provide scalability to Bitcoin to develop a new financial system.

gleht7,1589718104,Designing a cryptocurrency from scratch | Youtube series," \n\nHi members of [r](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/)eddit\n\nI recently took a lecture for my college juniors on the topic of cryptocurrencies. In the lecture, I try to design a robust cryptocurrency from scratch. I try to bring in as much logic as possible behind every design choice and try to map out the requirements that lead us to a particular choice. I have edited a few initial parts of my lecture and uploaded on the Youtube. [The link is right here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu02IBETbYI&amp;list=PLaIofjjTtcOIOxXBEqsdxGi5TDSHxAD7w)\n\nLink: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu02IBETbYI&amp;list=PLaIofjjTtcOIOxXBEqsdxGi5TDSHxAD7w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu02IBETbYI&amp;list=PLaIofjjTtcOIOxXBEqsdxGi5TDSHxAD7w)\n\nPlease do have a look. As there are really experienced people here, I request everyone to provide me feedback as to how I can improve the videos. I am not a content creator and so there can be a lot of issues with the series. I request all of you to please have a look and provide me essential critique. I would love to build upon your suggestions.\n\nPlease let me know if I have missed something or if I have conveyed something wrong and I will try to rectify it.\n\nLooking forward to your suggestions.
