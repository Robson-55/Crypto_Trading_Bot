lrjrfz,1614191300,Coding question regarding Solidity from a newbie,"I've managed to deploy my smart contract on both my private truffle network and a testnet.\n\nIf I try running a function from the testnet that writes data, I'm always returned an error:\n\n""unknown account""\n\nIf I try running that same function from my private network, my data is updated without even requesting permission.

lrmuo1,1614199097,What do you think will be the catalyst for mass consumer adoption of the Ethereum network?,"My instinct is that this price action is not (yet) supported by utility, but by speculation. Ethereum's use case is stronger than the general public recognizes, but I believe it is possible that the price is outpacing its adoption due to its association with Bitcoin which is garnering institutional demand since it is a finished product. In my opinion, the most prominent catalyst for mass awareness of Ethereum's utility (and ultimate adoption in daily life) would be one of the following:\n\n* A Robinhood-like trading platform that allows fee-less trading of stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate etc. that people can understand (rather than just altcoins)\n* A largely recognized private firm (probably blockchain-related firm) going public via government-regulated ICO\n* An already publicly listed firm raising additional funds via ICO\n* A subscription service allowing monthly payments via smart contracts using stablecoins\n* To a lesser extent, large banks using stablecoins to settle overnight loans\n\nI'm curious about anybody else's opinions on this, and perhaps some of you already know about these types of projects underway that I could research.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lrmuo1/what_do_you_think_will_be_the_catalyst_for_mass/,12,12
