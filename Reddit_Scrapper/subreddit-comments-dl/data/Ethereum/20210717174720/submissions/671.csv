If I stake my eth can i also add to it monthly? Also, can I add eth that I don‚Äôt have to stake so I can mess around without it being fixed for two years? For example I‚Äôd have 2,000 staked that I would add 300 to every month, then also 1000 unstaked.

nctn9q,1621065634,Is ethereum capable of rolling out a solution for companies like Vechain is doing? Is it possible for 2022?,"So far I understand that ethereum is great for individuals to earn interest on their coins through Defi and i love that but i am also curious on how soon ethereum can be used by businesses to solve their problems. My understanding is that companies like IBM are using ""private"" blockchain versions of ethereum to help them make their operations more efficient but these blockchains dont use ether cuz they are centralized. I understand that Vechain is mainly a supply chain focused blockchain and they have a lot of projects being developed but I dont think any of them are finalized and working yet however it seems at least some of these supply chain projects will use Vechain ""public"" blockchain (therefore VET or VTHO tokens would be used). I have been only 3 months in the crypto world so feel free to roast me üòÖ if any of my statements are wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nctn9q/is_ethereum_capable_of_rolling_out_a_solution_for/,1,2

ncu1bd,1621067222,"Since the beginning of 2021, DeFi protocols have suffered up to $156 million in losses from attacks.","The attacks targeting the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry caused $156 million in losses, while the total loss of the entire crypto market, according to blockchain data analytics firm CipherTrace is $432 million.\n\nThis amount of damage is higher than the total loss from attacks on the DeFi protocol for all of 2020. The $156 million figure doesn't even include ""DeFi-related"" scams (DeFi- related fraud) worth $83.4 million.\n\nDeFi is a decentralized industry with a focus on protocols using blockchain technology. Transactions are completely processed by smart contracts instead of a traditional bank or an investment management unit, and thus will ensure fairness and transparency for all participants.\n\nThe problem, however, is that smart contracts still have to be created by developers: the risk on the part of hackers is great, but if developers create a system of protocols that allows them to secretly withdraw funds at will, what about secret? It can be said that DeFi is inherently a form of high-risk investment, even in an inherently risky financial ecosystem.\n\nAccording to data from DeFi Pulse, TVL in DeFi is now $85 billion compared to $16 billion on January 1, 2021. This has attracted a lot of hacker groups with big deals like: Yearn.Finance ($11 million) in February, Roll ($5.7 million) in March, EasyFi, Furucombo, Dodo, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ncu1bd/since_the_beginning_of_2021_defi_protocols_have/,1,0

Probably not, but can‚Äôt hurt to ask. \n\nBack in 2018, I was playing with small amounts of some crypto and had purchased about 0.41 Ether on Coinbase. (1/29/18 per Coinbase transaction history). Shortly thereafter, I sent that 0.41 Ether somewhere. I have the transaction details including the transaction hash and the address of where it was sent. But I can‚Äôt seem to figure out where exactly I sent it. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be in my Ledger Nano (where I put most things) but it‚Äôs also not sitting on any exchange that I was using at the time (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp).\n\nSo ‚Äî armed only with the trans hash and the recipient address, is there any way to know where I sent this Ether?  I‚Äôm presuming it‚Äôs lost, and I know it‚Äôs not a big chunk of chain, but I‚Äôd love to find/recover it if possible. \n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ncxl07/wherefore_are_thou_ether/,1,13
