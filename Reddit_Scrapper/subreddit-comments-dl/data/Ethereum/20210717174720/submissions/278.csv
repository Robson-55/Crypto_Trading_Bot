kpwd99,1609718411,Offline MEW wallet vs. hardware wallet,"This is really two questions:\n\n1) I've made an offline MEW wallet with an airgapped Tails environment and generated my private key. I then successfully sent Eth to and from that address using offline json transfer etc. to confirm that I can control the wallet. Now my question is: in the event of catastrophe do I need to know my public address too or just the private key? I've always thought just the private key, but if a private key can generate countless public addresses then how would you know which public address to look at when recovering from your seed words? **If I look up any other public addresses related to my wallet, they show balances of 0**. Only one public address shows a balance - the one I sent my funds to. What am I missing here? I am under the impression that only private keys are necessary for recovery but failing to see how that would work.\n\n2) With all of this in mind, my motivation for an offline MEW wallet was to avoid closed-source devices like Ledger. Am I being unreasonable with my conviction that closed-source hardware wallets are untrustworthy or suboptimal?

kpxgd3,1609721978,Sales taxes are a burden for business - A thought experiment with ethereum.,"**Intro**\n\nI've been an e-commerce dev for a bunch of years, and as a result I have become exposed to the nitty gritty of how businesses collect and remit sales taxes. Over the last handful of years or so, it's _mostly_ become a solved problem ... kind of. I can't speak for anyone outside the US, but I know that it's a lot easier for non-US businesses when it comes to certain aspects (I may be wrong, I know VAT in Europe can be troublesome). I also can't really speak for many US states where sales taxes are fairly simple (or non-existent). I'm going to keep referring to sales taxes in this post, but I want you to keep in mind that they could also be an analog for some other aspect of business finance that I am not thinking about - ie any time there is a ""fee"" which can't be figured out until you know who your customer is.\n\n**Sales tax basics**\n\nSo here in my state, the way sales tax works is that as a business when a customer comes into your brick and mortar store and buys something, they pay the tax based on which jurisdictions your business exists in. This is true anywhere. You'll often have a few different taxes that add up to the total tax which may include state tax, county tax, city tax, and other special districts which can be a million different things like a region that all pays for public transit with sales taxes. This is pretty simple, relatively, and it's easy to know what to charge your customer _before_ they walk in the door.\n\n**Sales tax not-so-basics**\n\nBut it isn't always so simple. The product you sell might have options for delivery. In which case (and depending on what state you're in), the customer comes in the store, brings something to the register to pay, and then they say ""I want this thing delivered to my house which is in another city."" The Point of Sale software (POS) will then need a different way to handle how to figure the tax. In some places, this might just be a basic two-dimensional table with a ZIP code that maps to a set of taxes to charge. That's not the case here. You basically cannot accurately determine sales tax unless you enter a specific address and some other computer system takes that address and converts it into a point on a map and then it will look at any other geographic shapes that overlap the point. If the point is inside the shape (which might be a county, a city, a state, etc) then it says ""okay charge this tax"" and if it is inside multiple shapes it says ""here's the few different taxes broken down by type - city/state/etc.\n\nI recall some US federal act from I think the 80s that is kind of related here (I don't remember the name of the act). But this act has to do with cell phones and sales taxes and was done so that your cell provider could determine where to charge you sales tax based on where you used the phone most often and _not_ where you had the bill sent. It determines this through tower triangulation. Again, I don't recall the name of this or know if it's still used, but it's an interesting comparison.\n\n**Third-party services**\n\nUntil recently, there's been basically two ways to figure out the sales tax you needed to charge a customer. First, you looked it up manually. You use some system which might be provided by your state or some third-party and you entered those values in an order for tax. This is a bad way to do it because there could be human error during input, the database you're looking up might be out of date, etc. The other way to do it is to subscribe to a service which helps automate this. There's a few companies out there that specialize in this. You pay them a monthly fee and/or a transaction fee each time you look up. For example, our business has used a service which is like $80/mo for 1000 lookups and each additional lookup is $0.08 each. Keep in mind, this doesn't mean an actual _sale_ is happening, you're simply inputting an address and it gives you a table of which taxes apply. You might just be giving a customer a quote which they don't purchase for a few weeks. So each individual sale will have on average more than one lookup. The service we use is very basic, but there are others that are more complex and end up being a regular monthly fee. I have done estimates for our business and it would cost us multiple thousands of dollars a month for a service that exists only to tell us how much to charge customers.\n\n**Misc scenarios**\n\nThere are also a million other situations where things change. Maybe your city charges a sugar tax. Maybe the product is not taxable because it's a basic need. Maybe there is an exemption for a charity. The possibilities are limited only by the imagination of various political jurisdictions. \n\n**Why am I posting this on r/ethereum?**\n\nSo this brings me to the main point and where I see smart contracts coming into play and being useful. Doing all this work to manage sales taxes is burdensome for businesses and without experience or a CPA or other resources, it becomes a drain. The main reason for this drain is that you need to have a system built to handle every possible situation for every customer and product. For some businesses, they might not even bother to do it correctly, leading to customers being over or undercharged.\n\nI have seen this personally when I have bought a drink that was charged a sugar tax despite it being exempt from the tax. The law is so complex that the business owner probably just charges it on everything rather than trying to figure out each individual drink's status. Or there might be a situation where the business is using a software system they have paid for, but the software is inaccurate. I recently discovered the giant gaping hole in how Shopify handles sales taxes despite their claims otherwise. Any business in our state using their service for a website or POS will either be doing it incorrectly or paying thousands of dollars a month to do it sort of correctly. \n\n**So how can ETH help?**\n\nI was thinking about this last night and a very simple thought came into my head that is kind of a big paradigm shift in the assumption of what a business does when it makes a sale (or invoices a B2B client, or anything transactional in nature that is conditional based on the status of the other party). What if instead of a business needing to figure out all these millions of different things themselves and reinvent a wheel that's been invented before, that information was instead stored as part of the customer? This would take the burden off the business and allow them to remain in compliance and provide better service, more accurate pricing, and not be at a competitive disadvantage. \n\n**How would that work?**\n\nRecall the situation at the beginning of this giant wall of text: Customer comes into store, picks out an item, brings it to the register, and says ""I want this delivered to my house in the next city."" This is the tricky part I have been thinking about - how can the customer's information (their address, taxable status ie wholesale/charity/tax exempt/etc) be used by a POS system to determine all of this stuff automatically so that the business doesn't have to bother with knowing anything beforehand? Existing in a smart contract that the POS would tap into, the customer's checkout is simple and quick and the business benefits because some system just managed to determine the customer's sales tax jurisdictions and add those charges to the order, then the system sets aside those funds for remittance at the end of the day (or month or quarter or whatever). This opens up new opportunities for business to improve and innovate - without these burdens they can quickly build new models that don't need six months of legwork just to handle something stupid like sales taxes.\n\nFor reference, I think our business currently has several dozen different sales tax licenses for all the cities near us. An accountant goes to each city's website and downloads their form to apply and then remits the taxes. Some cities have taxes remitted monthly. Some quarterly. Some use a PDF form. Some use a Word Doc. Some use Excel. Some accept online payments. Some require checks to be mailed. I think our state in total has 700 different sales tax jurisdictions.\n\n**Where now?**\n\nI don't really have much of anything to offer anyone. I am hoping that this post simply serves as a reminder that smart contracts can revolutionize business in ways that make the world a better place. I think that these thoughts, while focused on sales taxes, could be adapted for other situations where two parties need to make complicated agreements with each other based on the status of each.

kpxu25,1609723209,"Ever wondered why Geth nodes take so long to sync on an SSD, and why SATA vs NVMe doesn't seem to matter?","https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/18204 There's your answer. Let me break it down for you:\n\n1. User (in 2017) hates Geth sync performance and starts hacking on the code. Finds that disabling fsync makes the node sync so fast that a normal HDD can be used for syncing. (See Fsync section of this post)\n2. User creates patch.\n3. Many discussions take place about whether this is a good idea or not.\n4. One of the discussion threads is 'isn't fsync off by default?' 'yes it is' 'but when I explicitly turn it off, things go faster.' 'yea, I see that behavior too!'\n4. Charts and tests are performed to validate that explicitly disabling fsync indeed does speed up syncing.\n5. Change is ultimately rejected as (paraphrasing) 'if this should be changed, Google's leveldb team should be the one to change it'.\n\n##What the heck is Fsync?\n\nYou need to put 10 pieces of elbow macaroni into a bowl. The 10 noodles you need are already pulled out and laid on the table. There are a few ways to move them into the bowl:\n\n1. Pick each one up, one at a time, and move it to the bowl.\n2. Pick up as many as you can in small batches and drop them into the bowl in batches.\n3. Sweep your hand across the table surface and move them all into your other hand, then drop all 10 into the bowl at once.\n\nAlmost everyone will be able to do #3 faster than #1 or #2. Everyone understands that #1 is the slowest. Modern computers, by default, try to do #3 when you write anything to any form of permanent storage. They try to *buffer* the data (macaroni) into a big batch, and then flush all that data to physical media at once for efficiency reasons.\n\nFsync is a way to force the computer to take whatever data is currently in the buffer and write it physical storage **RIGHT NOW!** It would be like if you started to sweep the macaroni into your hand, but then you saw your baby was about to fall and you only had 3 noodles in your hand; you'd (in reality drop the noodles, but meh) immediately stop trying to get more noodles, and drop them into the bowl so you could go save your baby. Fsync is that request to 'stop and flush'.\n\n## Why does this matter?\nThe reason that SATA and NVMe both offer the same syncing performance (or darn near it) is because what Geth's storage backend is doing is calling fsync every single time you write to the database. They are writing to the database anywhere from 5,000 - 20,000 times per second. And that's just what they can do **with** fsync; they'd actually try to write even more often without fsync.\n\n'But my SSD can handle 50,000 IOPS!' It can, but this is different. When you call fsync(), the function doesn't return until **after** the data is 'confirmed' as flushed to storage. That confirmation takes time, on the order of milliseconds for slow SSDs, and microseconds for fast ones. If you have to wait 100 microseconds per IO to disk, then you can only write 10,000 things to disk per second if you call fsync after each write. This also explains why some people see a huge performance difference going from SATA to NVMe and others don't. If you are going from QLC NAND in a SATA drive to 2-bit NAND in a NVMe drive, then you'll see a HUGE write speed increase (from ~1ms per write to ~50 microseconds per write). You'll be able to write data a LOT faster.\n\nBut if you have two 3-bit SSDs, one SATA, one NVMe, you'll see that they both write at basically the same speed. Or if you have one SSD with 4 memory chips and another with 2, you might see the 4-chip SSD perform better than the 2 chip, because the controller (if its smart enough) can do 4 writes at once instead of 2 {2 vs 4 * however many writes the actual memory chip can handle internally}. \n\nFsync is not a bad thing, especially for a database. In fact, it's absolutely critical to good database health and performance! What is bad is that, in Geth, right now, it's being called too much.\n\n##What needs to change?\n\nThe devs need to rethink how they interact with the storage layer. Right now, today, they simply get each transaction and write it directly to DB. Which, in turn, means fsync() is called after each and every transaction written by the internal leveldb code from Google.\n\nWhat needs to happen instead is:\n\n1. They need to define and keep record of a 'checkpoint' of what data in the DB is known-good,\n2. Issue writes to the DB as they do now with fsync explicitly disabled\n3. Once an interval has passed (100tx? 10 blocks? 1 second? 10 seconds? etc; some combination of criteria) they need to call fsync() once to flush the data to the DB and ensure the data is in the DB consistently, and then a second time to update the DB with the most recently written data as the current checkpoint for 'known-good' DB content.\n4. Change the node boot code to look for this checkpoint, and roll back any DB commits that occurred after the checkpoint.\n\nWhat I am describing is exactly how transactional databases are supposed to work. I am literally describing a traditional MySQL/Oracle DB transaction. 'Start up, do some work, commit changes as a batch; roll back everything if something goes wrong'. This is a significant change for the backend because what they have right now assumes that every single write to the DB is its own transcation, and that simply doesn't scale. It didn't work in 2017, it doesn't work in 2020.\n\n[The last time](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/cwglyq/geth_performance_insights/) I wrote about Geth IO performance I was really mean, hostile, and toxic. I was so angry because I was convinced that the devs simply didn't care at worst, or were utterly incompetent at best. Neither were the case. They are totally willing to fix problems if someone is able to explain what is wrong and why. [The next release](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases?after=v1.9.6) after that post (1.9.4) actually did address the biggest issue in my post (my post = Aug 28, 2019; 1.9.4 == Sept 19, 2020), which was them writing TB of data to storage every hour. That is an incredibly fast turn around time.\n\nIf Geth were able to run at a performance level close to that of bitcoin, Monero, or other altcoin nodes, where a spinning HDD was able to run a full node, then it can only strengthen adoption of the coin because the resources to run the node and coin now scale horizontally (2 machines = 2x faster) with hardware, rather than vertically (upgrading from platinum magic to unobtainum magic in a single machine is the only way to get more fasta).\n\n## P.S. \n\nSeriously, make the leveldb files &gt; 2MB as well. Make them 400-500MB. Please. It will make things so much faster. do that and fix the over-use of fsync and you'll have a node that is near bitcoin levels of sync speed! Maybe. :p [This has been brought up before](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/15704)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kpxu25/ever_wondered_why_geth_nodes_take_so_long_to_sync/,1,27

I was emptying a wallet, and I used the 'send max' option, and I thought that was supposed apply optimal fees to move it along quickly enough. I guess not.\n\nI have no problem cancelling and upping the fees. I also have no problem waiting, b/c I am not in a rush to have this sent off. \n\nThe only thing that would bother me is if it was somehow lost. \n\nDetails below:\n\nValue:\n0.949967371624999955 Ether ($917.44)\nMax Txn Cost/Fee:\n0.00188088915 Ether ($1.82)\nGas Price:\n0.00000008956615 Ether (89.56615 Gwei)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kpynnc/trying_to_send_via_the_mew_app_and_my_transaction/,1,7
