lpu5do,1614014589,Help me understand NFT art and security of the underlying art.,"What's to stop someone from downloading a piece of art that is ostensibly ""owned"" by the holder of the token and then tokenizing that copy into a new token and selling it?  What am I missing about this? \n\nI understand the concept of authentication of ownership via the blockchain but it just seems like when it comes to an image that can be shared on Instagram it would be really simple to just copy it, tokenize it, and put it up for auction.\n\nI'm asking about this because my daughter is an artist who basically does nothing but draws all day.  I'm deciding on whether or not to introduce her to the concept of NFTs and crypto in general.   Before I do I want to make sure I completely understand how the piece is secured against forgery and copying.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lpu5do/help_me_understand_nft_art_and_security_of_the/,1,28

lpvgcj,1614017571,Question about the value of utility,"To me the value of btc makes sense. To me it's like a long term savings account, or like bullion. I never thought people would actually use it for day to day transactions. \nMy question is about ether.\n\nI get that it stores value like btc, but it also has a layer of programmable functionality on top of that. So if you want to use that functionality you need ether, and that functionality is expensive so the limited supply of ether is also expensive.. when 2.0 drops prices for network access will drop.. so etherium will be more useful, but there will be less demand for ether because the network will be cheaper? \n\nThere are many other coins and networks these days with similar functionality, so why would you build on etherium if any blockchain would do the job? \n\nBtcs value comes from it being the original, which makes sense as a store of value. While ethers value seems to come from its usefulness, what makes etherium a trillion dollar network when it's usefulness is duplicated in many other coins?\n\nThink about programing languages, C or C plus or java or whatever were never billion dollar ideas even know they are useful enough, or changed the world enough to worth big money. It just doesn't work like that. \n\nSo I was hoping someone could help me understand. Thank you so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lpvgcj/question_about_the_value_of_utility/,1,12
