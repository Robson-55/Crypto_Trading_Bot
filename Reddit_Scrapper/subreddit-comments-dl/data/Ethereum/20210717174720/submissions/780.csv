Currently (to my very basic knowledge) ENS means having to do all adjustments on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nWhat is the possibility of moving ENS onto L2, while having the information/adjustments being done on L2 count on Ethereum mainnet?\n\nObviously, I'm not sure this is a good idea, but still, having to do stuff on L1 is limiting. The problem I'm kind of sensing is that usually you ""move stuff"" from L1 to L2 and back. Here you'd have to say that ""whats real on L2 is real on L1"".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny input on this idea?

Is there a technical term for this difference?\n\nEdit: I understand that Metamask is an 'Ethereum explorer' so it would only NEED to be compatible with Ethereum blockchain, but I'm wondering what technology it is exactly that enables other wallets to be multi-blockchain-compatible.\n\nEdit 2: Or am I visualising it all wrong (I came across the statement that wallets don't actually HODL any crypto -- they technically are just keys) and actually a wallet just acts a key that various different blockchains can accept?\n\nEdit 3: It seems like e.g. Trust is actually an account that compiles a bunch of different wallet addresses and keys for different blockchains, so it's actually an aggregated wallet, not a single address that's compatible with a bunch of blockchains... So maybe i've answered my own question.
