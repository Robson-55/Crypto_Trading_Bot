ikgp1z,1598949775,"Ethereum on ARM. New Eth2.0 Raspberry Pi 4 image for joining the Medalla multi-client testnet. Step-by-step guide for installing and activating a validator (Prysm, Teku, Lighthouse and Nimbus clients included)","TL;DR: Flash your Raspberry Pi 4, plug in an ethernet cable, connect the SSD disk and power up the device to join the Eth2.0 medalla testnet.\n\nThe image takes care of all the necessary steps to join the Eth2.0 Medalla multi-client testnet \[1\], from setting up the environment and formatting the SSD disk to installing, managing and running the Eth1.0 and Eth2.0 clients.\n\nYou will only need to choose an Eth2.0 client, start the beacon chain service and activate / run the validator.\n\nNote: this is an update for our previous Raspberry Pi 4 Eth2 image \[2\] so some of the instructions are directly taken from there.\n\n# MAIN FEATURES\n\n* Based on Ubuntu 20.04 64bit.\n* Automatic USB disk partitioning and formatting\n* Adds swap memory (ZRAM kernel module + a swap file)\n* Changes the hostname to something like “ethnode-e2a3e6fe” based on MAC hash\n* Automatically syncs Eth1 Goerli  testnet (Geth)\n* Includes an APT repository for installing and upgrading Ethereum software\n* Includes 4 Eth2.0 clients\n* Includes EF eth2.0-deposit-cli tool\n* Includes 5 monitoring dashboards based on Grafana / Prometheus\n\n# SOFTWARE INCLUDED\n\n* Geth: 1.9.20 \[3\] (official binary) configured for syncing Goerli Testnets\n* Eth2.0-deposit-cli: 0.2.1 (bundled) \[4\]\n* Prysm: 1.0.0alpha24 \[5\]\n   * Beacon Chain (official binary)\n   *   Validator binary (official binary)\n* Teku: 0.12.4alpha+20200821 (compiled) \[6\]\n* Lighthouse 0.2.8 (official binary) \[7\]\n* Nimbus 0.5.0 (compiled) \[8\]\n* Grafana 7.0.4 (official package)  \[9\]\n\n# INSTALLATION GUIDE AND USAGE\n\n**RECOMMENDED HARDWARE AND SETUP**\n\n* Raspberry 4 (model B) - 4GB or 8GB (8 GB RAM highly recommended)\n* MicroSD Card (16 GB Class 10 minimum)\n* SSD USB 3.0 disk (see storage section)\n* Power supply\n* Ethernet cable\n* Port forwarding\n* A case with heatsink and fan (Optional but strongly recommended)\n* USB keyboard, Monitor and HDMI cable (micro-HDMI) (Optional)\n\n**STORAGE**\n\nYou will need an SSD to run the Ethereum clients (without an SSD drive there’s absolutely no chance of syncing the Ethereum blockchain). There are 2 options:\n\nUse an USB portable SSD disk such as the Samsung T5 Portable SSD.\n\nUse an USB 3.0 External Hard Drive Case with a SSD Disk. In our case we used a Inateck 2.5 Hard Drive Enclosure FE2011. Make sure to buy a case with an UASP compliant chip, particularly, one of these: JMicron (JMS567 or JMS578) or ASMedia (ASM1153E).\n\nIn both cases, avoid getting low quality SSD disks as it is a key component of your node and it can drastically affect the performance (and sync times). Keep in mind that you need to plug the disk to an USB 3.0 port (in blue).\n\n**IMAGE DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION**\n\n**1.- Download the image**:\n\nhttp://www.ethraspbian.com/downloads/ubuntu-20.04.1-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth2-medalla.img.zip\n\nSHA256 149cb9b020d1c49fcf75c00449c74c6f38364df1700534b5e87f970080597d87\n\n**2.- Flash the image**\n\nInsert the microSD in your Desktop / Laptop and download the file.\n\nNote: If you are not comfortable with command line or if you are running Windows, you can use Etcher \[10\]\n\nOpen a terminal and check your MicroSD device name running:\n\n`sudo fdisk -l`\n\nYou should see a device named mmcblk0 or sdd. Unzip and flash the image:\n\n`unzip ubuntu-20.04.1-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth2-medalla.img.zip`\n\n`sudo dd bs=1M if=ubuntu-20.04.1-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 conv=fdatasync status=progress`\n\n**3.- Insert de MicroSD** into the Raspberry Pi 4. Connect an Ethernet cable and attach the USB SSD disk (make sure you are using a blue port).\n\n**4.- Power on the device**\n\nThe Ubuntu OS will boot up in less than one minute but you will need to wait approximately 7-8 minutes in order to allow the script to perform the necessary tasks to install the Medalla setup (it will reboot again)\n\n**5.- Log in**\n\nYou can log in through SSH or using the console (if you have a monitor and keyboard attached)\n\n    User: ethereum\n    Password: ethereum\n\nYou will be prompted to change the password on first login, so you will need to log in twice.\n\n**6.- Forward 30303** port in your router (both UDP and TCP). If you don’t know how to do this, google “port forwarding” followed by your router model. You will need to open additional ports as well depending on the Eth2.0 client you’ve chosen.\n\n**7.- Getting console output**\n\nYou can see what’s happening in the background by typing:\n\n`sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog`\n\n**8.- Grafana Dashboards**\n\nThere are 5 Grafana dashboards available to monitor the Medalla node (see section “Grafana Dashboards” below).\n\n# The Medalla Eth2.0 multi-client testnet\n\nMedalla is the official Eth2.0 multi-client testnet  according to the latest official specification for Eth2.0, the v0.12.2 \[11\] release (which is aimed to be the final) \[12\].\n\nIn order to run a Medalla Eth 2.0 node you will need 3 components:\n\n* An Eth1.0 node running the Goerli testnet in sync \[13\]. Geth in our case.\n* An Eth2.0 Beacon Chain connected to the Eth1.0 node. You will need to choose a client here (Prysm, Lighthouse, Teku or Nimbus)\n* An Eth2.0 Validator connected to the Beacon Chain (same client as the Beacon Chain)\n\nThe image takes care of the Eth1.0 setup. So, once flashed (and after a first reboot), Geth (Eth1.0 client) starts to sync the Goerli testnet.\n\nFollow these steps to enable your Eth2.0 Ethereum node:\n\n**CREATE THE VALIDATOR KEYS AND MAKE THE DEPOSIT**\n\nWe need to get 32 Goerli ETH (fake ETH) ir order to make the deposit in the Eth2.0 contract and run the validator. The easiest way of getting ETH is by joining Prysm Discord's channel.\n\nOpen Metamask \[14\], select the Goerli Network (top of the window) and copy your ETH Address. Go to:\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/YMVYzv6\n\nAnd open the “request-goerli-eth” channel (on the left)\n\nType:\n\n`!send $YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS (replace it with the one copied on Metamask)`\n\nYou will receive enough ETH to run 1 validator.\n\nNow it is time to create your validator keys and the deposit information. For your convenience we’ve packaged the official Eth2 launchpad tool \[4\]. Go to the EF Eth2.0 launchpad site:\n\n[https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/)\n\nAnd click “Get started”\n\nRead and accept all warnings. In the next screen, select 1 validator and go to your Raspberry Pi console. Under the ethereum account run:\n\n`cd &amp;&amp; deposit --num_validators 1 --chain medalla`\n\nChoose your mnemonic language and type a password for keeping your keys safe. Write down your mnemonic password, press any key and type it again as requested.\n\nNow you have 2 Json files under the validator\_keys directory. A deposit data file for sending the 32 ETH along with your validator public key to the Eth1 chain (goerli testnet) and a keystore file with your validator keys.\n\nBack to the Launchpad website, check ""I am keeping my keys safe and have written down my mnemonic phrase"" and click ""Continue"".\n\nIt is time to send the 32 ETH deposit to the Eth1 chain. You need the deposit file (located in your Raspberry Pi). You can, either copy and paste the file content and save it as a new file in your desktop or copy the file from the Raspberry to your desktop through SSH.\n\n**1.- Copy and paste:** Connected through SSH to your Raspberry Pi, type:\n\n`cat validator_keys/deposit_data-$FILE-ID.json (replace $FILE-ID with yours)`\n\nCopy the content (the text in square brackets), go back to your desktop, paste it into your favourite editor and save it as a json file. \n\n**Or**\n\n**2.- Ssh:** From your desktop, copy the file:\n\n`scp ethereum@$YOUR_RASPBERRYPI_IP:/home/ethereum/validator_keys/deposit_data-$FILE_ID.json /tmp`\n\nReplace the variables with your data. This will copy the file to your desktop /tmp directory.\n\n**Upload the deposit file**\n\nNow, back to the Launchpad website, upload the deposit\_data file and select Metamask, click continue and check all warnings. Continue and click “Initiate the Transaction”. Confirm the transaction in Metamask and wait for the confirmation (a notification will pop up shortly).\n\nThe Beacon Chain (which is connected to the Eth1 chain) will detect this deposit (that includes the validator public key) and the Validator will be enabled.\n\nCongrats!, you just started your validator activation process.\n\n**CHOOSE AN ETH2.0 CLIENT**\n\nTime to choose your Eth2.0 client. We encourage you to run Lighthouse, Teku or Nimbus as Prysm is the most used client by far and diversity is key to achieve a resilient and healthy Eth2.0 network.\n\nOnce you have decided which client to run (as said, try to run one with low network usage), you need to set up the clients and start both, the beacon chain and the validator. \n\nThese are the instructions for enabling each client (Remember, choose just one Eth2.0 client out of 4):\n\n**LIGHTHOUSE ETH2.0 CLIENT**\n\n**1.- Port forwarding**\n\nYou need to open the 9000 port in your router (both UDP and TCP)\n\n**2.- Start the beacon chain**\n\nUnder the ethereum account, run:\n\n`sudo systemctl enable lighthouse-beacon`\n\n`sudo systemctl start lighthouse-beacon`\n\n**3.- Start de validator**\n\nWe need to import the validator keys. Run under the ethereum account:\n\n`lighthouse account validator import --directory=/home/ethereum/validator_keys`\n\nThen, type your previously defined password and run:\n\n`sudo systemctl enable lighthouse-validator`\n\n`sudo systemctl start lighthouse-validator`\n\nThe Lighthouse beacon chain and validator are now enabled\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PRYSM ETH2.0 CLIENT**\n\n**1.- Port forwarding**\n\nYou need to open the 13000 and 12000 ports in your router (both UDP and TCP)\n\n**2.- Start the beacon chain**\n\nUnder the ethereum account, run:\n\n`sudo systemctl enable prysm-beacon`\n\n`sudo systemctl start prysm-beacon`\n\n**3.- Start de validator**\n\nWe need to import the validator keys. Run under the ethereum account:\n\n`validator accounts-v2 import --keys-dir=/home/ethereum/validator_keys`\n\nAccept the default wallet path and enter a password for your wallet. Now enter the password previously defined.\n\nLastly, set up your password and start the client:\n\n`echo ""$YOUR_PASSWORD"" &gt; /home/ethereum/validator_keys/prysm-password.txt`\n\n`sudo systemctl enable prysm-validator`\n\n`sudo systemctl start prysm-validator`\n\nThe Prysm beacon chain and the validator are now enabled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TEKU ETH2.0 CLIENT**\n\n**1.- Port forwarding**\n\nYou need to open the 9151 port (both UDP and TCP)\n\n**2.- Start the Beacon Chain and the Validator**\n\nUnder the Ethereum account, check the name of your keystore file:\n\n`ls /home/ethereum/validator_keys/keystore*`\n\nSet the keystore file name in the teku config file (replace the $KEYSTORE\_FILE variable with the file listed above)\n\n`sudo sed -i 's/changeme/$KEYSTORE_FILE/' /etc/ethereum/teku.conf`\n\nSet the password previously entered:\n\n`echo ""yourpassword"" &gt; validator_keys/teku-password.txt`\n\nStart the beacon chain and the validator:\n\n`sudo systemctl enable teku`\n\n`sudo systemctl start teku`\n\nThe Teku beacon chain and validator are now enabled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NIMBUS ETH2.0 CLIENT**\n\n**1.- Port forwarding**\n\nYou need to open the 19000 port (both UDP and TCP)\n\n**2.- Start the Beacon Chain and the Validator**\n\nWe need to import the validator keys. Run under the ethereum account:\n\n`beacon_node deposits import /home/ethereum/validator_keys --data-dir=/home/ethereum/.nimbus --log-file=/home/ethereum/.nimbus/nimbus.log`\n\nEnter the password previously defined and run:\n\n`sudo systemctl enable nimbus`\n\n`sudo systemctl start nimbus`\n\nThe Nimbus beacon chain and validator are now enabled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT's NEXT**\n\nNow you need to wait for the Eth1 blockchain and the beacon chain to get synced.  In a few hours the validator will get enabled and put into a queue. These are the validator status that you will see until its final activation:\n\n* UNKNOWN STATUS\n* DEPOSITED (the beacon chain detected the 32 ETH deposit with your validator public key)\n* PENDING (you are in a queue for being activated)\n* ACTIVATED\n\nFinally, it will get activated and the staking process will start.\n\nCongratulations!, you join the Medalla Eth2.0 multiclient testnet!\n\n# Grafana Dashboards\n\nWe configured 5 Grafana Dashboards to let users monitor both Eth1.0 and Eth2.0 clients. To access the dashboards just open your browser and type your Raspberry IP followed by the 3000 port:\n\n    http://replace_with_your_IP:3000\n    user: admin\n    passwd: ethereum\n\nThere are 5 dashboards available:\n\n* Geth Goerli: Eth1.0 node status\n* Prysm: Eth2.0 client status\n* Lighthouse: Eth2.0 client status\n* Teku: Eth2.0 client status\n* Nimbus: Eth2.0 client status\n* Ethereum on ARM node: Raspberry Pi board Status\n\nLots of info here. You can see for example if Geth is in sync by checking (in the Blockchain section) if Headers, Receipts and Blocks fields are aligned or find Eth2.0 chain info.\n\n# Updating the software\n\nWe will be keeping the Eth2.0 clients updated through Debian packages in order to keep up with the testnet progress. Basically, you need to update the repo and install the packages through the apt command. For instance, in order to update all packages you would run:\n\n`sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install geth teku nimbus prysm-beacon prysm-validator lighthouse-beacon lighthouse-validator`\n\nPlease follow us on Twitter in order to get regular updates and install instructions.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/EthereumOnARM\n\n# References\n\n1.
