It’s worth like 3240 right now, if i stake right now will my investments stick at that price or will the price change as the value of the coin changes even after it’s been staked?

Additionally, you can see what other people write about a specific crypto asset.\n\nWe have just built that, so we would love to get some feedback on the idea and feature suggestions.\n\nOn the landing page is a limited example of what you could do with the app.\n\nLink: https://www.coinnotes.io/\n\n\nIt is free to use for everyone :)\n\nThanks a lot for any suggestions",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nenuwb/we_have_built_a_tool_that_allows_you_to_take/,1,3

nepr2c,1621280535,The Dao hack and is Blockchain really safe?,"So I just watched a documentary about Ethereum where they talked about the Dao hack. I'm curious about the time vitalik called for the hard fork which actually rewrote the code, this makes it possible that Blockchain is technology that can be altered and isn't some sort of tech that cannot be tampered with if ever the owners decided that it was something they wanted to do. I just never saw it that way, because that's how many people make it out to be.\n\n How can we be so sure that individual companies using blockchain tech in the future do not misuse or manipulate the tech? Can we really put so much faith into our privacy and data being secure when at the end of the day we still rely on whichever company/provider it is that provides us a particular service, even though the tech they're using is Blockchain. \n\nMaybe I'm missing things here. But I feel like just because the tech has all the pros, it does not mean it is free from being manipulated by the companies that use it to sell us their services and products. So where lies the decentralisation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nepr2c/the_dao_hack_and_is_blockchain_really_safe/,1,19
