mwmoij,1619149899,Seriously can't believe how slow implementation is taking to lower gas fees. It's disgusting and disgraceful.,"Where is poster child Vitalik these days? Sure seems awfully quiet while the majority of the crypto community screams foul and protests in disgust over the ever increasing ethereum networks gas fees. \n\nAlmost 150 USD at time of writing. One. Hundred. And. Fifty. Dollars..... Is this some kind of cruel joke? I have to literally spend almost 3% to trade some tokens. Was this seriously never thought out at the time of ethereums creation? It makes no sense to me that ANY of the original developers thought of, or hand the hindsight, to mitigate these types of fees with a largely used and adopted network. Did they all think eth wouldn't catch on? Wouldn't see as much use? Wouldn't have nearly the amount of usage? Seems like some pretty piss poor planning IMHO. \n\nWhat else did they unforsee? And why the hell is it taking them so long to implement a solution? It's been what, two years? With another two year potential before any of these fees are mitigated and or have some sort of palpable solution? Sorry for venting, but ethereum is the one of the largest reasons why our beloved ecosystem is being held back, and progression is being grinded to a halt. All cylinders where firing at maximum speed.... And then eth just had to throw its shitty wrench into the engine bay. I mean.... For christ sakes, when Binance produces a solution that blows ethereum out of the water, its incredibly sad and disgraceful at this point in time. Centralized or not, ethereum needs to get its shit together. I love this chain, but how long can you love something that doesn't love you back? \n\nRant over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mwmoij/seriously_cant_believe_how_slow_implementation_is/,1,13

mwnx8j,1619154585,Are gas fees high because miners are utilising Flashbots to take advantage of MEV by exploiting Mempool sequences? THE AMOUNT OF FLASHBOTS ON ETHEREUM IS BECOMING MAINSTREAM?,"Miners Extractable Value becoming a big part of the network:\n\n\n\nArbitrage hopefuls are scanning the eth Mempool\n\n\n\nOnce multiple entity try to outbid each other, the miners benefit\n\n\n\nMiners are becoming frontrunners as they can sequence transactions\n\n\n\nThis is called MEV (Miner Extractable Value.)\n\n\n\nImportantly, the Optimism system enables the capture and repurposing of MEV.\n\n\n\nBy splitting the sequencers (auctioning the right to become a sequencer to the free market) and validators (whom validate transactions and add to Optimism Layer 2) The right to capture MEV is then auctioned off, creating an equitable cycle.\n\n\n\nJust as frontrunners attempted to outbid each otherâ€™s transactions to capture MEV, those who wish to capture MEVA are forced to bid for the right to sequence transactions, and ultimately hands this value off to the auctioneer. That auctioneer is Optimism, and the Optimism team intends to enable the redirecting of this captured value to parties that were never going to be able to access it in the first place, but arguably should have: The developers who built the contracts in the first place!\n\n\n\nFlashbots is an R&amp;D organization working on mitigating the negative externalities of Ethereum MEV. Today 5 mining pools are running its MEV-geth software, which in total account for &gt;12% of the Ethereum hashrate. Miners running MEV-geth have seen an average increase in income of 0.13 ETH per block so far in March, which is also a ~3x increase MoM. In total, miners collected 174 ETH in Flashbots fees in February, up by more than 6x the amount collected in January.""\n\n\n\nA recent study that aimed to quantify the so-called miner-extractable value (MEV) in Ethereum in the last 6 months shed some light on the scale of bot activity in Ethereum. The study found that bots extracted 0.34 ETH of MEV per block through arbitrage and liquidations. Moreover, the study found that 18.7% of MEV extracted by bots is paid to miners through gas fees which makes up 3.7% of all transaction fees. Undoubtedly, this implies that the scale of bot activity on Ethereum is becoming mainstream. To provide comprehensive front-running protection, bloXroute introduced a private transactions service, in collaboration with a group of mining pools.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mwnx8j/are_gas_fees_high_because_miners_are_utilising/,1,1

My questions are:\n\nDoes any of this even apply to me for how simple a position I'm in? Like say for arguments' sake I'm only interested in ever holding my current investment in the currency for the growth value to pull out a few years, can I simply hold this for the mid to long term or do I myself need to migrate over to ETL eventually? Will the service I use probably do this for me? Does ETH itself become useless 5+ years from now?
