jhaaus,1603551460,Two minute elevator pitch for Ethereum,"I'm trying to come up with a 2 minute elevator pitch for Ethereum. \nAs more and more people start hearing about Ethereum it's important that they get an overall idea so that they can at least make some what of an educated decision on whether this space interests them or not.\n\nWhat I am looking for is a high level definition and then some real world tangible examples. \n\nHere is my go -\n\nThe big idea of ethereum is smart contracts.\nEssentially, you have an account and another party also has an account. But the account is whats called a smart contract. It is open source code which can be verified by anyone.\n\nIf you send 1 eth to the contract, then, the contract will execute some instruction.\n\nThis is a 10000 foot view but you can imagine the following applications:\nBanking - I send 10 eth and I get $1000 (basic loan without a bank). Your 10 eth is locked as collateral.\n\nInsurance - smart contracts are connected to the real world so, if there is a hurricane in Miami, then, the smart contracts will execute and automatically pay out people.\n\n\nYou remember all those lovely bailouts??\nImagine if you had smart contracts tied with the real world with automatic payouts to different corporations and since everything is recorded in the blockchain, you can see exactly where the money goes and how it's being used.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jhaaus/two_minute_elevator_pitch_for_ethereum/,1,20
