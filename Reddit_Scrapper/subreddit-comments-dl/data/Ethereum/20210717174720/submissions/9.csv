Gnosis Protocol’s permissionless architecture enables anyone to list new option series. \n* **Batch auctions:** Gnosis Protocol’s underlying trading mechanism, batch auctions, enables liquidity to be shared amongst all assets listed on the protocol. It doesn’t limit liquidity to single token pairs. \n* **No slippage**: As long as there is sell liquidity for any oToken, it’s guaranteed that you won’t get a worse price than your limit price.\n\n**Links:** \n\n* [Mesa](https://mesadev.eth.link/#/trade/DAI-0x7cac16770dd5f2a59859a395a492224f05a846b6) trading dapp built on Gnosis Protocol\n* [Etherscan](https://docs.gnosis.io/protocol/docs/tutorial-limit-orders/) instructions\n* [Opyn](https://opyn.co/)\n* [Gnosis Protocol](https://docs.gnosis.io/protocol) introduction\n   * [Announcing Gnosis Protocol](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-the-gnosis-protocol-89b3d7794da7) post\n\nJoin our team and community for further discussion about Opyn on the Gnosis Discord at [http://chat.gnosis.io](http://chat.gnosis.io/).",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/gofdco/trade_opyn_options_on_gnosis_protocol_dex/,1,6
