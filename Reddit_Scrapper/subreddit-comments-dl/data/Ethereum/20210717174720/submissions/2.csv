gkmlar,1589594905,Is a gas free implementation possible? Newbie wants proof of work but hold on proof of value,"I'm a newbie so let me know if I should ask on another sub. I want to use smart contract in an enterprise setting. I want certain actions completed and derived assets to be traceable and forkable over time but not carry a transaction fee. This is because I don't know the value of that work yet. I would ideally like to issue a token that is later priced over a time period into stablecoin and fiat or perhaps even equity. The value of that token at each transaction can then change between free, stablecoin/fiat or exchanged services.

gl1yoa,1589661661,Proposal: a DAO to refund users that sent Ether to wrong addresses by 1-2 digits.,"## The checksum problem\n\nAs early Ethereum proponents, it is our responsibility to find flaws in the technology and work towards solutions. I feel like sometimes this community is very eager to solve the hardest mathematical problems, yet ignores the simplest, essential human issues surrounding the usability of our tech. One of those issues is the way we deal with wrong addresses. \n\nSince Ethereum addresses aren't check-summed at protocol level, that means that if you accidentally change one digit, you will send your Ether to a completely inaccessible address and lose it forever. Since every address on the 160-bit space is valid, there is nothing that can be done at the protocol level, and it is too late (essentially impossible) to change it at this point. The accepted solution is, thus, to embed checksums on the representation of an address via uppercases. Clever, but it relies on wallets doing the right thing. Reality is most apps and exchanges still give you lowercase addresses and wallets don't enforce the checksummed format (some don't even check when available).\n\nThis isn't a small inconvenience, it is a huge usability flaw that can be life-changing. Twitter user [EthLost](https://twitter.com/EthLost) has sent 40 ETH to an 1-digit off address, money that was very important to him, and claims he can barely sleep. Sure, it was his fault to put money he wasn't willing to lose in an experimental technology, but do we want Ethereum to be labeled as experimental forever? ~~Bitcoin got it right from the beginning, so this is inexcusable.~~ We can't just sit and expect people to start using Ethereum if we never care about our users, real people, and how they're being affected by it. I'd like to urge devs to stop using lowercase addresses, but, since we can't rely on that, I'd like to also make a mitigating proposal.\n\n## A proposed DAO to mitigate the issue\n\nMy proposal is that we make a DAO to refund users that accidentally sent their Ether to the wrong address by 1-2 digits. That DAO would be just a simple smart-contract deployed on main-net. We'd then voluntarily deposit a small part of or our holdings there and I truly hope we have enough kind people around to have sufficient funds there. Then, if any Ethereum user - including yourself - ever sends his money to the wrong address by 1-2 digits, he/she would be able to withdraw from the contract's balance by calling `refund_me(wrong_address)`. The contract would simply check that `wrong_address` differs from `address.sender` by only 1-2 digits (which is an evidence of the mistake) and would send a percentage (75%?) of the lost money (i.e., `wrong_address`'s balance) to `address.sender`. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile this isn't an ultimate solution, it is what can be done at this point. It is, again, almost impossible to change the protocol at this point, but, at a small cost for everyone, we can help EthLost and others that have their lives negatively affected by this issue, which is arguably your own fault. What do you think? Do you agree this problem must be mitigated? Would you be willing to contribute with such a DAO?
