More so of a, ""this shit gonna get lit one day"", type of mentally where I throw 10% every month of all gross earnings between me and the spouse. Never missed a beat. So totally, we have $120k+ invested in crypto over the years. Real question is, what do I do with the ethereum? I could stake? I could host?

nwcwi0,1623292300,Local fullnode is one block behind,"I just created a local Binance Smart Chain fullnode on my PC with the following specs:  \n\nOS: Linux running on Windows Subsystem for Linux  \n\nStorage: 1TB SSD (Samsung 980 Pro)  \n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800x  \n\nRam: 32GB  \n\nInternet speed: 940 mbps up/down fiber  \n\nI set up the fullnode late last night and was surprised to see that it was synced within about 14 hours. I verified that it was synced by using \`eth.syncing\` in the \`geth\` console, checked the output of my logs, and verified that I was pulling the most recent block by using \`web3.eth.get\_block('latest')\` from the Python \`Web3.py\` library while connected to localhost. However, I was doing some testing and noticed that sometimes \`web3.eth.get\_block('latest')\` from [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/) was pulling later blocks than my local fullnode.  \n\nFor example, these commands were run in succession:\n\n    # connected to https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/\n    In: web3_bsc.eth.get_block('latest')['number']\n    Out: 8079724\n    # connected to local fullnode\n    In: web3_local.eth.get_block('latest')['number']\n    Out: 8079723\n    # connected to https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/\n    In: web3_bsc.eth.get_block('latest')['number']\n    Out: 8079724\n\nHow is my local fullnode behind [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/)?
