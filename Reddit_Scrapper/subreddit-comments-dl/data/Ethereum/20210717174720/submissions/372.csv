lh8mvk,1613004219,[Question] How do smart contracts get verified with physical goods?,"I've been reading up on it, but don't really understand it.\n\nHere's an example I found on some website:\n\n\n&gt; **Let’s imagine that John wants to buy Mike’s house. This agreement is formed on the Ethereum blockchain using a smart contract. This smart contract contains an agreement between John and Mike.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the simplest terms, the agreement will look like this: “WHEN John pays Mike 300 Ether, THEN John will receive ownership of the house”.**\n\nhow does this even get verified? You can't put a physical item on the blockchain. Even if it's a secret password to unlock some vault to get the deed to the house, what's to prevent somebody from promising a bad key on the contract or not even having the deed in the vault?\n\nFor example:\n\n1. I pretend you can have my house and write the contract that if you give me $500 worth of ETH you can have it\n2. Second person puts $500 into the smart contract\n3. Second person clicks buttons saying ""OK I put in 200 and verify there's a house that OP put up"". I click button saying ""OK sure I put up a house, whatever""\n4. Smart contract completes, other guy is screwed out of $500 because I'm not giving him my house, I just lied\n\nEven if this happens, crypto isn't currently something that would hold up in a court of law right? And the lawyer fees to go through this kind of mess would be dumb to even do in the first place. What am I missing here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lh8mvk/question_how_do_smart_contracts_get_verified_with/,2,25

lh9xyv,1613008226,Proposal for a better side bar,"Hello everyone,\n\nAs someone who has and continues to recognized the immense possibilities of Ethereum, ETH, and the future of the internet, the more I recognize the need for an ""all-in-one"" center of information for people of all disciplines and walks of life, to educate themselves on the multi-disciplinary world that is Ethereum and Crypto.\n\nEthereum.org is an excellent place to start, and is FULL of educational content, but much of the info on the site requires the reader to continue their education elsewhere. This requires more time, effort, and the possibility of digesting biased and bad information. What I am proposing is an ongoing, workable, list of resources, that cover everything from ""Ethereum Basics"" to advanced topics on coding, philosophy, and economics.\n\nIf we are going to push this technology forward and change the world (as is the mission), we need a library of resources that can help all backgrounds catch up and achieve whatever it is their goals are in this space. We also need this information to be easily accessible and user friendly. This information should be organized much like a college course, prospectus and all. Gate-keeping should not be tolerated. We should encourage all backgrounds and levels of education to get involved.\n\nAdmittedly, I am writing to you after my 3rd beer, so these thoughts may come off as jumbled, unorganized, and inarticulate, but my hope is to start a conversation on how we can make the mission of Ethereum, the economics of Ethereum, and the technical aspects of Ethereum more accessible to a broad audience.\n\nAnd i think we start with an improved side-bar where users can easily learn everything from the most basic to the most complex. Thank you for reading, lets start a convo and continue to improve the future for everyone.\n\nTLDR; let’s work together to make a better sidebar for the noob to the PhD",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lh9xyv/proposal_for_a_better_side_bar/,9,8
