l0vcyd,1611096390,Thinking about getting an Avado node???!," \n\nHello, \n\nI recently came across this Avado node blockchain computer that makes running a node or 2 super easy. Which has me interested. I like the idea of running a node on a smaller project that can really use my help and support get decentralized, and also the idea of potentially earning money doing so doesnt hurt. ( Any one know aprox what you can earn, I'm not thinking 1000's of dollars. the website says $25 a month roughly want to see if thats accurate. \n\nAnyways if anyone has thoughts or experience with this please let me know",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l0vcyd/thinking_about_getting_an_avado_node/,2,15

l0x1tw,1611101523,Thoughts on Ethereum’s culture,"I was initially disappointed to find that Ethereum’s community and culture seems to be far less energetic and active than Bitcoin’s. However, I think this is actually indicative of the power of Ethereum. Bitcoin, having little-to-no utility (which is perfectly okay), has to build extremely strong narratives to keep the perceived value high. Ethereum on the other hand, doesn’t need these narratives because of the utility of the chain. Both are fine approaches, but when someone sees that there are less Ethereum memes and the price is still going up, they should see it as a positive sign of Ethereum’s utility. \n\nMaybe you can tell a token’s level of utility by the non-correlation between its price and the number of memes about it. \n\nJust some thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l0x1tw/thoughts_on_ethereums_culture/,2,50

l0xvxy,1611104136,"ETH is going up, so why are gas prices not going down?","Considered relative to some arbitrary fiat currency, take USD for example, ETH has doubled in value recently.  If everybody keeps paying the same gas fees, that means the miners are getting twice the USD in transaction fees as before.  Shouldn't they be accepting lower gas fees?  And yet gas fees have gone up?  That makes no sense.

Is there some committee that's just deciding the interest rate like a central bank?\n\nI understand how PoW blockchain rewards work, you get the block reward because you insert it there as the successful miner of a block.
