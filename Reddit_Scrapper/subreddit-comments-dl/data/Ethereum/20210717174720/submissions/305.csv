kx6zo5,1610635636,How to buy Ethereum with Euros?,"Etheruem, also known as Ether - is the second largest cryptocurrency based on market cap. Now that's quite a statement.  \n\n\nYou thinking of entering cryptoâ€™s second largest market? So was I - I searched for a bit but here is a good article that helped me to learn how to buy Ethereum with Euros: [tap.global/how-to-buy-ethereum-with-euros](http://tap.global/how-to-buy-ethereum-with-euros)  \n\n\nWhere and how do you buy your Etheruem?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kx6zo5/how_to_buy_ethereum_with_euros/,1,1

kx7h73,1610637132,A side chain for trusted debate (Vitalikâ€™s Mentality),"Vitalik Buterin once said that he wished that all parties of a debate should be trusted by signature and mathematical proof.\n\nVitalik was unable to solve this riddle. I did. From scratch, I fully developed the smart contracted needed to pull off this feat (apart from the audits as this is yet to unfold) as a beta side chain that validates trust on the parties that with to parley amongst themselves. Alongside this it is useful for things such as raw theory.\n\nThe side chain theory is tricky:\n\n-	We need to guarantee that debate participants will live to be 200 years old as the first 100 years are required for fraud verification on scientific proof. Because we cannot probe theory to be correct we need to wait an appropriate amount of time to optimistically guarantee this (we should shorten the period if more debatists get bred.)\n-	My swing o meter shows that if debates go too much away from the person who is wrong then we will a) lose the theory, and b) need recovery steps from an oracle. To achieve this we need to debate ourselves in the future to guarantee oracle participation.\n-	By far the most difficult quorum is that debates need participates who are versed in scripture and in law, and without this the Ethereum oracle can not resolve\n-	Without many debate participants we risk falling below the threshold. Please see my curve analysis for this as it should explain everything.\n-	Right now you will find only donations through time and money will be accepted. We are grouping together to be stronger and we will it accept anything beyond your time and money as this is the fairest way to ensure finality.\n\nSo to summarise. This means that debates with many participants can happen on the blockchain, and guaranteed by the oracle. There is no lore reason for TV debate!! This is trust indivisible. No need for politicians. We can spread their salaries.\n\nAs stated. This is ready to go. I need exactly 3200 hours of human life to achieve through debate. Thanks to the self sustained ProofOfDebate engine the first 3200 hours will be enough to sustain the system for over 200 years. This is Vitaliks Mindset. (There is a go fund me also to prove how fucking trash this sub is)\n\n3200 hours and we can sustain argument forever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kx7h73/a_side_chain_for_trusted_debate_vitaliks_mentality/,1,0

The transaction fee proposed in Ledger Live shows about $3.80 for ""fastest"". This seems very low considering the fees lately so I wanted to seek more understanding before telling her to go for it as I don't want to advise her to go and then find the transaction gets stuck because she should have paid more.

Even though you have different kinds of token built on the platform, at the end of the day, they all share one single ethereum blockchain that stores all transactions? Right?\n\n2. As a miner can I select the token's I want to mine for? Let's say I want to participate on the ethereum network as a miner, can I say, as an example, I am only interested in  mining transactions that emanates from cryptokitties?\n\nThanks! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kx9tzm/couple_of_questions_about_mining_and_dapps_on/,1,3
