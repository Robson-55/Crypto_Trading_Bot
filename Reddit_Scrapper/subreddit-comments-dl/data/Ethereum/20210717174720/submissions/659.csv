nb4xie,1620868872,Accepting Memecoin Members With Open Arms,"I've seen a lot of vile, disgusting behavior towards those that are hurting because of the memecoin crash. I'd like to just remind the crypto community, well those of us that have been at it for a while, that we were in their shoes. Remember how people treated you when you were trying to explain crypto for the first time. Most of us were called fools that were buying into an obvious scam.\n\nSounds similar right. So no matter what you feel about these things, for a lot of new comers, this was very real to them. Most of the people I've spoken to were hoping to hold while looking at a 3-5 year horizon. Their hearts were in the right place and they were investing in communities that made them feel like they were wanted. \n\nContrast that to what I've been seeing today and ask yourself, would you want to learn more about ETH and crypto in general if you were being called a dumb degenerate gambler who's worthless? \n\nA lot of these people were just doing their best and making good faith investments to the best of their ability. And the stories I've seen - people had managed to find hope in this current world. They felt like they had some power. \n\nMaybe this is my big short moment, but realize that for some people, this meant a hell of a lot. And their looking for ways to make sure it can't happen again. So they're coming here and being mocked in their hour of panic instead of being educated and welcomed. \n\nIt's disgusting elitist behavior. Is that really what the crypto community is about? Is that really what this community is about.

nb5n47,1620871050,Is Ethereum going to continue to rise at the rate it is now?,"I got into Dogecoin back when it was like 7 cents with a 2.4k investment (roughly in dollars, I'm british). It was a knee jerk thing and I had no idea what I was doing. Now, after learning slowly over the past month how the market works, I've decided I'm kind of tired of Doge's volatility. This might be salt on the missed opportunity to bail out before SNL and buy back in for profit (scum move, I think?) tbf. \n\nAnyway, I was looking at Eth, and I notice it's a steady increase except for a heavy dip earlier today, and of course the crash that just happened. I'm confident Doge will also start a steady climb in a week or so, but like I said, I'm tired of the volatility. \n\nCan anyone explain the state of Ethereum to me? Is it worth hopping and why?
