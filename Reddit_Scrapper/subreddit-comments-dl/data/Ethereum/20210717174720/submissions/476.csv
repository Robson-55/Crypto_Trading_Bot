meuwot,1616907620,What's the difference between attestation and finality?,"When describing attestation, the ethereum.org website says:\n\n""If a validator isn't chosen to propose a new shard block, they'll have to attest to another validator's proposal and confirm that everything looks as it should. It's the attestation that is recorded in the beacon chain, rather than the transaction itself.\n\nAt least 128 validators are required to attest to each shard block ‚Äì this is known as a ""committee"".""\n\nWhen describing finality it says:\n\n""In distributed networks, a transaction has ""finality"" when it's part of a block that can't change.\n\nTo do this in proof-of-stake, Casper, a finality protocol, gets validators to agree on the state of a block at certain checkpoints. So long as 2/3 of the validators agree, the block is finalised. Validators will lose their entire stake if they try and revert this later on via a 51% attack.""\n\nWhat is the difference between the two? Is it that attestation is done on the shard chain level (attesting to a shard block) and that finality is done at the global block level, coordinated by the beacon chain?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/meuwot/whats_the_difference_between_attestation_and/,1,0

I got a bit confused with hard forks (HF), especially with respect to the upcoming Berlin HF and later London HFs.\n\nIn the past, whenever a HF occured and a network branched into two, there were also two coins associated. The main branch and coin continues to work without any interaction by the user. however, if an address contained coins at the time of the fork, the holder can claim the equivalent amount of coins on the second branch, like for ETC or BCH.\n\nWill this also be the case for the upcoming ETH forks?
