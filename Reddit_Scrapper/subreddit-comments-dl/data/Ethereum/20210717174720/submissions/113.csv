ibdk4j,1597668737,lowering the block reward,"If we cut the block reward to say 1.85 ETH soon, this should almost guarantee a price increase for ETH. Why? Because the fees are insanely massive right now. \n\nWhich means lots and lots of people are trying to use the chain. To make transaction you gotta pay fees in ETH. So people buy more ETH to help cover the fees for all that mad yield farming. So this should actually make mining more profitable, not less.\n\nCause miners are loading up on these fees, if they hold something like 20% of those rewards and this block reward cut happens, then they will make so much money from just saving some of this money for fees that normally you wouldn't be making anyways.  \n\nI am pretty confident most miners are holding onto some % anyways, so they can get 32 eth for staking in the future. \n\nEIP 1559 seems like it won't be in the next fork.
