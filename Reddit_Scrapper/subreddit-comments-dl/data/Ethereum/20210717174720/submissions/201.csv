jrokm3,1605027298,Any Idea of how to get involved without coding?,"As many of the Ethereum-fans I am intrigued by the Blockchain-technology! First step forward surely would be to get involved... but I am not a coder. I know how to code in Python but I wouldn't call myself a good coder, I simply don't spend too much time with it, and it isn't my primary wish to learn javascript and solidity. \n\nI am trying to push the topic on my university and coming from economics I have written essays and works on the applications of Blockchain-Tech that would fill several Bachelor-Theses. But I wan't to be within the system, actually experiencing live whatever is developing and innovating around Blockchain-Tech and its non-Currency/Trading implications. So here to my question:\n\nDoes anybody know whether it is possible for someone like me to be useful within the Blockchain-Ecosystem and get on the forefront and if so where, or if I am best helping with spreading awareness for it and staying an attentive observer?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jrokm3/any_idea_of_how_to_get_involved_without_coding/,1,1
