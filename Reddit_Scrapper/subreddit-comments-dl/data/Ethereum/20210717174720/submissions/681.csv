I recently signed up to Coinbase and Coinbase Pro and I'm liking the Pro version more because I enjoy in-depth, intricate data and such. But I heard that they have high fees? I'm not too knowledgeable about fees in crypto. I was also going to sign up for Binance or [Binance.us](https://binance.us/) but I don't want to continuously sign up and enter my information over and over again until I find the right one. I may want to mine this as well late in the future. I also want to be able to actually own the damn coin unlike in Robinhood where they own the coin and you're just in their wallet.
