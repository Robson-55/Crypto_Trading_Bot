n2dr27,1619855258,"Ethereum in uptrend still, the sky is the limit","# ETH closes the month above record all-time high of $2,800+\n\n[Ethereum in uptrend still, the sky is the limit - DecentraNews](https://decentra.news/ethereum-in-uptrend-still-the-sky-is-the-limit/)  \n\n\n The price of¬†ETH¬†is surging again this May 1st; reaching above the $2,860 mark for the first time, according to TradingView charts. Ethereum gained over 190% since the start of 2021 and is 1,200% higher than at the same date last year. Ethereum is ranked at a solid 2nd in terms of total crypto market capitalization. Compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum continues to be undervalued. But it‚Äôs slowly catching up on the BTC/ETH charts.   \n\n\n### If you want a low-risk strategy to capitalize on Ethereum, here‚Äôs my suggestion.\n\nAim for longer-term gains. [Learn about dollar-cost averaging and other strategies](https://decentra.news/the-only-trading-tips-you-will-ever-need/). Buy a little, whenever you have some money to spare, that you can afford to lose, every week or every few weeks.
