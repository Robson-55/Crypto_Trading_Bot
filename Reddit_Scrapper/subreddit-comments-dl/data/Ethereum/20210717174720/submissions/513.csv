I know there are multisig wallets (e.g. Argent) but from my layman understanding this is usually for security reasons s.t. more than one signature is required for the approval of a transaction. I might be wrong, though.\n\nIdeally it would have some kind of governance that can approve or revoke permissions l but that's a ""nice to have"". For now it's ok, it just everyone has access.\n\nI'm tired of managing the funds of my (amateur) band alone just because banks generally don't offer accounts for more than one or two people. ;-)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mndh7e/wallet_for_multiple_people/,1,8

mne55r,1617963535,Fundamental thoughts on Bitcoin vs Ethereum: 2 advantages that gold has over silver but Bitcoin doesn't have over Ethereum,"**1.) Better stock-to-flow**\n\nGold has a better stock-to-flow ratio than silver. The stock-to-flow ratio is the very basic metric to judge if something is a good store-of-value or not, and silver is just worse than gold. This is not the case for Ethereum. It already has a similar stock-to-flow ratio like Bitcoin, but with the upgrade EIP-1559, which burns network fees, Ethereum will be even better than Bitcoin with regard to stock-to-flow.\n\n**2.) Physical advantages**\n\nGold has physical advantages over silver: \n\n* It is harder to fake because its density is \~2x higher\n* It is more durable because it doesn't tarnish and it is more scratch-resistant\n* It is smaller and lighter and therefore easier to store and transport\n\nBitcoin doesn't have the same advantages over Ethereum. Yes, Bitcoin has proven safety, but this advantage will go away over time, contrary to the physical advantages of gold vs silver, which are here to stay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:** Don't expect Bitcoin vs Ethereum to play out like gold vs silver. Bitcoin just doesn't have fundamental advantages over Ethereum like gold has over silver.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mne55r/fundamental_thoughts_on_bitcoin_vs_ethereum_2/,1,4

mnhpxz,1617976504,"Rant: Thought I was late to the Crypto Game, but realized I am way too early","As my title states, I thought I was too late for the Crypto world. But after my experience with Ethereum realized that Crypto is still in infancy mode.\n\nAll I wanted to do was to buy some Altcoin I heard about. I am posting this in r/ethereum as this is what caused most of my expensive pain...although this can relate to most of Crypto\n\nI'm gonna say this now because I know some guy is going to blame this on user error and stick side with the platform. In product development whether software, hardware, or physical product. It is never the user's fault. It is always the products fault. If a user makes an error, it is because the product was designed poorly. If designed well, the user would have never made that mistake.\n\n**Background:** I'm a guy that played with Crypto 3 years ago and got back into it.\n\n1. Wanted to buy some Altcoin and first problem was trying to find the a the proper Exchange that I could trade on (US problems) with the Altcoin.\n2. That was Crypto.com and Uniswap\n3. Funds Tied up\n   1. Gemini because Approved Addresses take a week\n   2. Kraken, they don't have ACH. So really have to plan out each Fiat Deposit because of Wire Fee\n   3. Crypto.com has Credit/Debit, but nearly all cards reject Crypto stuff. ACH on the way, but that takes forever (Altcoin has already pumped...)\n4. So I take whatever Fiat I have in Kraken to buy USDT because I thought it would just be more convenient to see Altcoin to dollar than ETH to Altcoin. Honestly can't make out if I'm profiting if its Crypto to Crypto\n5. I got USDT and withdraw to my Hardware wallet through Meta Mask on UniSwap\n6. I had some ETH luckily on my Hardware Wallet to Approve on UniSwap, but not enough to Swap. Already paid approval fee... Oh and really high Liquidation Fee. This took forever to get approved. \n7. Had to sell off my DOT on Kraken for ETH. Withdraw that to my Hardware Wallet to fund the UniSwap transaction\n8. Unfortunately closed out original approved tab on UniSwap. So now I still have USDT from before because I was stuck on Approval. I noticed before that Uniswap was switching to ETH in between anyways. (USDT &gt; ETH &gt; Altcoin). So I'm like ok I will just switch USDT to ETH this time. Another high Gas fee...\n9. Then Switch ETH to my Altcoin. High Gas fee again. Finally!!! done also creating multiple taxable events when I didn't need to.\n10. One mistake here and there. $35+ fee each time. My Banks $20 wire fee. Kraken Withdrawal fees. Liquidation Fees. I have lost of $150 on this ordeal. Had lots more problems, but am trying to keep it brief.\n11. If I have type in one more Authentication code, I'm gonna lose it.\n\nTLDR; Crypto has a long wayyyyyys to go guys.

I know the change to Eth2 is supposed to start soon, but I’m a little confused about Eth2’s listing on Kucoin (not sure if other exchanges have it as well). If the change hasn’t happened yet, how do they have 2.0 listed? Is it legit? Is it a preemptive thing where they’ll automatically change to “real” Eth2 when the change eventually happens? I thought it was supposed to take about a year and a half to rollout. I am confusion.\n\nI swapped my Eth for Eth2 on Kucoin and am receiving staking rewards for it in the form of Eth2. Just wondering if anyone had any info on its legitimacy or how it works. Thanks ahead of time!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mnibnq/question_about_eth2_on_kucoin/,1,6
