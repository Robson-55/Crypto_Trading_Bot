n7i9zf,1620452046,Atomic wallet stuck transaction,"Hi,\n\nI am a bit unsure of what to do. I sent my ETH from Atomic wallet to a new one, however, I set the gas price way to low and now the transaction is stuck. \n\nAfter doing some research, it seems I can overwrite the transaction using the nonce? Yet, I am completely lost on how to do this when using Atomic (compared to Metamask etc.)\n\nAny help would be appreciated! üëç",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n7i9zf/atomic_wallet_stuck_transaction/,1,17
