mhiqvr,1617234081,ASIC miners + 1559 + quick PoS... Potential problem?,"Disclaimer: I'm just a guy who mines with my 3080 on my computer that I bought for gaming/school. Using the cash to help me pay off my college tuition. I don't really care about mining profits reducing because once it isn't profitable anymore I'll just continue to use my computer as I always have. \n\nSo I've been a little bit concerned with the changes that will happen to Ethereum in the next year. I think that they are all a step in the right direction, but due to them all occuring so close to eachother I believe this could have the potential for disaster. Here's why: \n\n* **ASIC miners coming online**: this isn't a problem on its own, but just keep this in mind for now. Some of the most efficient ASICs Eth has ever seen are coming online and are increasing network difficulty significantly. These are centralized mostly in China (see: Bitcoin), and estimates state they could currently represent anywhere from 10-40% of current network hashrate. \n\n* **EIP 1559**: Again, I think this is a great idea and a needed UX change for ETH. However, with ASICs coming online and increased difficulty, I fear this will kick many GPU miners off of the network. This is because ASIC miners cannot switch off the network, and they are also very power efficient and pay very little for power.  Personally I think that by August/September, GPU mining will not be profitable anymore. \n\n* **PoS merge**: this could happen as early as October from what I have heard. Again, I think this is a great and necessary change. However, I believe that there is very high chance that by October, ASIC miners will comprise 60%+ of the network hashrate based on these two reasons alone. **I do not think they will take the merge with open arms**. You are talking about people who invested hundreds of thousands of dollars on massive ASIC farms that will be left useless after the merge to PoS. They have no resell value and cannot be used to mine anything else. By the time the merge occurs, they might not have made back their initial investment, and will be hoping to secure their profits at all costs. I think a 51% attack from ASIC miners is very likely to occur by the time of the merge. \n\nIf Eth shoots up to like double or more of what it is today, GPU miners will stay on and this is less likely to happen, but I wouldn't count on it. There are very simple things we can do to avoid this but it needs to be done sooner rather than later. I'm not asking for a delayed merge or to stop EIP-1559. I want both of those to happen. I'm asking that the community considers an implementation of ASIC resistance to help prevent an attack on the network. \n\nI'm open to any discussion and counterargument. These are just my thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mhiqvr/asic_miners_1559_quick_pos_potential_problem/,1,7

mhj9tu,1617235849,"“Patsy attacks”, a possible IRL exploit against blockchain tech","Hypothetically: would it be possible for malicious actors to enter data into the ethereum blockchain (or another blockchain) with the intention inciting hostile action against the blockchain by government actors?\n\nLet’s say that a bad actor input data into the blockchain that, when unzipped by a highly popular and available compression software, was converted into something illegal (use your imagination)\n\nIn this scenario, the illegal data would be publicly visible on the blockchain and it would be impossible to remove without destroying the blockchain itself, if such a thing is possible. The unzipping software could not be made illegal, and there would be no way to “black out” or even obscure the compressed data on the blockchain. This would incite law enforcement and regulators to attack the blockchain, like some kind of maliciously incited autoimmune disease.\n\nI thought that the term “patsy attack” was an interesting label (if there isn’t one already) because it basically allows hostile entities to weaponize the police as a weapon. \n\nSo is such a thing possible?

mhoz7a,1617257251,"Opinion: Time to sunset the ""Ethereum 2.0"" branding (and just call then ""Ethereum upgrades""?)","I'm sure we've all heard ""Ethereum 2.0 / ETH2.0 is years away"", ""ETH 2.0 is Ethereum's last shot at lowering gas fees"", ""Competitors are delivering ETH2.0 features today"", ""Eth 2.0 is the next version of Ethereum"", ""Ethereum 2.0 is a new chain that will replace the current chain and lead to massive headaches for developers and users"", so on and so forth. Of course, none of this is true, but understandable given the misleading Ethereum 2.0 branding. Danny Ryan has spoken about this vocally, and we've seen EF researchers start calling what was eth1 and eth2 application-layer and consensus-layer respectively. While this is an elegant and accurate nomenclature for developers, researchers and enthusiasts, it's still confusing to the average user and investor. \n\nNow, I don't quite grasp the black magic that is marketing, so perhaps some of you will have a better suggestion. What we want to do is shift the narrative and just consider all of it one Ethereum, with no ""next version"". Instead, we have an incremental set of upgrades that are rolling out regularly in the next 2-3 years. \n\nArguably, the significant upgrades coming in the foreseeable future to Ethereum are rollups, EIP-1559, The Merge, data sharding, and statelessness; with several minor upgrades. As an example, even a ""minor"" application-layer upgrade like EIP-2929 will potentially enable a small bump in the gas limit, and thus have a greater direct impact on L1 gas than the major big upcoming consensus-layer upgrades - proof-of-stake and data sharding. \n\nIt shouldn't matter to the average user which layer of Ethereum is upgraded - only that Ethereum is being upgraded frequently and what each upgrades do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mhoz7a/opinion_time_to_sunset_the_ethereum_20_branding/,1,22
