la9oym,1612202876,Accessing my Ethereum Wallet,"Hi, about 4 years ago I had Ethereum Wallet, and several Ethereum stored in it, working fine on my PC. I have let it go since then, and haven't launched the wallet program for years, but when I went back to launch it and just see how my Ethereum is doing, the wallet program first prompted me to download a new version, and now that new version is just spinning forever and not launching. After searching online, it seems others had this problem, and Ethereum Wallet has been discontinued? So how do I access my money? Can someone please help me (using simple language please)? I want to access my Ethereum, which to my knowledge is all backed up somewhere on my PC, but I don't know how.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/la9oym/accessing_my_ethereum_wallet/,5,15

laaf27,1612204612,Anyone else encountered this problem? (Help out an ETH Noob),"Hi Guys, I'm new to ETH and I buy it to protect my money against devaluation, because my country's currency loses value everyday. So ETH is like a safe haven for my money and protects it from losing value.\n\nHowever recently I encountered a problem, I bought ~0.12 ETH from a platform and then I transferred it to my Blockchain wallet, but I noticed it did not come into my Blockchain wallet, then I knew something was wrong.\n\nI went for transaction hash/receipt; that receipt states that the transfer was a ""success"", and states that I sent ~0.12 ETH from the sending address to my Blockchain address (Receiving Address) but it also shows that the value transferred is 0 ETHER !\n\nAnd I'm charged a transfer fee of ~ 0.001 ETH which it states clearly.\n\nThis has made me sad for days as I'm confused and I feel scammed.\n\nWhat could be wrong? And how do I get my ETH back because 0.12ETH is big money where I come from.\n\nHas anyone one else experienced this, and what did you do to resolve it?\n\nThanks.\n\nEDIT: ""The platform"" I bought from is a startup named ""BuyCoins "", they are actually reputable in my part of the world. And I have done numerous transactions using their platforms and this is the first time I'm getting problems.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/laaf27/anyone_else_encountered_this_problem_help_out_an/,3,4

laau0b,1612205605,Best practice for selling digital music / physicals directly artist-to-fan,"Hello /eth,\n\nI took part of a PHD research project which was exploring the use of Ethereum as a way for artists retain a larger share of their revenue by selling directly peer-to-peer\*, having performed at the first ever blockchain ticketed live stream event in 2019.\n\nI'm looking for any information / pointers in how to improve / create a webstore to sell music / digital art / physicals (vinyl) direct to fans. I want to make the transition from major stores / major streaming platforms to a direct fan-to-artist system inbuilt to our website (www.squarms.co.uk).\n\nThe system currently set up uses metamask ([https://www.kanedarecords.com/squarmssheleftthetvon](https://www.kanedarecords.com/squarmssheleftthetvon)) and is somewhat clunky and less user friendly than i imagine it could be.\n\nAre there any projects out exploring this further, or do you have any suggestions on how to improve this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso; is creating an ERC-20 token for an individual artist plausible? (for the purpose using it to buy music from said artist / invest in said artist / explore new possible artist-fan engagement routes).\n\nLastly - NTF‚Äôs - selling physicals - would the intrinsic price of an NTF go up in tandem with the price of Eth? Could the value of a tape or vinyl increase in value over time through a platform like Opeasea? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts or pointers would be great,\n\nThanks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*[https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/paypal-for-punks-opensource-money-for-diy-music-d9021ffe9ec](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/paypal-for-punks-opensource-money-for-diy-music-d9021ffe9ec)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/laau0b/best_practice_for_selling_digital_music_physicals/,11,15
