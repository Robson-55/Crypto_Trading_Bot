hn1yoz,1594152280,HOW ARE WE: A quarantine performance art piece that lives on Mainnet Ethereum,"HOW ARE WE is a collectively-created performance consisting of fifteen 90-second solos made in quarantined isolation during the first wave of Covid-19 in May of 2020.\n\nThe video file was hashed, and its metadata was stored on IPFS and minted into an ERC-721. Per a binding legal contract, whoever owns that ERC-721 owns the rights to the video. If MOMA ever wants to buy the piece, they'll now need to obtain an Ethereum Wallet.\n\nWe also created ERC-20 tokens for the contributors to the project- the artists, programmers, writers, and lawyer. If the piece is sold, holders of the ERC-20 split the proceeds evenly based on their token holdings. Each additional time it is sold, 10% of the new sale price goes back to the original artists. Unlike traditional art, if the value goes up after its first sold, the original creators continue to benefit. All fan donations sent to 0x8d8029ccfe7027f81c6b698605b3ea3fc01bb743 will be distributed directly to these token holders regardless of who currently owns the 721.\n\nFull explanation here: [https://howarewe.xyz/critical-texts/#mbrs](https://howarewe.xyz/critical-texts/#mbrs)\n\nView the artwork here: [https://howarewe.xyz/watch-the-video](https://howarewe.xyz/watch-the-video)\n\nExplore the Contract here: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d8029ccfe7027f81c6b698605b3ea3fc01bb743#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d8029ccfe7027f81c6b698605b3ea3fc01bb743#code)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hn1yoz/how_are_we_a_quarantine_performance_art_piece/,1,6
