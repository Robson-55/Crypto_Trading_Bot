n49yr3,1620082938,My Soulcraft,"Sometimes art is hard. I often travel as far as Iceland from California, work with art models which have very high rates, step them through shoots which are for both of us ~ stressful, painful, deeply emotional, and often risky shoots. I bring thousands of dollars in very heavy camera gear on my own back to rugged locations, and capture honest art. \n\nIt‚Äôs not an 8bit pixel drawing of doge or a spinning cube rendered in c4D... it‚Äôs a legit journey and a labor of love that takes weeks to prepare for, thousands to set up, and a pivotal split second to capture. Even more time to develop and edit upon my return. Sometimes I don‚Äôt get the shot. Sometimes I spend thousands on travel only to be ghosted or the model isn‚Äôt in her element. The internet continues to censor my work which is not sexual, and merely a harmless celebration of the beauty of nature and the feminine. \n\nIt would mean the world to me if you dropped me a like or follow, shared my work, or lent some encouragement. \n\nMy work is available at https://foundation.app/soulcraft and others are minted on https://rarible.com/soulcraft \n\nDepending on the piece, owners will receive a signed, AR integrated print of the artwork from my international award winning photography collection. The final purchase of any multi-mint series will receive my upcoming book, Alchemy of Alignment.\n\nMy book features the last 3 years of my fine art photography, captured in the frozen landscapes of Iceland, lush forests of Maui and Mexico, to the martian wastelands of Utah and beyond - Alchemy of Alignment - Kickstarter.com/projects/Soulcraft/Alchemy-of-Alignment",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n49yr3/my_soulcraft/,1,0

n4a7g5,1620083639,Ethereum 2.0 Questions,"So the biggest question is when will Ethereum 2.0 going to be fully released? I am not really worried about putting a 5 figure sum into staking. My issue is how long will this Ethereum be locked up for? I'm just thinking for worst case scenario and I need to become liquid fairly quickly. I've heard late 2021 and 2022 but with no more specificity. Has anyone heard anything more specific?\n\nMy second question is in regards to staking rewards. Do the rewards compound? Meaning, that the rewarded ETH added to your total means you get a slightly bigger reward next time based on the APR? Or are you only rewarded based on the initial amount of ETH you have staked? How does this change if you don't have enough ETH to be a sole validator or you're staking on an exchange?\n\nThanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n4a7g5/ethereum_20_questions/,1,11

n4b4yd,1620086442,Upside/Downside of ETH2 staking (and APR) over traditional savings,"I'd be interested in hearing the perspective of others regarding the upside or downside of putting a significant amount of my savings into ETH2 staking and earning 6% APR as opposed to leaving it in a traditional savings account.\n\nI currently have a traditional online savings account where I've parked enough money to give me roughly 1 year's worth of savings. I'm currently earning .5% interest (down from 2.5% when I signed up thanks to the pandemic and falling interest rates).\n\nRecently, I started dollar-cost-averaging into Ethereum and was then given the chance to stake my ETH in ETH2 through Coinbase.  I'm getting 6% APR at the moment which is obviously a ton better than my savings account.  I'm fortunate to have a very stable job where I'm not in any jeopardy of getting laid off/fired and I don't have any plans that I would need a significant amount of money for in the next 6-9 months.\n\nI'm also a believer that the price of ETH is going to continue to rise, especially when the new protocol upgrades and EIP 1559 are released.\n\nSo, I'd like to hear some perspective from others in terms of the upside/downside of staking some portion of savings in ETH2 in order to benefit from the increased interest rate and the overall rise (hopeful... of course this is not guaranteed) in ETH. What are the downsides to doing this (such as not being able to use the funds until ETH2 is released, potential fall in the price of ETH, etc)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n4b4yd/upsidedownside_of_eth2_staking_and_apr_over/,1,33
