kolman,1609543375,Eth Stolen - Don't be like me,"Today, January 1st at 6:19:12 AM Central Time (11 hours ago as of the writing of this post), my ethereum wallet was emptied of it's balance of 4.10 Eth\n\nHere is the transaction ID: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf01967ce5ce8ba048530f0e0c37cfd01466b05e416a82a1afe9af39151bc4e35\n\nI feel like I am going to vomit, my stomach is deep pit.\n\nIs there anything I can do?!\n\n\nBackground:\nI am new to this community, not being much of a redditor either. When I made this wallet it was my first venture into crypto, I was just a kid.\n\nI mined some eth, and built a small balance, things happened and I stopped focusing on crypto for a while. A few months ago, my interest was sparked once again, and I purchased a ledger and decided to finally secure my crypto, pulling my balances of exchanges. I had to stop at the wallet.\n\nI was just a kid, and didn't understand the importance of security or organization, so my password was not very secure, and I had forgotten it.\n\nResults:\nFor the past month I've been working off and on to guess my password, today I finally managed, however 10 hours too late. This just feels so awful and unlucky, 10 hours! 10 hours could have made all the difference! Instead I've just lost nearly all my crypto, and even worse, on the first day of a new year. I would be laughing if it wasn't so awful, because for this to happen today, almost feels poetic. Why not yesterday? Or a year ago? This just feels like a bad dream.\n\nThis is worse than just losing a few thousand dollars, it is a portion of childhood, and lately I've been really happy with where eth is going and now it turns out my seat on the wagon was an ejection seat this whole time, and it went off just as things could have turned around.\n\nTLDR: unsecure childhood eth account is emptied just at the beginning of a new year, and I was 10 hours too late to save it.\n\nWhat can I do? The cops can't help?! Is there any chance I can recover it?\n\nI'm panicking.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kolman/eth_stolen_dont_be_like_me/,1,83
