ngf6ug,1621453691,ETH short ladders?,"CC isn't bombing because people are selling, it's bombing because of short attacks. This morning the price dropped from 2300 to 1800, check your candles, I may be wrong. I don't know if I've ever seen that kind of a sell off in just a 7 minutes though. \n\nMy guess, rising inflation and interest rates are driving this bear market to spill over into CC unlike anything before.

I took a look on a nanominer log and i discovered that gpu power consumption felt from 118w to 76w just like that. Plugging cable back in causes power jump back to higher Watts. Monitor was connected to PS4 at a time. So why that happens? Where is almost 40w?
