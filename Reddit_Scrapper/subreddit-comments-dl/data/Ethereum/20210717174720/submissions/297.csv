kunasm,1610313652,Should I cash out?,"Hi Everyone,\n\nI bought some Ethereum on Coinbase on the 25-12-2017. I am a total dummy when it comes to crypto currency and just bought it due to some information from a friend about it and thought it sounded good. I bought £75 worth and this quickly dropped in value staying at around £30 for a few years. I didn’t want to cash out as I thought I may as well play the long game. I very rarely check the Coinbase account so to my surprise checking it this evening the shares have shot up and now my wallet is worth £120.26. \n\nI am just looking for some advice, should I keep this money in there or take it whilst I can? Do people think it will continue to rise in value or not? \n\nThanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kunasm/should_i_cash_out/,0,13

kunof9,1610314725,"Looking for help with testing a fun, open source Ethereum Dapp","Hey there. My name is [Dan](https://github.com/basicallydan) and I've recently decided to try my hand at writing a simple smart contract using Solidity with a lovely little UI written in JS + HTML.\n\nI'm a big fan of smooth launches, even for the smallest and simplest of applications, and so I'm looking for 1-10 volunteers to help me test out this app. It would help if you:\n\n1. Have used Metamask/Brave's integrated wallet extension before\n2. Have interacted with a Dapp on the [Rinkeby Test Network](https://www.rinkeby.io/#stats) before\n\nNo experience writing smart contracts is necessary but if you happen to have experience and would like to absolutely tear my code to pieces you are very welcome.\n\n**All you would need to do is make a few transactions with a ""fake"" wallet on Rinkeby and tell me how it went :)**\n\nIt's *exceedingly simple* and I don't intend to put it on the main Ethereum network because it's far too intensive to be worth anybody's hard-earned ETH, but it's a really nice tech demo.\n\nAs far as compensation is concerned all I can offer is good vibes knowing you've helped out an open-source project, and a mention on the web page and GitHub repo.\n\nThanks!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kunof9/looking_for_help_with_testing_a_fun_open_source/,2,8

kup9u2,1610319354,"Got £10K in ETH, do I trade it all for BTC?","Yo guys, just another noob riding this bull.\n\nMy thought process is that if I can buy and own 10is full ETHs, currently valued at around £950 ($1278) a piece, would it be worth transferring it all to BTC (sitting at £27k)? I'm not sure if owning a fraction of a BTC is more or less beneficial than owning 10 entire ETHs. \n\nAm I mistaken for thinking that owning an entire token gets you more gains than owning a fraction of another, even with the same 'monetary' value? (In my case, GoodBoyPoints.)\n\nSorry if this is a bad question, but I'm confused. \n\nThank you in advance for any advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kup9u2/got_10k_in_eth_do_i_trade_it_all_for_btc/,0,14
