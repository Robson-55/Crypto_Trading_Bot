j8gjhw,1602316134,Ethereum 2.0: is another delay looming?,"&gt;The team around Vitalik is working 24/7 on Ethereum 2.0, an important upgrade that will decisively advance the Ethereum blockchain. The pressure on the Ethereum developers is increasing after the blockchain had reached the limits of its resilience in the past few weeks due to the Defi boom.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The fee situation improved somewhat in October, right now the average transaction fees on Ethereum (ETH) are around 2 US dollars (image above), but the cumulative transaction fees that users have paid to Ethereum miners in 2020 so far, reached more than $ 350 million, more than twice as much as Bitcoin miners made in 2020 (approx. $ 155 million).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As you can see from the graphic above, the Ethereum miners really got it off this year, but the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Spadina-Testnet leaves a lot of open questions**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Actually, the dress rehearsal of Ethereum 2.0 was supposed to start with the Spadina-Testnet and prove that the improved blockchain is already ready for use on the main-net. But Ethereum 2.0 coordinator Danny Ryan then had to admit several problems (peering etc.), which ultimately led to a failure by Spadina.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the meantime, the errors have been corrected and next Monday, October 12th, a second attempt with the Zinken Testnet is to start. If this second test then goes well for the developers, Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 could come to the main-net in November.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, if errors also occur in the Zinken test-net, there is a risk of a renewed delay in Ethereum 2.0, which should actually come to the main-net in July.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Ethereum 2.0 with 100,000 TX / s in phase 1**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So far, Ethereum (ETH) could only handle around 15 transactions per second (TX/s) on the base layer, but even with the switch to Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0, the blockchain on the base layer will not scale particularly and that for years, admits Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. This scaling will only come with the final phase of Ethereum 2.0, which is still years away, according to Buterin.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Therefore, Ethereum 2.0 will initially focus on rollups, plasma, and state channels. In addition, there are a number of Layer 2 solutions that are about to be introduced (Optimism, Fuel, Arbitrum, and OMG Network). Other solutions are already activated on the main-net. These include Loopring, ZKsync, and DeversiFi.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Vitalik Buterin, therefore, hopes that as many developers and users as possible will switch to rollups. This would raise the throughput to around 3,000 transactions per second (TX/s). In phase 1 with sharding, up to 100,000 Tx/s should then be possible later.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Summary**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anyone who hoped that Ethereum 2.0 would solve all scaling problems immediately should be disappointed. Ethereum 2.0 is an important step forward (PoS-Proof of Stake Consensus), but the Ethereum team will initially rely on 2-layer solutions such as rollups in order to scale.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Rollups have the advantage that the state of the blockchain is recorded off-chain. In addition, nodes (miners) and users only have to provide data in an orderly manner, but do NOT process any transactions. In principle, rollups separate data availability from data processing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It would be important for the further scaling of Ethereum (ETH) if Layer 2 protocols are also integrated into wallets such as MetaMask. The bottom line is that investors shouldnâ€™t expect too much from Ethereum Phase 0. It will probably take a little longer for Ethereum to scale properly.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TA (Technical analysis):  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ethereum (ETH) has stabilized at the $ 330 level for the time being and is moving towards the 50-day line that runs at $ 370. The trend-following indicator signals a further upward movement, but the consolidation, which began at the beginning of September, is not yet over.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This means:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In order for there to be further upside potential, Ethereum (ETH) would have to break the 50-day line and close above the $ 400 mark on a weekly basis.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Good luck with your financial decisions &amp; have a good weekend\n\nsource:[medium](https://medium.com/@cryptoeinfach/ethereum-price-prediction-2020-3c7f6b047dd6) (metered paywall)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/j8gjhw/ethereum_20_is_another_delay_looming/,1,26
