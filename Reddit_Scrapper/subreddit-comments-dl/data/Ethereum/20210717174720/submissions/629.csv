n81ei7,1620517050,"This is a casino, sir. Not a financial institution.","I’m really just a fan boy for Ethereum, but even this is risky. I don’t want to see anyone making bad financial decisions. But personally I’m planning on ETH blowing up to like 50k in next 3-5 years. It seems very possible, but not guaranteed. Also if your just investing now, you will not get rich over night. It’s not a good way to think, realize you get yourself in trouble thinking like that. When investing you need a clear concise safe decision making mindset. Because even owning crypto is a risk, let alone staking, lending, transferring. This thing is still in development. Imagine it as an online casino, go ahead ask on all the subs and speak to the “experts”, that claim they know what’s going to happen next. But also, their are nice people here that do give good advice and tips. Also watch out for scammers they lurk these pages. The truth is no one knows. The one of the few only experts on this earth is Vitalik. And I doubt he’s dropping any knowledge here anytime soon. Be careful and don’t move on impulse but with knowledge and full understanding of what you are doing.
