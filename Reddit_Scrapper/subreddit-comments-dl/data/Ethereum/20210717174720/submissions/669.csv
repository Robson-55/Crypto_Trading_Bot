What are the projections?\n\nElon Musk‚Äôs recent deactivation of Bitcoin payments due to environmental concerns is a point that ETH holders should use to promote ETH as Ethereum has got lower TWh than Bitcoin does. And, if Ethereum 2.0‚Äôs TWh is dramatically lower than Bitcoin‚Äôs (114 TWh per year), it‚Äôs a no-brainer for Tesla to incorporate ETH payments. \n\nCurrently, Ethereum‚Äôs TWh is 44 per year.
