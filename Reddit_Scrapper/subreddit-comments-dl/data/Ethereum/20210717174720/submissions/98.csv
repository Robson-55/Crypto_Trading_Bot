i3yltr,1596600984,How can I deposit ETH to someone without interaction?,"The title sucks - I know, so let me explain what I'm trying to do...\n\nI have two nieces that are graduating and going off to college. I want to get them both something that would be useful for them in the future but not a cheesy graduation gift like they're probably going to get.\n\nI want to do two things:\n\n1.) Buy them both a Ledger Nano S and have them set it up and understand it for themselves \n\n2.) Once they've set up their Ledger Nano S I somehow want them to have funds, specifically, I'd like to send them a little ETH. How can I do that without them asking for it? Is it possible to set up some sort of Smart Contract or a Wallet so that when they scan it, they're deposited funds? If so, how could I do that securely so that only the two of them could receive it? \n\nI don't want to pre-load the Ledger Nano S because I want them to practice good habits, so they should set up it up and know how the seed phrase works, etc. \n\nAny thoughts on how I could achieve this? Any/All help is greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/i3yltr/how_can_i_deposit_eth_to_someone_without/,1,26
