k5es8u,1606932912,zk-Rollups Questions,"I have been for some time now reading about the so called layer 2 solutions, and in particular, the zk-Rollups. After using some of the projects that implement this technology, I'm amazed by how fast and cheap the transactions are, but I have some technical questions that hope someone can clarify:\n\n* How can zk-Rollups achieve that almost instant speed? I know how Bitcoin/Ethereum blockchain works, and that its speed is limited because different nodes have to talk to each other and reach consensus, which in a decentralised network takes some time. If this happens instantly in rollups like Loopring, how is this achieved? Are there some kind of nodes in l2? Can I run one? How decentralised they are? I have the feeling that things in l2 are a bit obscure and not as transparent as in l1. How is the architecture of a l2 zk-rollup?\n* Some rollups like Loopring claim to be able to process around 2500 transactions per second. If we create 1000 different rollups like Loopring on l2, does this mean that we can achieve  2500 \* 1000 transactions per second in the network? Of course the bottleneck here is the current l1, and I guess this will depend on how often l2 settles the data in l1, but just wondering the parameters that can be tuned for this.\n\nCheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/k5es8u/zkrollups_questions/,1,5
