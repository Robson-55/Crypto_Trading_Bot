ndkiav,1621156807,Isnt PoS a self-reinforcing pattern?,"My question is simple. As I understand it, owning more ether means miners are awarded more ether right? So doesn't that mean the biggest players will acquire the most coins? To me that seems more risky not less. \n\nA quick thought experiment. There are 3 people in the world and persons A &amp; B each have 1 coin for a total of 2. Then there is person C who has 2 coins. Doesnt that mean that person C will accrue more coins over time, at a faster, compounding, rate? Play this out long enough and doesnt person C have all of the power &amp; influence in regards to the ledger?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ndkiav/isnt_pos_a_selfreinforcing_pattern/,1,38

ndkmw9,1621157374,When would be the time to migrate to L2,"Hi,\n\nwith L1 gas prices rising and not being expected to fall any time in the near future I really wonder at what point one should jump ship and get off L1.\n2 months ago I've moved a small amount of ETH onto ZkSync which cost about 40$ even back then, I probably wouldn't have done it under the current circumstances. But then again it has to be done at some point as I don't see myself paying 100$ for a TX and yet onboarding onto L2 looks like it might that expensive since I would have to move all my assets into one wallet first and then pay for the L2 contract gas. \n\nSo I'm curious to hear what everybody's thoughts are on this issue are and maybe which L2 would be the best safe haven for now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ndkmw9/when_would_be_the_time_to_migrate_to_l2/,1,8
