mm6347,1617813298,Bit of a noob question regarding gas.,"Hi all, I've got a small amount (~0.1ETH) sitting in a wallet that I'd like to send to my Binance account. Now, I've read that simple transfers usually only take around 21,000 gas to send, give or take a little. However, transfers to ""smart contract addresses"" can use in excess of 800,000 gas! I guess I have two main questions:\n\n1) What is a ""smart contract"" address, and how does it differ from a regular wallet?\n\n2) Is Binance considered a ""smart contract"" exchange, and will I be slammed in gas fees for sending my ETH there?\n\nThanks in advance for any help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mm6347/bit_of_a_noob_question_regarding_gas/,1,5

mm7q0n,1617817791,Cannot transfer ERC 721 token in MetaMask in dev environment.,"Experienced developer here, trying my hand at figuring out Ethereum development.\n\nMy problem is if I connect MetaMask to my local Ganache instance, I can't transfer my DOG token from one account to the other. I can transfer my test ETH, but when I try to transfer DOG it gives me this infamous error: `VM Exception while processing transaction: revert`\n\nI made a contract as so:\n\n    pragma solidity ^0.6.2;\n    \n    import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/presets/ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoId.sol"";\n    \n    contract DogCard is ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoId {\n      constructor()\n        public\n        ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoId(\n          ""Dog Cards"",\n          ""DOG"",\n          ""https://dogcardcrypto.com/token/""\n        )\n      {}\n    }\n\nIt works fine using truffle tests. Here's a passing test:\n\n    contract(""DogCard"", accounts =&gt; {\n      it(""Works?"", async function() {\n        const dog_card = await DogCard.deployed();\n        const [owner, sender, receiver, randomguy] = accounts;\n        let contract = new web3.eth.Contract(dog_card.abi, dog_card.address);\n    \n        // Balance goes from 0 to 1 after minting token.\n        assert.equal(await dog_card.balanceOf(receiver), 0);\n        let coin = await dog_card.mint(receiver);\n        assert.equal(await dog_card.balanceOf(receiver), 1);\n    \n        // Using web3, transfer new token.\n        let tokenId = 0;\n        transfer = await contract.methods.safeTransferFrom(receiver, randomguy, tokenId).send({\n          from: receiver,\n          gas: 133520\n        });\n        // Verify the balances are correct.\n        assert.equal(await dog_card.balanceOf(randomguy), 1);\n        assert.equal(await dog_card.balanceOf(receiver), 0);\n      });\n    });\n\nAs ambiguous as my issue is, does anyone know why I can't transfer the token in MetaMask? I have 100 ETH in the test account. It's not a gas issue as far as I can tell. I can mint a token to my test account and see it inside MetaMask after I add the contract address, but I get an error when attempting to transfer. What gives?
