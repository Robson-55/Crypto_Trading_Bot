jrrjy5,1605036212,Why no stakers and how to fix it.,"This post is **not** about trading.\n\nIf you sold in 2013 peak, you would 10x your holding.\n\nIf you sold in 2017 peak, you would 10x your holding. \n\nBut you probably didn't. You still have a chance, probably the last one, to sell at 2021(22?) peak.\n\n**But if you stake, you will lose this last chance!** If the prices peak before 1.5 is released, you can't sell! If you've lost your last chance to 10x your capital, mere 20% is not much of consolation. That's why people are hesitant to stake.\n\nFortunately, it's fixable. The bull run will probably last for a year. It's long enough warning. Developers just have to prepare plan B: a two-way bridge or any other emergency escape hatch and release it when bull run is confirmed. **If developers publicly commit to it**, people won't be afraid to stake and 2.0 will release on time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jrrjy5/why_no_stakers_and_how_to_fix_it/,1,22
