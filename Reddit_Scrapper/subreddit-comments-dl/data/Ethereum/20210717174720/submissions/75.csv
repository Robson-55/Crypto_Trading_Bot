hu3gq1,1595176848,ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard updated to mention the Diamond Standard for contract upgrades,"Today the [ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) was updated to mention [EIP-2535, the Diamond Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535), for contract upgrades.\n\nPreviously ERC-1155 mentioned [EIP-1538](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1538) for upgrades. But EIP-1538 has been replaced by the Diamond Standard, which is why ERC-1155 was updated. The pull request is here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2800\n\nERC-1155 [says this](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#upgrades):\n&gt;To alleviate the need to emit events when changing contract address, consider using the proxy pattern, such as described in EIP-2535. This will also have the added benefit of providing a stable contract address for users.\n\n### About the Diamond Standard\n\nConsider using the Diamond Standard for contract upgrades, to solve the maximum contract size limit and for code organization.\n\n&gt; A diamond is a set of contracts that can access the same storage variables and share the same Ethereum address.\n\n#### Recent Diamond News\n\nLast month [ConsenSys Diligence](https://diligence.consensys.net) conducted a public security audit of [Codefi's](https://codefi.consensys.net/) contracts. Consensys Diligence [recommended or suggested](https://diligence.consensys.net/audits/2020/06/codefi-erc1400-assessment/#diamond-standard) that Codefi use the Diamond Standard to solve the maximum contract size limit problem.\n\nRonan Sandford ([wighawag](https://twitter.com/wighawag)), a prominent smart contract developer and an author of the ERC-1155 standard, [announced](https://twitter.com/wighawag/status/1280992800545349644) he is working on adding support for diamonds to [buidler-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/buidler-deploy#readme) to make it very easy to deploy/cut diamonds. buidler-deploy is a mechanism to deploy contracts to any network, keeping track of them and replicating the same environment for testing.\n\nJoey Zacherl, a developer at [VolleyFire](http://joeyzacherl.com/2018/10/volleyfire-liquidity-provider-for-decentralized-exchanges/), released a Python tool called [Diamond Setter](https://github.com/lampshade9909/DiamondSetter) that is a contract manager for diamonds. Here is his blog post about it: [Diamond Setter, Ethereum smart contract manager](http://joeyzacherl.com/2020/06/diamond-setter-ethereum-smart-contract-manager/)\n\nThe Diamond Standard got its first [popular Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/gze6k3/a_diamond_is_a_set_of_contracts_that_can_access/).\n\nIf you want to learn more about diamonds read this article: [Understanding Diamonds on Ethereum](https://dev.to/mudgen/understanding-diamonds-on-ethereum-1fb).\n\nAnd this article: [Ethereum's Maximum Contract Size Limit is Solved with the Diamond Standard](https://dev.to/mudgen/ethereum-s-maximum-contract-size-limit-is-solved-with-the-diamond-standard-2189)\n\nI am the author of the Diamond Standard so if you have any questions let me know.

hu4x8d,1595181938,Here's why high fees are good for the Ethereum ecosystem,"Wether high transaction fees are good or bad is a controversial topic. In this post I want to explain why high transaction fees not only are good for the Ethereum ecosystem, but they will also cause the ETH price to go up in the long run.\n\nFirst of all, we should ask ourself: what is Ethereum and what brings value to ETH? Ethereum is a decentralized computer that offer decentralized services in exchange for fees. **The value of what the Ethereum network produces can be quantified as the sum of all the daily fees paid by all the Ethereum users**. That's how much people are willing to pay in order to be part of the Ethereum ecosystem, so that represents the demand.\n\nIn the Ethereum network users pay fees for gas at a certain gas price that is decided by the market. The math behind gas fees can be explained with just 3 metrics:\n\n* DAILY\_PAID\_FEES: is the amount of ETH paid for fees everyday, and as we were saying before it represents the value of what the Ethereum network produces ( [https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee](https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee) )\n* AVG\_GAS\_PRICE ( [https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice](https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice) )\n* DAILY\_GAS\_USED: since the gas per block and the number of blocks that can be produced everyday are capped this value is capped too, at least until the Ethereum network is capable of scaling further ( [https://etherscan.io/chart/gasused](https://etherscan.io/chart/gasused) )\n\n**DAILY\_PAID\_FEES = AVG\_GAS\_PRICE \* DAILY\_GAS\_USED**\n\nLately, DAILY\_PAID\_FEES have reached record highs in ETH by almost doubling the fees of 2017, which is extremely good. This basically means that the ratio between what Ethereum produce and it's price is at its peak. Please notice that daily network fees have NOT broken the 2017 record in USD, as the ETH/USD ratio was much higher back then.\n\n[data from etherscan.io](https://preview.redd.it/upw2did6kub51.png?width=1578&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9c6146e53dedb5c2ea300d58617b44b9c801b59)\n\nTo understand better why high DAILY\_PAID\_FEES will increase ETH price in the long run you can think about this analogy: **when PoS will be available, DAILY\_PAID\_FEES will be the ""dividend"" that is paid to stakers**. Of course ETH is also an inflationary currency so that's another incentive for the stakers, but a large part of their reward will come from fees. If DAILY\_PAID\_FEES are high people will want to stake ETH in order to earn a yield, and this will cause the ETH price to increase.\n\nAn argument against high gas fees is that they will cause users to run to other ecosystems where fees are lower. And while this is true, we should look at the big picture in the long term. The solution to this problem is **scalability.** Today DAILY\_GAS\_USED is capped so the only way DAILY\_PAID\_FEES can go up is if AVG\_GAS\_PRICE increase. But with ETH 2.0 DAILY\_GAS\_USED will be able to increase much more. 10x, 100x, 1000x, or even more? No one really knows. But what's important is that today the demand for Ethereum gas is really high and so DAILY\_PAID\_FEES will be able to increase much more while keeping AVG\_GAS\_PRICE low.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hu4x8d/heres_why_high_fees_are_good_for_the_ethereum/,7,101
