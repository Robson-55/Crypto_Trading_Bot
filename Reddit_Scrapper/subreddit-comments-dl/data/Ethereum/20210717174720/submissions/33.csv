h0tfif,1591855766,"Consortium-managed chain, real-time public read-only","tl;dr - publicly readable chain, but writes and block resolution handled by consortium.  Probably not Quorum.  Looking at Parity PoA.\n\nWe are looking for a chain that allows a consortium to control all block resolution -  as well as all activity on the chain - but want everything to be perfectly visible to the public.  Our implementation has no use for coin issuance, but nothing works without transparency of the full chain.\n\nParity PoA seems like what we need, as it allows control of block resolution.  We'd like these same nodes to be the only ones that can participate in transactions.  Anyone can operate a read-only node, or read off of any number of nodes made public... this transparency is paramount, and trust will be assumed in this case by the makeup of the authorized consortium.\n\nuse-case:  \n\- roughly 7 orgs allowed to make transactions.  no reason for others to participate in writes.  \n\- transactions are not between orgs; they're purely ledger entries of certain actions.  \n\- transactions meant to be public, the actual bedrock of the system.  \n\- to the above, anyone can have full read-only and query access to the chain, performance will be the responsibility of the consortium.  download the whole chain, but no mining is helpful or needed.\n\nQuorum seems like what we need.  Not only overkill, but misaligned with the goals.  It allows private transactions which we do not need, or even want to invite that possibility, and is node-to-node transaction forward.\n\nPoA on a private Ethereum network the way to go?  Or would a public network with an allowed list of addresses to participate in writes be enough?  I don't know enough about mining to know how to make the network a free-for-all other than the mining element... no reason for it, and losing control of the network would be catastrophic, as this is never meant to be fully open.  Staying on Ethereum seems like a no-brainer unless we really have to choose a fork or completely different protocol.\n\nThanks a lot for getting this far if you did.  Open to any input no matter how colorful the language. \n\nTake care,\n\nMark",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/h0tfif/consortiummanaged_chain_realtime_public_readonly/,2,0
