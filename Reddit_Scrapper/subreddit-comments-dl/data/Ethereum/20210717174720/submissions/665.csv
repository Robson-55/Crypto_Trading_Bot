nbs9t3,1620942320,Thoughts on the best time to buy ethereum during the dip?,So ethereum at $3700 is super appealing. I’m about to buy my first coin but should I buy in chunks as it goes up and down? Should I just buy 1 whole coin at once? Does anyone think it’ll dip more? I’m using Robinhood to buy because of the no fees thing but also have Coinbase. I’m new to Coinbase so I wasn’t sure what the differences were between these platforms.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nbs9t3/thoughts_on_the_best_time_to_buy_ethereum_during/,1,37

nbwryz,1620954872,"Ethereum enables trustless collectivism with minimal overhead, something the world has never seen","We regularly see areas where collectivism can be fairly powerful, where an entire group of people pooling their resources enables them to compete with even the biggest players, or to distribute their risk so no one has to suffer alone when disaster strikes.\n\nWhile we see this in action in the real world with governments, insurance, banking, and other areas, this has always required a trusted party to act as the treasurer or arbiter of the pooled resources. This centralization of control over so much power creates too many opportunities for corruption, and as a result many people prefer to avoid it all together.\n\nBut smart contracts can change that, we already see it with exchanges like Uniswap, staking pools like RocketPool, and lending platforms. We finally have a way that people can participate in a collective with minimal overhead and virtually no chance for corruption.\n\nIt's very exciting, and as someone who is generally an anti-collectivist, it really is amazing that this technology is bringing us a way that we can have so many of the benefits without the drawbacks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nbwryz/ethereum_enables_trustless_collectivism_with/,1,14
