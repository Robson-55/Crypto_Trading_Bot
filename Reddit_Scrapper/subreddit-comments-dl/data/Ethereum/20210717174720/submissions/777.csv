nzvvj6,1623701713,A simple explanation of why we need blockchain technology,"So you know when you hear a hot stock pick and you think to yourself, ""I gotta get in on this one."" So you hope skip and jump onto your favorite trading ap, just to find out your funds are a little low. So now you need to deposit some coin So you don't miss out on the next great AMC or GME!!! You hit deposit....then.....BOOM!! ""YOUR FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR TRADING IN 5-6 BUSINESS DAYS."" Well slap me in the nuts and steal money right out of my wallet, you think to yourself. This is why we need blockchain, eliminate that middle man and get immediate access to all that is rightfully yours. I mean why miss out on losing money with everyone else while ypu are waiting for your funds.

o07kuj,1623738292,What are the chances of an ETH hard fork?,"Controversial idea, but what are the chances that the mining pool doesn‚Äôt play along with the ETH 2.0 upgrade and there is a hard fork?\n\nThere are a lot of people making good money and heavily invested in ETH mining that are probably not too happy about losing their revenue stream.  I also see that the time that the ETH could be tied up and rewards of staking ETH for 2.0 aren‚Äôt particularly incentivising compared to some other staking rewards offered by other tokens, so I‚Äôm wondering what the chances are of there being a hard fork?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o07kuj/what_are_the_chances_of_an_eth_hard_fork/,1,18
o07ldj,1623738348,Trustless referral network based on ERC-20 token based dApp,"I am not entirely sure whether this is the correct forum to discuss a new idea based on an ERC-20 token. Also, I am not sure whether this use case is already considered and proven wrong. If so, letting me know will save a lot of valuable hours. \n\nMy idea is to create a D-App, which is a trustless referral platform and curated marketplace to sell products from Amazon or any other marketplace which allows referral earnings. Anonymous users can connect their wallets to the platform and create collections based on their tastes. Whenever they create a collection, they will be awarded a certain amount for tokens. The token that users will get is a custom token that is generated specifically for this network. These users will be known as collectors.\n\nNow normal users also can join the network and browse through collections. The collectors can either make their collections free or they can add a fee so that the normal users need to pay this fee in order to visit the collection. This way the token is being circulated. The referral links for each of the products will take the users to the corresponding market place and if they made a purchase, the commission will be processed. 75% of the commission will be awarded to users who make the purchase and 25% will go to the corresponding collector. This commission is also in terms of the token that is used in the network and based on the current dollar value of the token, \n\nI know this is very basic, but this is the idea. I am just testing whether this will work and it will be helpful if you let me know what you think about this? I am a programmer and web developer myself, so I can write smart contracts and deploy it to the network.
