n8dhb2,1620564135,[HELP] Will my transaction go through?,"Hey! \n\nSo I basically have a small amount of USDT (70$) I wanted to transfer from my CB Wallet to CB. But when I see the fees to transfer, I thought they were very high (approximately 25$). So I checked the average gas price and gas limit for a USDT transfer, saw the gas limit was \~46000 and when I checked, the lowest gas price was \~65.\n\nBut I didn't have that much ETH left so I put 60 in the gas price, and 50000 in the gas limit. Will it be pending forever ? I saw you could cancel a transcation by using the same nonce, but I don't wanna pay 20$ to cancel a 70$ transcation I already paid 12$ more on...  \nWill it go through eventually ? Should I cancel ? Any way to speed up by increasing the gas price ? (the transaction is showing up on etherscan but not on metamask, don't know why)\n\nThanks a lot for your help",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n8dhb2/help_will_my_transaction_go_through/,1,7

n8dl37,1620564534,Should I invest Â£1000 on my 18th birthday?,"Hey guys, I appreciate every single comment as I have about a weeks knowledge on Crypto currency. So in a weeks time I am turning 18 years old. And I have just found out about a Â£1000 trust fund I am able to claim. So to me this is money I never realised I had and thats why im willing to take a risk on it. As if I have been given an opportunity. With the rise of crypto currency and the growing values of these digital coins is it worth investing all this money into Ethereum? From the looks of my research Ive seen multiple posts discouraging crypto currencies but these people have been hating on bitcoin back when it was valued almost  Â£30,000 less per coin than it is today. So I assume they are turning in their graves right about now. Im wondering if Ethereum is projected to follow bitcoin in terms of growth and how likely it is that my money will be safe in this investment. I am aware on a low level that Russia is linked with using Ethereum in some way for a future currency and seeing with Russia's global ability and presence in the world shouldnt this in the long run indicate a massive growth in Ethereum? I am also sure im missing a lot of information so be sure to be critical with me if you are interested in helping me out. I think ive read about one issue being a market cap or not a fixed coin volume? Any explanations of the basics or advanced knowledge would be great help. Wishing everyone the best.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/n8dl37)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n8dl37/should_i_invest_1000_on_my_18th_birthday/,1,31
