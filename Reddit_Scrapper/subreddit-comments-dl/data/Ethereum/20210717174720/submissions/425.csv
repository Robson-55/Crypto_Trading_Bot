lshgec,1614288676,Will ETH L2 solutions just turn out like LN for BTC?,"I am very excited about the recent news regarding L2 solutions for Ethereum (namely the recent Optimism ORU news). \n\nHowever, if my understanding is correct, LN is an L2 solution for BTC that is geared at addressing  similar issues to the proposed L2 solutions for Ethereum (e.g. transaction/gas fees and transaction time) . Forgive me if this is wrong but so far (to me at least) it seems like LN could be considered a relative flop in that mass adoption is *still* not here and people are *still* complaining about the tx fees for BTC. \n\nMy question is this: what is so different about the L2 solutions for Ethereum that is going to make them more adopted en masse/more impactful than LN was/is for BTC?\n\nOR is the Ethereum L2 scenario totally different to BTC L2? For example: high tx fees/gas fees are arguably more of an issue with Ethereum presently than they were for BTC; the incredibly high number of applications making use of Ethereum (basically the whole of DeFi , DeXes, dApps); and big players already stating that they are going to make use of the ORU solution (e.g. uniswap, synthetix, coinbase, kraken etc) .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER: This is not meant as any kind of FUD - I love Ethereum and everything it has birthed to the crypto-space.
