lh0jx5,1612982731,"Looking for advice on setting up a grant-style DAO for managing a fund where the mission is to combat ""New Normal"" propaganda","I'm a mod over at r/NoNewNormal and I'm a lockdown and mask skeptic. I'd like to build a DAO designed to fund a PR effort to combat some of the propaganda surrounding current non-pharmaceutical interventions that are in place to ostensibly reduce the spread of covid-19. I'm somewhat technically inclined but new to Ethereum. I'd like the fund to be censorship and embezzlement resistant. I think Ethereum is the only technology ready for this task.\n\nI'm wondering if there are resources you could point me to or any advice you could give me on achieving my goal. This project https://daostack.io/ seems interesting but I have no experience with it. I also wonder if I should instead look into coding the DAO from scratch. Alternatively, I could try to raise funds to get the DAO built by existing experts in the field. Does anyone know whom those experts might be? Is anyone here interested?\n\nAny advice/resources/people you can point me at is very much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lh0jx5/looking_for_advice_on_setting_up_a_grantstyle_dao/,0,2

It's worth something now so I want to transfer my LEND to Binance and swap if for AAVE. But I need some ETH in my Eidoo wallet for fees.  \n  \nSo I bought $15 worth of ETH on Binance (minimum I could purchase) and want to send it to Eidoo. But it's asking me to choose a network - BEP2, BEP20 or ERC20. I'm not at all familiar with this - if I select ERC20 it says the fee is 0.005 ETH which is pretty much half my $15. Is that right? Will one of the other 2 options (BEP2 or BEP20) work?  \n  \nThanks In advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lh1vtp/quick_noob_question_i_have_lend_on_eidoo/,6,16
