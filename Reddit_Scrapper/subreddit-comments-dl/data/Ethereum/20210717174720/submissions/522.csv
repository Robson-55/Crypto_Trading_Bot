mrne07,1618518576,Dropped &amp; Replaced transaction but Ether amount not showing up,"This is really getting me scared now :(\n\n1. I made a few transactions using Metamask chrome extention wallet and they all didnt go through. They were queued in the pipeline. \n2. Over next few hours, transaction happened eventually but last transaction of 8 ethers got stuck.\n3. I checked it up and it looked like not enough gas fee and I assumed because it was queued for too long, the gas price is changed. Thought of cancelling and re-sending so cancelled the transaction in Metamask and now I am in panic.\n4. [Etherscan.io](https://Etherscan.io) says the transaction is dropped and replaced but suddenly those 8 ethers are missing. They are not showing up on receiving address and neither back in my wallet. \n\nShould I just wait? Is there anything I can even do about this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvcmvsn4det61.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=277d63e74fb07ea80be3dfa1e5ef7189291003f2",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mrne07/dropped_replaced_transaction_but_ether_amount_not/,1,16

mroyed,1618523269,Binance - value of my (B)ETH lower than it should be?,"Hi all\n\nI staked my ETH on Binance a few weeks ago. The performance seemed lower than it should be when I looked at the current value of my BETH, so I checked its performance by calculating \[units held\] x \[current price\]. It is indeed c.6% lower than this calculation suggests it should be. \n\nIs this because of the BETH/ETH trading pair (BETH trading at a 5% discount to ETH, until ETH 2.0 is live when I can convert my BETH back to ETH at 1:1)? There's no BETH/GBP trading pair so are they using BETH/ETH rate --&gt; then ETH/GBP to calculate the live value?\n\n Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mroyed/binance_value_of_my_beth_lower_than_it_should_be/,1,2
