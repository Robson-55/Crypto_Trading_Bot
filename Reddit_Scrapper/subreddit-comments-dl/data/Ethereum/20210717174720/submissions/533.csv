mtynwo,1618832110,Argument with professor about Fat Protocol Thesis. Please weigh in:,"\n\n\n**My argument:** Look at the last crypto cycle. How many coins that were top ten in 2017 are top ten now? There‚Äôs two: BTC and ETH. But, here‚Äôs the shocking thing, if you expand the list to the top 50, how many are ERC? 33 are. Not surprising, but ERC-based tokens are starting to dominate the mid-tier and slowly moving up the list.\n\n**Her argument:** This is proof that Ethereum is not benefiting from *fat protocol thesis,* and that the thesis is wrong.\n\n**My counter argument:** If that were true, ETH should not have the valuation it does, approximately double what is was last time, and it shouldn‚Äôt have the exponential transaction volume. Clearly it‚Äôs benefiting.\n\n**Her deathblow:** The price is due to speculation.\n\n**My final rebuttal:** Even WBTC (wrapped bitcoin) is a top 20 coin now, which is a predatory behavior, because it means the Ethereum protocol is starting to eat things not natively built on it. I then compared email to the USPS and said email hasn‚Äôt killed the USPS, but has taken a much of what would‚Äôve been its business (the usps has come close to insolvency many times). Also I invoked USDC‚Äôs growth, noting that it‚Äôs now 28% of Tether‚Äôs mkt cap and gaining. That was unthinkable two years ago. \n\n**Her dismissal:** Speculation can do incredible things. \n\nI wasn‚Äôt satisfied how the argument ended and I‚Äôd like the board to weigh-in on this please! Clearly something is going on, even if we‚Äôre not certain yet. My longterm view is that if gas fees collapse and staking becomes available to the masses (two promises of 2.0) then ETH/ERC can consume (or straight make burnt toast of) everything not BTC or a privacy coin.

mtysi5,1618832631,SmokeSignal is a free speech platform built on Ethereum and EVM chains. Live now!,"Hey all! Just wanted to present our platform SmokeSignal, at https://smokesignal.eth.link (or plain smokesignal.eth, on Opera or other ENS-capable browsers). On SmokeSignal, all posts are permanent and uncensorable, and all users are un-deplatformable. The faces you see on the site correspond to Ethereum addresses: all users are pseudonymous by default.\n\nInstead of upvotes, we can burn or tip crypto. Burning increases a post's visibility; tipping simply rewards the author. You can see already that some of the posts or replies have actually earned more than they burned. Remember the old days when people used reddit crypto tipping bots, and you could reply with a nice $1 or $2 thank you to some kind stranger? Tipping works like that, but is native to the platform.\n\nWe're finally at a point where we've started to market it and grow the community on SmokeSignal.
