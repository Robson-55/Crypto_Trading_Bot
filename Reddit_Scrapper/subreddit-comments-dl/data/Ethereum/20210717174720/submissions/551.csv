mwtvx7,1619180053,Arteon,"Hi guys!\n\nNo sugar coating. Check out: https://arteon.org/.\n\nIt released recently on Uniswap. They're going to be releasing a platform that allows users to both stake and mine ARTEON using ""simulated GPU NFTs"" which I know is unheard of. Seems very exciting though especially with the buzz around NFTs right now.\n\nDespite the markets being shaky, their chart remained very strong. They're have a great site but are revamping it to add a roadmap and a more indepth look at the tokenomics. The marketing campaign starts this weekend so we're still early. They also hold frequent airdrops on their discord server and they're listed on CG and some others too. \n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arteon\n\nhttps://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/Arteon-ARTEON\n\nhttps://t.me/ARTEONDEFI\n\nhttps://discord.gg/hW8KytkbJ8\n\nhttps://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x897abf83f0c44b86cb67ec56c006c00d56659517&amp;outputCurrency=ETH\n\nhttps://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x922543b050cc937b7beb62c2bd22c7916cb4e4c5\n\nIt's looking solid!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mwtvx7/arteon/,1,1

These decentralized financial networks I believe are the future and will make us more free. It removes control from traditional monetary systems and gives it to us the retail investor. I‚Äôm proud of this moment, and excited to join you all! The Internet made the world smaller, and Ethereum will turn everyone into neighbors, bothers, and sisters.

mwwyzx,1619189401,April 2021: Where can I buy ETH with LOWEST fee and in NY State while using a Bank transfer?,"Hi,\n\nI live in NY State and yesterday while trying to set up my [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) I received a ""STOP"" message from them saying that I can not do it (since my ID is from NY State). \n\nLater, I tried the same with Gemini but the page with my phone number ""freezes"" and never gives me the chance to receive a confirmation code (I can not set up the account). After that I sent them a request to know WHY I can not get the code (may be because my phone number is associated with TextNow, an app type,.... and not ATT, Verizon or T-Mobile?). \n\nThe truth is that this is very frustrating and time intensive.\n\nCan someone help me with:\n\n1) Where can I buy ETH with LOWEST fee and in NY State while using a Bank transfer?\n\n2) Would you recommend using Metamask to keep part of my ETH safe (out of the exchange)?\n\n3) If you had little savings (probably enough for a down payment in USA) would you invest it all in crypto? Side note: I hate Wall St, Bankers and Hedge Funds that made the whole Housing Bubble possible (and many other financial/war disasters around the world). As you can tell I never invested in anything before but I am sick and tired of others (Banks) making money with my money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mwwyzx/april_2021_where_can_i_buy_eth_with_lowest_fee/,1,17
