mqpyj6,1618404893,Question about NFT contract types and minting fees,"Hi, I'm putting the question here because it is kind of hard to get a definite answer in the NFT community.   \n\n\nIf you look at the minting prices on a popular NFT market [https://raribleanalytics.com/](https://raribleanalytics.com/)   \nyou will find that the price of minting ERC-721 is consistently significantly higher than ERC-1155.  \nI find this puzzling since - according to my understanding - the properties of ERC-1155 is a superset the ERC-721 , allowing more control over the tokens (selling multiple copies of them). So what explains the higher price. What is the advantage in minting ERC-721?   \nThe only reason I can think of that ERC-721, being an older type of contract is in some way better supported in the Ethereum ecosystem, is that it? Thanks in advance for elucidating.

I decided to get back into trading cyrpto this year and I learned the hard way you can't just lock a hardware wallet away and not maintain it.\n\nLuckily I was only one old firmware version away from not being able to upgrade my Nano. I did it and got the BTC and Litecoin off, but the ETH app was not on it.  When I reinstalled the ETH app there was no ETH on the wallet.  \n\n\nI went back and looked at my records and have the transaction from coinbase transferring the ETH to my wallet.

mqrbeb,1618409248,"New to Eth, what's the value proposition/differentiator from the other big coin?","Hello, I didn't see a noobie thread or FAQ so please excuse the basic question. I was previously 100% in bitcoin, I recently converted half over to Eth because I hold in BlockFi and they cut interest rates over 1btc so I moved the rest of mine into eth for the 5.25% plus eth seems to have more growth potential.\n\nAnyways, now that I find myself owning quite a lot I wanted to see what the main differentiator and value of eth is. Bitcoin has basically taken hold of the ""store of value"" space as a deflationary hedge, limited supply 21mil decentralized etc, digital gold. But it's not going to be an actual currency due to obvious flaws and transaction times imo, really just view it as a decentralized capped supply digital gold is the selling point.\n\nI know already that eth has much larger supply, and is much more centralized as Vitalik essentially controls it. What's like the simple selling point for eth is it much better equipped to actually become a currency? I've seen applications are developed using it, just curious what's the argument for the value of the coin itself to go up?

mqw5by,1618423190,Transaction fee exceeding the amount I want to move for what BAT and other random tokens I have are worth,"Okay so I have a bunch of ETH off exchange so the fee wasn't to bad to bite. But for all my tokens that are worth $100 or less the fee is just to expensive to ever move them. Meaning Ethereum is completely unusable. I tried paying $12 even bumped it up to $18 and the tokens will not move. The wallet is estimating I pay a $40 fee to move a token. I also can't seem to find a way to send all tokens at once in the same transaction so I pay the fee once. It seems so stupid that I have to pay the fee more then once and do every token transaction individually, I don't see any way to send multiple at once, which is what I want to do.\n\nI already hate Ethereum at this point. The network scammed me. With bitcoin I just send another transaction and they just take the transaction with a higher fee, and it invalidates the old one like it never happened. With ETH I sent the transaction again as it didn't take it with the lower fee, and now it charged me the fee twice to move the same coins, it took the one with the higher fee to finally move the coins. Right after they took my transaction with the higher fee, they then also took my transaction with the lower fee, which the miners and network failed to move previously before I created the second transaction with a higher fee, but now they decided to all the sudden process the transaction with a lower fee which it look like they never where going to do before. Since the other transaction with a higher fee already went through my balance was zero, the transaction with the lower fee failed as there where no coins left to move, they scammed me as they took this fee and the network did nothing as far as moving my coins.\n\nI also don't understand this Gas Limit vs. Gas Fee. If I up the gas Fee and lower the Gas Limit VS. Lower the Gas fee and Up the Gas limit wouldn't that be the same thing for the total fee in the end?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mqw5by/transaction_fee_exceeding_the_amount_i_want_to/,1,15
