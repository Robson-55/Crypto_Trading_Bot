kqs3px,1609826750,ETH Scaling Solution Optimism Set To Launch Its Preliminary Mainnet By Jan 15," \n\nThe preliminary mainnet of Optimism, an Ethereum (ETH) scaling solution providing firm, is now ready for launch. Optimism is a layer two scaling solutions developer and is developing a layer-2 scaling solution for the worldâ€™s second-largest blockchain network Ethereum. The firm has revealed its plans recently that it is all set to roll out the preliminary mainnet.\n\nAs reported by The Block, the company is likely to launch the preliminary mainnet on the 15th of January. Reportedly, it will be the first trial run of the mainnet of the Ethereum Optimism. The first trial run of the preliminary mainnet will be rolled out together by Optimism and Synthetix, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol.\n\nThe main aim of this scaling solution will be to resolve the scaling problem of the Ethereum network. It will create a channel in order to make it possible that all of the transactions on the Ethereum network are conducted in a quick manner. This channel will also help in reducing transaction costs on the network. A total of 1.2 million transactions are currently run on the network. And the cost of a single transaction is extremely high as users are charged with a massive fee of $15 per transaction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kqs3px/eth_scaling_solution_optimism_set_to_launch_its/,1,4
