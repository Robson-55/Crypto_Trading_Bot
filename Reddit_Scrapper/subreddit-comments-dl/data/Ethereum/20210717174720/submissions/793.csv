o4nlxr,1624251973,Ethereum Transaction Summary Tool,"Hi guys .\n\nI've been a long time lurker on this sub and have recently dabbled into a bit of the coding space. One think I found most challenging for mass adoption is the technical jargons, know-how and lack of newbie-friendly tools that are relatable to the current financial systems. I see a lot of great influencers on Youtube, Twitter, TikTok etc that are helping educate people, but I think what we really need is to put the tools in the hands of everyday people. \n\nOne thing I found that seems particularly daunting to new users is the way people check transactions on tools such as Etherscan. There are all these hashes and long addresses that probably doesn't mean a thing in a lot of the situations. I decided to make a tiny step to changing that by building a more visually simplified transaction viewer which aggregates &amp; simplifies all your transactions in one place - similar to bank statements. \n\n[Ethereum Transaction Viewer](https://excelwiz.com.au/crypto)\n\nThis hobby project is in early stages at the moment (hosted on my other business domain). If there is enough interest in this tool, I'd definitely be encouraged to build out more robust features such as registering it's own domain, expanding into multiple cryptocurrencies, more different viewing option checkboxes, and the labelling of public addresses so transactions are more easily recognizable. \n\nAs a crypto enthusiast, privacy is at the core of this project. No user data (e.g. wallet addresses) are stored on our website - they are all processed locally on your computer. \n\nHave a try and let me know what you think. If anyone wants to help out on this project, DM me!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4nlxr/ethereum_transaction_summary_tool/,1,1

o4wkzo,1624286303,Thoughts on Sorare (Ethereum NFT based game)?,"Hi fellow redditors, I'd be very interested in hearing you guys' thoughts on **Sorare**, since I've seen that related recent posts on crypto-subs have been getting some traction.\n\nFor those who have not heard of it, here is my current understanding of it:\n\nSorare is essentially similar to a classical fantasy football game, only that you play with digital cards. Sorare cards are NFT's (digital collectibles) using the Ethereum blockchain. Each football player's card is tradeable inside and outside of the platform and depending on their performance in real-life games, they can score points that would increase their card value and assist it's owner to be elligeable for rewards when partaking in Sorare tournaments.\n\nIt's basically a crypto variant of FIFA'S Ultimate Team (for those familiar with it) in the sense that you can acquire player cards which can then be featured in your squad for you to compete with others.\n\nEach card is subject to a limited supply and features various characteristics like age of the player, a serial number and a scarcity (Unique, Super Rare (10 copies) and Rare (100 copies)). There are multiple layers that define the value of a card:\n\n1. its collectable desirability (as any other NTF)\n2. its in-game value, depending on player perfomance/skills and\n3. a third-party game value (which I have not yet perfectly understood, but apperently there are other games where these cards can be used).\n\nNot all global football leagues are yet covered by Sorare, since they require to enter licensing deals with league federations and teams. However more and more regions and teams have been joining over time and the platform seems to be growing quite rapidily in terms of player base, supposedly being backed by prominent football players (Griezmann to name one, can't remember the others).\n\nI have bought/sold a couple of cards now, without participating in the tournaments yet. Also, I do not have yet gotten a good grasp on how ETH volatily affects card prices and in-game rewards/prizes. But in general, the game and its mechanics have been fun and enticing so far.\n\n**Do you guys think that this platform could have some serious potential?** I am worried for it to be a bubble of which the tokens will eventually end up having no value at all. On the other side, I could also see or other similar platforms arising or the game getting very popular. To me it seems like Sorare has the first mover advantage, since it already acquired many licenses and thus could potentialy be viable as an investment opportunity (e.g. buying undervalued players and sell these with a premium combined with collecting in-game money prizes).\n\n**Does anyone have any experience with this specific or similar games/platforms and would be willing to share?**\n\nFinally, I don't mean to shamelessly plug my links, but If anyone is planning on joining or trying out the game, you might aswell use my referal link: [sorare.com/r/kyrotos](https://sorare.com/r/kyrotos).
