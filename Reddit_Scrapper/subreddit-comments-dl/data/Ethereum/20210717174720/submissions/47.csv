This one below might be of specific interest to this community.\n\n**Ethereum 2.0 | Staking Overview**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfYU3KL29tE&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfYU3KL29tE&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nOutline:\n\nRamon Perez, Head of Support at Multi.io, is digging into why the Ethereum 2.0 Proof-of-Stake model is different from the current POS blockchains in the market today.\n\nEthereum 2.0 has seen major development progress in the last 6 months with the launch of a successful testnet of its staking layer the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Beacon Chain introduces new token economics to the Ethereum ecosystem. The Beacon chain locks away Ether for an unknown time (until Ethereum 2.0 if fully developed) creating the perception of two different Ethereum tokens that have raised the misconception that Ethereum 2.0 can fork off from Ethereum to become its own blockchain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/he9dls/ethereum_20_staking_overview_by_multiio/,1,0

I have advices to post this idea on Ethereum Reddit having in rare chance someone wants to set up a server.\n\nFor example [GnuPG][1] has a Public Key Server, where users able to obtain other users public-keys by using a key ID.\n\nhttps://security.stackexchange.com/a/110146/179928:\n&gt; OpenPGP User IDs\n&gt; \n&gt; User IDs in OpenPGP are used to connect keys to entities like names\n&gt; and e-mail addresses. These are used to search for keys on key\n&gt; servers, and matching them to users/e-mail addresses.\n\n\n\n```\nnode_a&gt; gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com    --send-keys EFA2F330\nnode_b&gt; gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys EFA2F330\n```\n\n----\n\n**=&gt;** Does `go-ethereum` provides this approach for `Whisper` where key-ids might be the user's Ethereum address in order to obtain other geth nodes' public key for `Whisper`?\n\n[Here:][2]\n&gt; `targetPeer (optional)`: Peer ID (for peer-to-peer message only).\n\nThan is actual from this [comment][3]:\n&gt; It is indeed be the enode of your target peer. See https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/whisper/whisperv6/api.go#L294. \n\nOverall, if I use `enode` as alternative to public-key, which is much larger string than the public key itself.\n\n\n  [1]: https://gnupg.org\n  [2]: https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.geth.html?highlight=whisper#web3.geth.txpool.Shh.post\n  [3]: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/18003#issuecomment-505398719",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/heccn2/does_goethereumwhisper_provides_any_kind_of/,1,0
