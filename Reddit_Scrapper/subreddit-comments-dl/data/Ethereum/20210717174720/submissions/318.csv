Sorry for the re-submit! Don't want to wake up with 0 answers.\n\nYeah, so I'm just starting off with cryptocurrencies but it all looks so damn promising. I'm seeing new and lots of people predicting that the price of Ethereum could skyrocket to nearly $10,000 or even further, just like bitcoin.\n\nHow/where do I start?\n\nWhat's the main website to buy from?\n\nShould I be using cold storage? Like with one of the encrypted USB drives?\n\nCould I instead just put it on a USB? I doubt even if my house gets robbed that they would find it so should that be ok? Or is there some other concerns with it? I won't be likely using it outside of my home.\n\nThanks for your help. I know I am new at this but man do I have a huge fear of missing out right now.

Numerous times now I see if I would have just waited I would have made a nice profit. So here I am last night, put everything into etherium. I said this time I won’t pull out. Of course this time it drops significantly more then I would have let it normally go. Should I just wait it out or should I sell and try to make it back somewhere else?

l19yqw,1611152078,Is my ETH lost for good???,So recently I sent some ether to the elastOS wallet not knowing that it using a different chain for transactions and long story short basically just sent ETH from one address to another. Unfortunately I can’t access this ETH because the wallet does not allow it but I know it’s there because I’ve used etherscan.io and it shows the correct amount of ETH. I’ve been trying to import my mnemonic phrase into a new ETH wallet but when this happens it creates a new wallet address with none of the ETH stored in the address from the other wallet. Can anyone explain to me how exactly I access this ether or if it’s lost for good? Been trying a lot of different things and it doesn’t seem to be working out...

l1ckqz,1611160192,1559 and the Burning Theory wedge,"Why destroy real value today, to possibly maybe perhaps have greater value at some undetermined point in the future.\n\nThe argument is that by reducing supply, that should in theory increase the value of every remaining unit. But in reality that's not exactly how it seems to happens.\n\nI'll give you a concrete example: Stellar's XLM. In Nov 2019 they decided to burn 50% of their supply. According to the Burning Theory, this move should have double the price of every unit, right? There was a short pump, and then a few weeks later the price went back to pre-burn levels. Stellar had literally burned billions with zero lasting effects. Price stagnated until the recent bull market from the end of 2020 that saw all crypto raise.\n\nThat's my anti-burn argument. The illusion that burning will have some long lasting effects on the unit price is to me just that, an illusion, and it just needlessly removes capital from circulation.\n\n[https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/45793/the-stellar-foundation-has-burned-over-50-of-the-total-xlm-token-supply-canceling-airdrop-programs](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/45793/the-stellar-foundation-has-burned-over-50-of-the-total-xlm-token-supply-canceling-airdrop-programs)\n\n[XLM burned \&gt;50&amp;#37; of their supply that day and zero lasting effect on unit price](https://preview.redd.it/g5jc0ftdkic61.png?width=3212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b16266d8ed34ae6a6bfa3b1727b29dd6d1091245)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l1ckqz/1559_and_the_burning_theory_wedge/,1,11
