nlx5wp,1622081130,Dynamic Traverers for TrueBlocks allows customizable per-address access directly from Ethereum nodes,"We just added a great new feature to TrueBlocks. It's been in planning for a while, but is finally here. It allows you to write literally ten lines of code to fully customize per-account data extraction for any address using only the Ethereum node as the source of your data. This is what decentralized, permissionless data access looks like. \n\nHere's an article describing the new feature: [https://tjayrush.medium.com/dynamic-traversers-in-trueblocks-7e2215cb1af9](https://tjayrush.medium.com/dynamic-traversers-in-trueblocks-7e2215cb1af9)\n\nHere's our new help page: [http://docs.trueblocks.io](http://docs.trueblocks.io).\n\nHere's our blog: [http://docs.trueblocks.io/blog](http://docs.trueblocks.io/blog)\n\nHere's our discord server: [https://discord.gg/rMdunZHCuu](https://discord.gg/rMdunZHCuu)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nlx5wp/dynamic_traverers_for_trueblocks_allows/,1,0

Not a sound investment.\n\nThere are other blockchain projects with great developers and promise, but this almost logically requires ETH to fail and claim less market cap.

nlz8vz,1622088692,Trust model for smart contracts,"Hi\n\nI'm trying to wrap my head around the concept of smart contracts. I see that it's a self-executing contract when certain conditions are satisfied. But how can the satisfaction of such conditions are trusted and properly enforced? For example, a casino is supposed to pay out when the buyer wins. It is the casino that decides whether the buyer wins. Can the casino be trusted to honour the (smart) contract? How is trust/consensus established? If the buyer is expected to trust the casino to honour the contract, then why bother with blockchains at all?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nlz8vz/trust_model_for_smart_contracts/,1,14
