mykhyx,1619393540,"This got censored from /r/CryptoCurrency but is an important read: As a Venezuelan, cryptocurrencies are a blessing.","# **As a Venezuelan, cryptocurrencies are a blessing.**\n\n&gt; The horrible situation my country is going through is no secret to anyone, nor is the impact cryptocurrencies have had. These are increasingly expanding among different businesses. It is common to see stores accepting BTC, BCH, USDT, BNB, etc, either to buy technological devices such as phones, TVs and other appliances but also basic goods like food, cheese, ham, eggs, meat, and honestly this is extremely useful.\nOne of the biggest problems here is inflation, which makes our local currency useless and we are always looking to have an alternative method of saving like buying dollars or just getting food. It is crazy to keep Bolivares, as inflation eats it up in seconds and this is not an exaggeration. This leads to prices changing every day and there is no way to save money which is a big issue in case of an emergency.\n&gt;\n&gt;I do not have a large income, like most of my fellow countrymen, but I am passionate about the world of cryptocurrencies to the point that I accepted a job where I receive BTC as a salary. It is a very low amount, however, it is higher than what I would get working in a common job here. I have been saving what I can and it is much better than earning our currency, also is relatively protected against inflation. Last Christmas was better than in previous years because of this, so for that and more I am very thankful. My family really needed a good time for a change.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to make the most of the limited savings I have. I know it won't be much but what are the best ways to generate passive income with what little I have saved? I don't dare to trade due to my lack of knowledge and I would feel like I'm betting my life savings. I can't afford to lose that money but I guess I can do something like a fixed deposit, a loan or any other method that will help me generate a bit more every month.\n&gt;\n&gt; /u/Lazalia",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mykhyx/this_got_censored_from_rcryptocurrency_but_is_an/,1,24

It says it needs a small deposit of ether for gas but then it says I can trade a non ethereum coin for ethereum in order to cover the fee but then I fail to meet some sky high minimum amt and I still have no way to move any coins in or out. I'm really frustrated and confused as I am a small time crypto trader with not enough capital to cover these insane minimums.

mymfjh,1619400077,Ethereum is at a historic moment. Compare its technicals with Bitcoin.,"Ethereum is at a unique junction. There are several major updates pending over the next few months that will make it a deflationary asset, increase transaction rates, and decrease costs. Together, these updates will greatly improve the utility of Ethereum. \n\nProfessional traders are no idiots. They see that these upgrades will catalyze demand in the face of slowly diminishing supply. What happens to price? It will go up. \n\nThis is not the case for Bitcoin. Costs are high, supply is still going up, and network speed is limited. People prefer to use eth or alt coins for network transactions. \n\nThe so called eth killers won’t really have a big use case once Eth2 goes live. Why? Just pure market cap alone. And existing dapps and integration into major systems like PayPal, various exchanges, etc. Everyone carries Ethereum. \n\nNow that the roadmap has been solidified, the major traders are seeing that Ethereum is at a discount. Compare Bitcoin and Ethereum side by side over the past two weeks. Bitcoin plummets. Either simultaneously or shortly after, Ethereum gets pumped. Ethereum following or exceeding drops in Bitcoin just isn’t happening anymore. \n\nInterestingly, the alt coins are starting to follow trends in Ethereum too. They aren’t reacting as much to changes in Bitcoin. \n\nFolks, we had a market correction of about 25% compared to bitcoins ATH. But what about compared to Ethereum? Bitcoin still hovers around 50k. Ethereum is approaching its ATH now. \n\nIn my opinion, this is not a bear market. It is an extraordinary sea change in the utility of a specific coin. Bitcoin may have the greatest market share right now, but imagine what will happen if this flippening continues toward Ethereum. What could happen to Ethereum’s price point if it takes over bitcoins place?\n\nTo be clear, I am not an expert in any of these things. These are just my observations. I am not giving anyone financial advice nor making any recommendations.
