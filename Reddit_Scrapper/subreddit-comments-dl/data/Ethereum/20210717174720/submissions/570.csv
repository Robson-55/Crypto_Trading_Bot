n07kuj,1619586836,Question regarding compounding interest and ETH staking,"Was looking into staking my Ethereum on Kraken, but I noticed ""grow rewards"" turned off. \n\nGrowing rewards ""means the rewards you get from staking these assets will be added to staking."" \n\nIf this is turned off, then basically I won't benefit from compounded interest. Does anyone know if I can just funnel the weekly payout back into my staking account to benefit from an increasing ETH supply? If not, does anyone know of service that compounds the ethereum rewarded from staking back into your stake account?
