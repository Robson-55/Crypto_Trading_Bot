njf15w,1621797878,Is staking ETH on Coinbase safe?,"I'm determining whether to stake my ETH on Coinbase but the disclaimer in Coinbase's User Agreement is concerning.  It provides as follows:\n\n""(c) No Guarantee of Success of Network Upgrade.¬† Coinbase makes no guarantees that the upgrade to the Ethereum network will be successful, and you understand that if the network upgrade ultimately fails, you may lose all, or a portion of, your staked ETH.¬† Coinbase will not be responsible for any ETH lost due to a network upgrade failure.""\n\nSo, what's your thoughts on staking on CB?  It sounds great considering I plan to hold my ETH a long time, but I'm on the fence on whether the 6% is worth it given the foregoing language.  Perhaps stake some and not all to minimize risk and exposure.\n\nThanks and good luck!\n\nAlso note that Coinbase's Help Center explains further:\n\n""Are there risks staking ETH?¬†\n\nStaking can be rewarding, but it also comes with the risk of loss of principal funds if the validator duties are not met. However, Coinbase will cover these risks (at no extra costs) so your principal is safe.\nCoinbase cannot guarantee that the upgrade to the Ethereum network will be successful and is not responsible for any staked ETH lost due to an unsuccessful network upgrade or other factors not within our control. For more information on risks associated with ETH staking, please read section 5.4.4 of our¬†User Agreement.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/njf15w/is_staking_eth_on_coinbase_safe/,1,13

I want this message to be about the security of Ethereum.*\n\nAs a miner, I noticed my profits drop some substantial 60% from the highs a few weeks ago, mainly due to the crash in current prices of Ethereum.\n\nWith EIP-1559 + current prices, mining Ethereum will become unprofitable for me and 95% of other miners out there, given that I live in an area considered to be one of the cheapest electricity in the world (Canada, at only $USD 0.8/kwh).\n\nAt current prices + EIP-1559, I think the majority of miners will likely flee the network, leaving it vulnerable to the dreaded 51% attack.\n\nFor that reason, I moved my entire Eth holdings onto Eth 2.0 staking, as I consider that to be a safer blockchain for the time being (at least until prices recover).\n\nI think the Ethereum devs did not consider the effect on security EIP-1559 would have if it were to happen during a crash in the crypto market in general.

Yes full retard. Did it while fully awake. Question is, is the staking going to start right now or at some later date? Because it said that trading of ETH 2 was not available in my region.

njh9jr,1621803942,A few questions about lending/LP/staking,"There is so much happening in the ethereum ecosystem that I don‚Äôt know what to do with my ETH. All these LP‚Äôs with $1B+ invested and crazy (20+% is crazy in my mind) returns seem too good to be true. \n\nI was wondering if anyone could help answer some questions I have and provide suggestions as to what I should do with my ETH. I don‚Äôt plan on selling any time soon, that‚Äôs for sure. \n\nQuestions: \n\n1- Is lending cryptos the same as adding liquidity to a LP? Or are LP‚Äôs only for crypto pairs, and not simply, say, lending DAI or UNI?\n\n2-  Why is it that if I go to lend DAI on Coinbase Wallet, I can get a return of 6.6% APR, but if I go on Zapper.fi, and look at the DAI/ETH pair, there is a 31.27% 1Y return?\n\n2.5- Say on the SUSHI / ETH LP on Zapper.fi, why don‚Äôt I have to buy Sushi to provide liquidity? I tested out a DAI / ETH pool last october, and had to provide 50/50 DAI/Eth to join the pool.\n\n3- I have a substantial amount of Eth (less than 16) currently sitting idly. Should I wait until I can stake it, or is it worth it to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù it in a moderately safe option? More generally, what will you guys prioritize between DeFi and staking? \n\n4- Can Eth be staked while being in a hardware wallet?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/njh9jr/a_few_questions_about_lendinglpstaking/,1,5
