I was reading and some people say they can't unless they have access to the mnemonic phrase.

k7fcdd,1607200954,DeFI question,"Hi, wasn't sure in which sub to post that question so i'm gonna try here, sorry if it's a stupid question or wrong place.\n\nSo i started looking at Defi and the pros and cons and all that, being relatively new to crypto and so far mostly just buying and holding on a hardware wallet. \n\nMy question is let's say i have 1 eth, that i want to earn compound interest on. I need to exchange it for DAI or cDAI or any other, and i earn 8% interest for a year let's say. \n\nAt the end of that year, I want eth back, but the price of eth went up 20% that year...did i miss out on those extra 12%, or am i missing something. \n\nPossibly my cDAI token = 1 eth, so when i convert it back to eth it's still 1 eth...now worth 20% more than before. If that's the case then great, makes sense to me.\n\nThat's what's confusing me and i couldn't find a straight explanation online. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for the help, sorry for the noob question.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/k7fcdd/defi_question/,1,4
