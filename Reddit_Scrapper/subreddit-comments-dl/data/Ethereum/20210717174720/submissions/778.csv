o081pp,1623740106,Do IDOs require token issuers to provide the amount of capital they are trying to raise?,"I'm trying to understand one thing about IDO's. I know that liquidity pools work as automatic market makers and evaluate the supply of one asset to the other to determine prices, so take this scenario:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProject A wants to raise $20,000,000 by selling their ERC-20 tokens. They want to list it on a DEX.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo they need to provide $20,000,000 of ETH + $20,000,000 worth of their ERC-20 token, and then trade their ERC-20 tokens for ETH as the pool is filled with ETH and drained of their token? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor am I getting this completely wrong?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o081pp/do_idos_require_token_issuers_to_provide_the/,0,2
o0827c,1623740158,The ethereum.org website has gotten so good over time!,"So I had a talk about crypto with a non-technical family member recently. They knew a bit about Bitcoin from mainstream media but nothing further really. Of course I told them I'm excited about Ethereum and its tech and future.\n\nA few weeks later I talk to them again. Suddenly they're asking me questions about Dapps, DeFi and sharding(!). Turns out they found the [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org) website and read most of the learning pages. I was really impressed with their knowledge so I went to check it out afterwards.\n\nThe site has improved so much over time! The text seems very understandable for a general audience. All the nice artworks surely help too. I especially like [the page on the ETH2 vision](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision/).\n\nBig thumbs up to everyone who contributed üëç",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o0827c/the_ethereumorg_website_has_gotten_so_good_over/,86,13

I'm  new developer on Ethereum and would like to know something about smart contracts: How customizable are smart contracts?\n\nI'm thinking of an application based on NFT trading. Could I possibly write up a smart contract to have multiple people earn royalties from a single NFT?\n\nSay Person A mints the NFT for Person B, is there a way for both of these people to gain royalties from future trades?\n\nEdit: I found my answer: [https://ethereum.org/en/nft/#fractional-ownership](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/#fractional-ownership).
