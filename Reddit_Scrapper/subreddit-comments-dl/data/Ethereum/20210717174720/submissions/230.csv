k3vp5y,1606742710,When will be Ethereum 2.0 Usable?,"Amazing People of Ethereum community,   \nI have a few missing pieces in a Ethereum 2.0. As far as i know ongoing phase is just for validators. Meaning that if you send ETH to new version of blockchain you got to lock them in your validator node for staking and this will take some time.   \nMy question is when will you be able to unlock ETH 2.0 and actually do something with it (meaning transactions).   \nMy second questions is for smart contracts on ETH 2.0. I understand that in phase 0 there will be no smart contracts. So i guessed that in phase 1 (sharding) smart contract funcionality will be implemented right ?   \nRecently i ve read piece from Vitalik that Phase 2.0 might never come and i used to think that Phase 2 is a new implementation of smart contracts funcionality - so i am bit confused and would very much appreciate any information on the topic.   \n\n\nThank you and happy",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/k3vp5y/when_will_be_ethereum_20_usable/,1,39

k407b8,1606756730,A plain english explanation of what the expect from Ethereum 2.0,"Seven years after Vitalik Buterin published the Ethereum whitepaper in 2013, Ethereum has evolved into a thriving financial ecosystem. In 2020, the network is on pace to settle nearly $1 trillion in annual transactions for the first time, and currently supports over $100B in assets and tens of thousands of applications. \n\nDespite Ethereum’s undeniable success, its aspirations are loftier still. It aims to secure a significant base of the global economy, all while remaining globally accessible to individual users at its base layer. Achieving this under Ethereum’s current throughput of 15 transactions per second is simply not feasible.  \n\nEthereum 2.0 is a major network upgrade, years in the making, that if successful will scale Ethereum’s throughput by more than 1,000x, without sacrificing decentralization. It will also transform the network’s native asset, ETH, by bestowing it with new properties while bringing its long term inflation rate down below 1%.  \n\nWith the numerous layer-1 competitors eying Ethereum’s market share and the recent surge in DeFi activity pushing Ethereum to its limits, the stakes could not be higher. \n\nThe first major phase of ETH 2.0 will kick into high gear tomorrow at 12pm UTC (7am EST) with the launch of Phase 0 and the Beacon Chain. \n\n**Phase 0** \n\nEthereum 2.0 essentially boils down to creating a new blockchain from scratch with a new consensus mechanism (proof of stake) and new architecture (sharding) before porting all of Ethereum’s existing applications to the new chain without disruption. \n\nThe **Beacon Chain** is Ethereum 2.0’s proof of stake blockchain. Where Ethereum is currently secured via Proof of Work miners, the Beacon Chain will be secured through Proof of Stake **validators.** Where proof of work involves running specialized hardware that consume vast quantities of electricity, proof of stake requires downloading some software and committing a stake of 32 ETH to a smart contract.\n\nWhile the launch of the Beacon Chain will capture much of the excitement in the near future, outside of bootstrapping a network of proof of stake validators, this chain will have little functionality. Sharding and smart contract support will not be introduced until later phases.\n\nBefore Ethereum can port existing applications over to Ethereum 2.0, it’s next phase will need to launch which won’t occur until a year from now at the earliest.  \n\n**Phase 1** \n\nOnce Phase 0 has been completed and ETH 2.0’s validator set is firmly in place, **Phase 1** will implement new architecture for how the Beachon Chain stores data, called sharding. \n\nCurrently, Ethereum full nodes must store a full history of every transaction that’s ever occurred and process every new transaction on the network. This makes running a full node onerous and is a primary source of Ethereum’s scaling woes.\n\nSharding will subdivide Ethereum’s Beacon Chain into 64 pieces, or “shards”. Where nodes currently store data for the entire blockchain, each shard will have its own subset of nodes processing it. Sharding alone will scale Ethereum’s throughput by 64x. \n\nEven when sharding is implemented (possibly around this time next year), the entire Ethereum ecosystem will continue to run in parallel on the proof of work chain. \n\n**Phase 1.5 - “The merge”** \n\nOnce Ethereum’s Beacon Chain has a full set of PoS validators securing the network, and the chain has been subdivided into 64 parallel shards, then it will be time to merge Ethereum as we know it today into Ethereum 2.0. \n\nThis will be accomplished by merging all of the smart contracts and transaction data from the PoW chain into a shard under the PoS chain. At this point, Ethereum will have successfully transitioned from proof of work to proof of stake.  \n\nHowever, this will not take place until some time until 2022, so the earliest point in which the average Ethereum user today interacts with Ethereum 2.0 is at least one year away. \n\n**Phase 2 (that may never happen)** \n\nWhen the merge between Eth1 &amp; Eth2 takes place, all of the smart contracting execution will take place within a single shard on Eth2. \n\nThe final phase of Ethereum 2.0, Phase 2, involves unlocking smart contract execution across some or all the Beacon Chain’s 64 shards. Additionally, phase 2 may introduce a new virtual machine. \n\nHowever, this phase may end up being unnecessary with phases 0-1.5 and the adoption of a layer-2 scaling technique called “rollups.” Rollups are a type of layer 2 scaling technology that process transactions independently of the Ethereum blockchain, but settle snapshots of their state to the main chain. \n\n**Rollups + “Phase 1.5” would amount to a \~10,000x+ improvement in network processing capacity over the current state of Ethereum.** This means that if current layer-one protocols embrace rollups, Eth2 as it’s currently laid out may never fully launch, but Ethereum will reach its desired scalability within the next two years. \n\nThe messari team has put together a massive report on ETH 2.0 (which was the source of the breakdown).
