nsh42f,1622845255,"Why does Cardano claim that ""Cardano claims that it overcomes existing problems in the crypto market: mainly that Bitcoin is too slow and inflexible, and that Ethereum is not safe or scalable""","According to Wikipedia ""Cardano claims that it overcomes existing problems in the crypto market: mainly that Bitcoin is too slow and inflexible, and that Ethereum is not safe or scalable"". I am especially trying to understand the Ethereum is not safe part of the statement. What safety feature is Cardano criticizing about Ethereum???\n\nAnother criticism of Cardano from is especially their statement.\n\n*"" Current credentials issuance and verification systems are inherently  flawed. Document and control remains with the issuer, rather than the  individual, for example, which creates a strong dependency on  third-party agencies to verify the document‚Äôs authenticity. This usually  involves a manual, costly, and time-consuming process, depending on the  location and response time of the issuing authority. ""* \n\nI want to point to people in charge of Cardano that laws of **Information Relativity** apply everywhere in both physical and biological terms. For example My identity can only be transported and therefore verified at maximum rate of speed of light. On an interpersonal Level the most trusted authority on my identity is me. Maybe the next trusted would be my wife and my mom, then acquaintances and chain of personalities and identities in my social circles.\n\nAs a programmer when I look at Cardano development options I really sit on the sidelines. While Ethereum is struggling with Layer 2 solutions Cardano is still trying to figure out strategy to implement EVM so when **rationally comparing all the crypto solutions, applications and claims** I get confused about the claims made vs ethics and motivations vs financial hype in crypto community.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nsh42f/why_does_cardano_claim_that_cardano_claims_that/,1,1
