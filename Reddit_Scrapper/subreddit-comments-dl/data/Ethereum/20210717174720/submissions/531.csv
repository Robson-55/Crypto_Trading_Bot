mtg292,1618763189,New to ether and have a question,Hey yall. Friday morning I used blockchain to purchase $150 dollars of ethereum. Today it says itâ€™s still pending but says itâ€™s only worth 124.64. Why is this? If itâ€™s pending why is it reducing in the amount of money? Is it usual to take this long to not be in my account and just say pending? I donâ€™t see an option to speed up or give more money to the miners so I can have it in my account. I was hoping it would be pretty seamless like my experiences with bc and bc cash.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mtg292/new_to_ether_and_have_a_question/,1,7

Redditâ€™s own /r/place project was a great inspiration. \n\nWe acquired a OG cryptopunk, [#3421](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/3421), with the intention of giving it away for free. Are we crazy? Probably.\n\nBut at its very core dCanvas is about expanding the boundaries of blockchain and using that as a way to build community and promote social good. Every time 1/4 of the canvas sells out, we will give away NFTs (such as the CryptoPunk) to one of our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dcanvasapp) followers and donate to a charity with personal importance to us (such as American Cancer Society). We just announced a [pixel art contest](https://twitter.com/dcanvasapp/status/1383817206799028230) too where you can enter for free and win ETH or dCanvas NFTs.\n\nThe journey so far has been incredible -- we opened up an early allocation for first adopters and had to close in less than a week as the waitlist grew out the door. But we're opening up more soon, this is just the beginning, and weâ€™ll keep giving back to the world the whole way. If you want to learn more about the project check out our [whitepaper](https://dcanvas.co/whitepaper) or feel free to ask any questions here!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mtk6zq/we_are_dcanvas_and_we_bought_a_cryptopunk_to_give/,1,18
