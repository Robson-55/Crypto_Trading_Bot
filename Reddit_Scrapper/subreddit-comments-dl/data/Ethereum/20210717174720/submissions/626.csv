n7o7jt,1620476903,A potential use case for decentralized communication (DeCom)," Hi all. I'll start by saying that I am extremely new to crypto. My greatest achievement in coding was creating a reset button in Microsoft's VBA on Excel so bear with me. I'm spit-balling an idea here so constructive feedback on the idea is welcome!\n\nWhile I was reading about the various use cases for blockchains in general, and ETH in particular, I was intrigued by the ability to develop Dapps beyond traditional financial tools, including decentralized communication (DeCom). One of the most challenging things about communication today is the various platforms that don't play well together. Historically, if I wanted to call Aunt Ethel, I would pick up the phone, dial a numeric code specific to her, and we would get connected regardless of our platforms. We could use completely different service providers and it didn't matter. The phone would connect. It is the same with text messages, voicemail, and email. They are almost entirely agnostic when it comes to providers.\n\nBut video calling platforms are not. A Zoom call can only be received on Zoom. Same with Google Duo/Hangouts, FB messenger, WhatsApp, etc... You don't necessarily need an account to receive the call with Zoom and a few others, but you do need to get on their platform. For people who don't adapt quickly, like Aunt Ethel, this can be an issue.\n\nDoes DeCom offer a solution to this? Could I pick my favourite video calling Dapp, the way I choose my favourite wallet, and use it to connect to someone else's favourite video calling Dapp for real-time communication? What are some of the biggest hurdles to making this a reality?\n\nFYI, I've looked into some DeCom resources but haven't been satisfied. If you could direct me to some good ones, that would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n7o7jt/a_potential_use_case_for_decentralized/,1,3
