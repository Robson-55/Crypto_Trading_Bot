I guess I set the gas price too low since I only have $50 worth of ETH and the suggested gas prices were like $130. \n\nSo now my transaction is completely stuck.  I read that I should submit a new trade with the same ID to ""cancel"" the first one, and I've done that, but I'm running into the same issue, I don't have enough ETH to pay for the gas to cancel the dang thing.\n\nCan anyone give me some advice on what to do next?
