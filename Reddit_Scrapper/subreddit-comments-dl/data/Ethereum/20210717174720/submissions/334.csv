l7c7rx,1611876003,"As more and more people are restricted from their right to trade in by the likes of Robinhood and other platforms, I am here to propose my solution. A Decentralized Stock Exchange Discussion","A year ago I start production of creating a decentralized stock exchange that would allow people to trade without the median party interfering. I got pretty far in the project but I had to table it to focus on other businesses. But Since now is a better time than any to introduce this, I will offer both the video explaining how it works and the foundational code of this project to hopefully build something for the people. I hope that this can be a community collaboration with this fellow community of developers to weigh in on how they wish this project to progress! If this gets a lot of support we can turn it into a foundation where the people contribute.\n\nThe Code: [https://github.com/tycooperaow/stock-dex](https://github.com/tycooperaow/stock-dex)\n\nThe Explainer Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcR-eGkItE0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcR-eGkItE0)\n\nMy Documented Journey before I tabled it: [https://twitter.com/tycooperaow/status/1210734095447117824](https://twitter.com/tycooperaow/status/1210734095447117824)\n\nMockup: [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENZucp4XYAAgjHk?format=jpg&amp;name=large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENZucp4XYAAgjHk?format=jpg&amp;name=large)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone would like to help to contribute to this project I am all for it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l7c7rx/as_more_and_more_people_are_restricted_from_their/,1,290
