kufw7i,1610290957,My Loss,"Posting with an alt account. \n\nI've been heavily involved in cryptocurrency since I discovered Bitcoin in 2013. \nI did a college presentation on it and my whole class were astounded by the idea. \nI invested all of my 8,000 savings into a Scrypt ASIC miner from KNCMiner. They take deposits, in full, pending shipping at a later date. They take 12 months before they finally ship. When they eventually do, they shipped a weaker chip, multiple users having high failure rates, no possibility of turning a profit with it.\nI joined a class action to help get a refund for it, hoping that European consumer laws would apply, unfortunately they didn't, and my hands were tied. I had no choice to sell it - I made back 15% of the price paid by selling it in ebay. \n\nI go back to my studies in Computer Science, graduate, have two beautiful kids and settle down with a job for a bit. \nFast forward to late 2016. I get back into the crypto world. Start reading here and there, putting in small amounts. Discovered Ethereum and put in whatever I had spare at the time (about 4k).\nI set a personal goal of 60k - enough to pay a mortgage down payment and pay off my loans. \nI take a little but of time off from work to trade more. \nAfter many many sleepless nights of trading, arbing, ICOs, I am nearly at the cashout goal that I initially set. I wake up one morning, I am literally on doing my business checking my phone for the latest prices - to my surprise Ethereum spiked during the night, I quickly go to check my address on Etherscan(just a thing I liked to do), to my absolute shock I see a transaction go through at 4am, I've never ran to the computer faster in my life. \nI checked over my address, checked token transactions, everything gone(about 50 Eth with tokens). My address was wiped clean - apart from one token(which was thankfully locked due to an ICO(REQ)), and a little bit of dust in alts. So, I try transferring in some eth to get the alt tokens out, the eth is immediately transfered out of my account(whoever compromised my address put a sweeper bot on it, making it nearly impossible to beat).\n - I never did find out exactly how I got hacked at the time. Obviously (And stupidly) not having a HW wallet was the main part of it( I got a one immediately after, obviously too late). I had received some calls from a Google Voice number a couple of days prior, didn't think much of it at the time. I also stupidly had remote desktop enabled on my computer for accessing the miners I had running in my house. \n \nThis loss was a big hit to my mental health. I struggled for a good while after that. \n\nI was desperate to recover the losses (I put back in the last 2k of my savings). Trading as much as I could, arbing whatever/wherever I could. I was happy, I was gaining back and confident I could recoup the loses from the hack - then WEX.nz happened. This one but hard, as the previous hack was still an open wound. \nWex.nz(formerly BTCe) had some nice arbitrage opportunities that I wanted( naively) to take advantage of. Suddenly withdrawals were disabled. The exchange still functioned for some time, allowing me to trade within that, I continued to trade, hoping that if crypto rises the exchange may enable withdrawals. Some months passed, the admins go quiet. There's chatter on Telegram channels that the exchange was sold to Dmitry Havchenko, a former Ukrainian entrepreneur turned separatist fighter.. ok, doesn't sound that bad... Fast forward another couple of months, WEX goes offline(domain shutdown because of the scan complaints). Now I realize there's no hope.. I go back to my career as a Software Developer for a short time. Fast forward to early 2019. I invest small bit of money that I saved up while working. I start reading on the side. Checking arbitrage opportunities here and there. Getting caught back into crypto, feeling sorry for myself again and trying to recoup past losses(fool me once right...), I see an arbitrage opportunity on BiteBTC (the name rang a bell, I remembered trading on it a small bit prior and not having any issues.). I try to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity and deposit whatever I had(5 Eth). Sure enough, withdrawals aren't processing - withdrawal gets cancelled. I wait for support... Fast forward a month or two, BiteBTC goes offline. I've lost hope for that one now. There's chatter on Telegram that BiteBTC is coming back as Fedlio.com(who claimed to be owned by Seychelles Commercial Bank - of course this turned out to be false claim). Fedlio comes online(and still is to this day- stay away!!!) and I am able to login with my old account. My account is ""pending verification"" - the only way to verify is to fill out the physical form with a copy of my ID and post to them in the Seychelles (not happening...). So I give up on that one. \n\n\nI've been scammed more times than I would like to admit at this stage. \n\nHere I am now watching Bitcoin breaking new highs, Ethereum thriving and very close to it's ATH and really itching to get back into cryptocurrency and still have 10k in debt. \n\n\nThanks if you've gotten this far. I've held off posting this for quite some time.\n\nJ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kufw7i/my_loss/,1,180
kug199,1610291427,Tracing Ethereum transactions,"It's not a secret that Ethereum blockchain is consistent and transparent for observation. From a side of trust this is wonderful, but what if you don't want to be identified while enjoy Ethereum opportunities? \n\nBitcoin blockchain is already became almost not anonymous due to such organizations as [AMLBot](https://t.me/cryptoaml_bot) and [Crystal](https://crystalblockchain.com). The approach to identify abstract user is simple:\n\n1. Find interested wallet\n2. Trace it till known exchange\n3. Request owner's personal data \n\nI have to say, that this is not such hard: known Blockchain tracers provide automated solutions to find the whole way of cryptocurrency from anonyms wallets to known entities (exchanges, custodial wallets etc.) and having some juridical power (e.g. intelligence services have) allow to request owner's personal data in just a week, whoop.. abstract wallet had became a concrete person.\n\nCrystal is already implementing tracing for Litecoin and Ethereum blockchains. Also, I want to admit [WhaleTrace](https://whaletrace.com) which is tracing and sending notifications about transactions in hundreds of blockchains following user determined parameters.\n\n**Don't you dare to think that Ethereum will become an open-book with actually no anonymity guarantees?**\n\nEven cross-blockchain swaps through [REN Protocol](https://renproject.io) won't drop tails if wrap, say, Bitcoin into Ethereum (wBTC) and reverse: do comply time and value between incoming transaction in blockchain A and outcoming transacation in blockchain B to continue tracing in another blockchain.\n\n**The solution:** r/BuccaneerV2 smart-contract on Ethereum. It have been developed in the middle 2020 and the core feature is that all transactions within the application goes hidden from Etherscan, while they actually written in Ethereum blockchain and share all its benefits such as decentralization and trustless. Every new transaction delete information about previous ones and constantly increase difficulty of identification.\n\nLiterally, no information about transactions, check it [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd5a7d515fb8b3337acb9b053743e0bc18f50c855) *all the transactions are interactions with transparent [Uniswap: BUCC Liquidity Pool](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x7772612549F27Aa49c83Fa59ab726f4799E4ecDc), but no BUCC transfers itself, no holders, no value... but they exist.\n\nMake your own judgement and choose wisely.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kug199/tracing_ethereum_transactions/,1,0

kugr7y,1610293760,Anybody else think it's funny when old-money investors say Bitcoin is early technology?,"I expect I'll get slapped around for sharing this opinion, but oh well.\n\nI read a lot about crypto, even more lately than usual, and of course I'm as excited about the run-ups lately as anyone else; however, I'm also seeing and hearing a lot of old-money people jumping into the space who seem to think that Bitcoin is ""very early technology"".  I just don't see it that way at all.  I'm not even going to look for the exact dates and times right now, but Bitcoin has been around a long, long time.  Ages in internet/tech years. I know it has some advances happening, but it looks nothing like the innovation happening around ethereum.\n\nIt's amusing, interesting, funny to a degree that old-money pouring into Bitcoin thinks it's in it's early stages of development.  Are they confusing Bitcoin with Ethereum?  I dunno.  Maybe.  I'm sure it's all good, but at the same time that I'm slightly amused about it, I'm a bit concerned.  While bitcoin has a massive presence and well-known descriptor, it just looks very stale and aged compared to what is happening in the Ethereum ecosystem and what we know is about to happen in coming years with Eth2.

kujjqz,1610302349,We're doing well so we should do more good...I have an idea for a charitable giving platform based on Ethereum.,"We've done well, so we should do good. If we can help charitable giving me more efficient we can increase the volume, which the world needs now!\n\n**I have an idea for a charitable giving platform based on Ethereum that would distribute funds to charitable organizations and track the impact using a Dapp.**\n\nI have a deep background in volunteerism and community support, and my wife is a senior leader in a local charity. As a human, I really love the idea of making an impact in people's lives who are less fortunate and it is hard to see folks suffering through problems that can be solved with just a bit of money. As a software engineer, I'm driven by efficiency, and it is hard to see how overall charities operate with very high overhead percentages. It's heartbreaking to see how resources are siphoned off, especially those directed toward initiatives in developing countries, by corruption.From a financial perspective, I have done well professionally, and well from blockchain and crypto investments. I think as a broader community, especially now we have done well and we should do good.\n\nHere's the problem - charitable organizations add substantial value in moving resources that people don't need to people who need them deeply. As a donor, you almost never see a direct impact (unless you are giving enormous sums of money). This feels like an absolute perfect fit for a distributed app and platform.\n\nDonors benefit because they can see their donation making an impact, with traceability all the way down to the end (a person receiving food assistance and scanning a QR code on their smartphone, or perhaps a group building a school or digging a well in a needy community). Charities would benefit because a platform like this would attract folks who want to give but want to see their impact in a transparent, traceable way, and they would even out their cash flow because they would get paid for performance as they scale. Charities are also deeply incentivized to perform according to the plan because if they can't, the unused portion of the donation is returned to the donor (or platform).\n\nConsider a food assistance charity.*Today the conversation is:***Donor:** Can you scale to give 1000 more meals a day?**Charity**: Yes, and here's our credible plan.Donor gives the money to the charity, and hopefully all goes according to plan.\n\n*With this platform:***Donor:** Can you scale to give 1000 more meals a day?**Charity**: Yes, and here's our credible plan.**Donor:** Uses the platform to create a smart contract using the Dapp.**Happy Path - Charity:** Distributes 1000 meals, and folks scan a QR code when they receive according to the rules set on the platform). Charity receives their defined, reasonable overhead percentage, and the impact is received by folks in need.**Struggling Charity:** We couldn't scale up far enough, we only distributed 200 meals. This is not an issue, the smart contract fulfills 20% of the payoff and then the rest can be used to help an organization that is ready to scale and make an impact today.\n\n**For now, I welcome perspectives and discussion. If you have a nonprofit or software development background and would like to help move this forward, reach out. Do you think you or your friends be likely to give if a platform like this existed \[this does not exist in any form other than an idea today, but if you read this far, please give a little piece of some of your gains to an organization you care about and share in the comments with your donation amount, so we can make an impact RIGHT NOW! \]**",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kujjqz/were_doing_well_so_we_should_do_more_goodi_have/,2,6
