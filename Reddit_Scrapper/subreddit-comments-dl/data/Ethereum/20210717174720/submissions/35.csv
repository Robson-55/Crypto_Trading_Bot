h7pwsg,1591985452,Ethereum 2.0 staking &amp; centralized exchanges.,"If we look at other PoS networks, it's obvious that probably 30% or more ETH will end up being staked via Coinbase, Binance, Kraken etc.  Centralized exchanges are a risk to PoS networks.. But it's easier for the vast majority of technically illiterate and lazy holders to just leave their coins on the exchange and let them do all the work.\n\nWhat can devs and everyone else do to mitigate this? How do we incentivize people to NOT stake their ETH via a centralized exchange? Curious to hear what you guys think.\n\nThe only thing i can think of is simplifying the staking process down to the point where anyone can do it via multiple wallets/platforms with a couple clicks. All the leg work to becoming a validator should be abstracted out to the point where you simply deposit your 32 ETH into your wallet and click 'stake'.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/h7pwsg/ethereum_20_staking_centralized_exchanges/,3,6

h7vlch,1592004068,Building an app on Ethereum (this May be a stupid question),"Hi All,\n\nForgive me if this is a stupid question but I thought this was the best place for me to ask. \n\nI‚Äôve been a long time lurker in the crypto space having been involved in 2013/14 mining dogecoin for fun and then getting involved again in 2017 where I made my first crypto purchases. \n\nI believe in crypto and blockchain long term and now really want to immerse myself in the technology by taking on a project and a practise use case. \n\nI‚Äôd like to try and learn to code a dapp - specifically one that works just like a signature (I‚Äôm pretty sure a dapp for this exists already, but I wanted to pick a use case that would solve an actual problem I encounter), I‚Äôd like to try and build something that works as a digital signature for signing contracts, or a way of verifying contracts that runs on the blockchain. \n\nIf I wanted to get started doing this, where would be the best place to start? I‚Äôm a business guy and my coding knowledge is limited to some seriously basic html, but I‚Äôd like to give this a go - not super worried if it takes me 2 years to learn, 10 years to learn or if I never finish it at all, I just want to jump in and learn a bit more about the space and coding and thought that trying to build a dapp would be a good way to start. \n\nIf anyone had any suggestions or advice I would absolutely welcome it and if this is a stupid question then please feel free to ignore!\n\nCheers for your time everyone",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/h7vlch/building_an_app_on_ethereum_this_may_be_a_stupid/,3,4

h7yt7d,1592015572,Issue when sending offline. 2.5 ETH lost?,"I was attempting to perform a offline send of a ERC20 token form my wallet.  I was following instructions here: [https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/offline/offline\_transaction/](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/offline/offline_transaction/) On  that page it says: ""Excess gas will be refunded, so don‚Äôt be afraid to  raise it as high as 100,000"".\n\nThe first time I tried to perform this  transaction I got a error that said ""intrinsic gas too low"".  I googled  that error and found this page: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MyEtherWallet/comments/9eac0o/intrinsic\_gas\_too\_low/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MyEtherWallet/comments/9eac0o/intrinsic_gas_too_low/)  and saw this: ""the problem was not the Gwei price (4 Gwei was plenty)  but the gas limit  default of 21000.  Raised to 50000 and it went  through immediately""\n\nSo  I thought what could go wrong if I set the gas limit and gas price to  be 50,000 since I thought and extra fee would be refunded to me.  The  transaction failed, and I am now missing 2.5 ETH from my wallet.  Is  there anything I can do to get this back?  I think I am SOL, but I  thought it wouldn't hurt to ask.  This is a truncated screenshot of my  transaction: [https://imgur.com/a/HH4Pnuu](https://imgur.com/a/HH4Pnuu)\n\n\*\*Edit\*\* I reached out to the pool that mined the block to see if they can help.
