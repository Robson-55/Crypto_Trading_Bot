lnaz93,1613723664,Can somebody please counter-argue this point regarding governance token vulnerability.,"First and foremost I understand the benefits of a voting system and love the idea of governance tokens. I am just curious about vectors for attack.\n\nGovernance tokens are tokens that developers create to allow token holders to help shape the future of a protocol. Governance token holders can influence decisions concerning the project such as proposing or deciding on new feature proposals and even changing the governance system itself.\n\nI want to pose a hypothetical. What would prevent a bad actor/s with disposable capital from buying a controlling amount of governance tokens and then using said tokens to prevent a protocol's innovation. \n\nWhy you may ask? Let's hypothesize that said bad actors own a competing protocol. They buy a large enough quantity of their competitor's governance tokens to prevent said protocol from innovating. This would inevitably lead to that protocol's demise. Less competition, more users for their protocol.\n\nTokens can be bought by those with the most money. Decision-making power is being given to those who can pay for it. Does this not lead us to inevitably be exploited by the same unfair system we experience today? The few guide the many. This is aristocratic in nature which is strictly against the ideals of a decentralized system.\n\nIs this not an issue?\n\nThis thought experiment came to me in part from watching people debate for and against EIP-1559. Those against EIP-1559 seem to care more about profits rather than the health of the network.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lnaz93/can_somebody_please_counterargue_this_point/,1,6

lndfkg,1613733110,"An underrated project with valuation $86,400 on the NFT market. x1000 is real?"," \n\nI found project CyberTime Finance. The team creates the NFT Fantasy League platform. The project documentation says that tokens will be listed on the Uniswap exchange with the following prices:\n\nNFTL - $ 0.001 (total tokens = 86,400,000)\n\nCTF - $ 1 (total tokens = 86,400)\n\nIt turns out that at the start of trading, the valuation of both tokens will be $86,400\n\nThere will be no pre-sale, IEO. Tokens will be distributed through farming for 7 days. This is very unusual, but interesting for an NFT project. I found the design of their future farming platform. Very similar to the basis.cash concept. They also carried out farming. So, in the first few days, the mcap of the governance token (BCS) reached $500M.\n\nLet's imagine about what might happen to the CyberTime $CTF token during farming:\n\nPrice $CTF = 10$ - Market cap - $864,000 - x10\n\nPrice $CTF = 100$ - Market cap - $8,640,000 - x100\n\nPrice $CTF = 1000$ - Market cap - $86,400,000 - x1000\n\nWho knows, maybe the token will soar and above $100M, but I have little faith in it. And from time to time, the valuation will stabilize in the range of $1M-$10M, until the team releases a full-fledged product. But the fact that on the hype of farming, the estimate can test $30M - $50M and even $80M, I have no doubt. There is a lot of news around the NFT market right now:\n\n* [Early CryptoPunk Digital Collectible Sells for $762K in Ether](https://www.coindesk.com/early-cryptopunk-digital-collectible-sells-for-762k-in-ether)\n* [Forbes wrote an article on the NFT market and the first NFT auction on Christieâ€™s](http://forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2021/02/16/from-crypto-to-christies-how-beeple-put-digital-art-on-the-map-and-then-catalyzed-its-market/)\n* [NFT marketplace Rarible raises $1.75 million in seed funding round](https://coinmarketcap.com/ru/headlines/news/nft-marketplace-rarible-raises-1-75-million-in-seed-funding-round/)\n* [Rare Hashmasks Digital Artwork Sells for $650K in Ether](https://www.coindesk.com/artwork-ethereum-hashmask-650k)\n\nTherefore, I will follow the project with interest.
