I expect that ETH will reach its ATH around the end of December, but I also think that at the beginning of 2021, it will fall again until 2.0 is released. I'm thinking about taking profits in December, but if you guys think ETH is going to do some wild things in January/February of 2021 as well, I might consider waiting.\n\nI would love to hear your opinions about it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jzdu17/eth_december_ath/,1,17

jzgvlj,1606135260,A concern regarding eth1 client centralisation,I am not an ethereum expert so I would love to be rebuked in the comments.\n\nA lot has been said about running a minority eth2 client. I am going to monitor the clients people are using and make sure I am always running a minority one like a good ethitizen. BUT... all the guides I read recommended using geth for eth1 data supply. This is really concerning as if geth goes down eth2 will stop finalising and all eth2 clients will rapidly be losing money and spinning another eth1 client node will take forever to sync.\n\nWe can do more as a community to promote non-geth clients for eth1 data endpoints.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jzgvlj/a_concern_regarding_eth1_client_centralisation/,1,3

More on-hand capital (e.g. capital to pay for utilities such as electricity and hardware) allows for greater chance of mining blocks and verification\n\nEthereum = PoW moving to Proof of Stake (PoS) with ETH 2.0. More ETH ‚Äústaked‚Äù greater chance of verification and subsequent return. Requires more ‚Äúskin in game‚Äù as any illicit activity results in fines and/or loss of stake \n\n\nCoins ‚Äúon‚Äù other Chain:\n\nBitcoin = $0 ETH on BTC chain\n\nEthereum = $700M BTC (WBTC) on ETH chain \n\n\nJust remember, first to market does not always mean the best or most likely to succeed. BTC has its financial utility, but ETH has a wider variety of utility and an evolving framework.
