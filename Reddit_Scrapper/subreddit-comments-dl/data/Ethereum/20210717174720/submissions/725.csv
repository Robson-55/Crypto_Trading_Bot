Any technical or reality issue that could lead the improvement to fail? What are the things that will be limiting or holding PoW to PoS back?\n2) If improvement and algorithmized burnt fees are expected, shouldn‚Äôt it be lesser miners now? As the transition will cause them to only earn from getting Eth after mining (compared with the current miner fees)?\n3) What if there‚Äôs a 51% attack?\n\nOpen to more discussion in the comment section so we can go through from the same thread.\n\nTIA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nmq1uq/discussion_limitation_what_could_go_wrong/,1,3

nmr9l3,1622182156,üòä Turn your loyalty points into cryptocurrency with DragonBite,"Dragonbite - Turn your idle reward points into cryptocurrency \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone knows that loyalty programs help attract more customers to the store that is why they are so popular. They help to shop to increase its revenue. At the same time, loyalty programs are profitable to customers, as they help to significantly save money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll stores have their own loyalty programs, there is no unified system of loyalty programs, different stores are not interconnected. It is impossible to send the unused points to other users inside the loyalty program of one shop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCustomers often do not have enough accumulated points to buy the necessary goods. They can't buy missing points or sell extra points. All received points are often lost, because they burn up over time and the person does not have time to use them or acommulate them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDragonBite was created to solve all these problems. DragonBite is a platform that allows people to combine, store and swap loyalty programs on one platform. You will never lose your accumulated points under the loyalty program of a particular store.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you don't need the points you have, you can sell them. If you need more points to pay for the product you are interested in, you can buy points from those who have extra ones or exchange them for points from another shop. You will never lose your loyalty points with DragonBite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDragonBite is a truly open, decentralized asset management platform for loyalty programs of various stores in one app with one password!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDragonBite's vision is to disrupt the loyalty market with innovative business models and technologies. You will no longer lose your points. Thanks to DragonBite it became possible to buy, sell and exchange loyalty points.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚úÖ Since 2018  DragonBite has been working on a Loyalty program.\n\n‚úÖ Around 50,000 merchants  have joined the platform.\n\n‚úÖ 1M people use the platform.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA huge user base and a large number of partner stores allow us to unite the most profitable loyalty programs in one place and provide our users the best conditions, significantly reducing their costs. With our experience and user and merchant customer base, we are ready to solve all problems of loyalty programs!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nüëâ Our advantages\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚úÖ  A Digital wallet in one app with one password.\n\nDragonBite is a digital wallet to safely store several kinds of digital assets, including Cryptocurrencies, In-game assets, Air mileages, Loyalty points, E-vouchers, E-coupons and Gift cards, in One application with One password. It is a fully integrated and decentralised financial services system, which is designed for digital assets management.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚úÖ   Loyalty worth a fortune. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n90% of companies have some sort of loyalty [programs.In](https://programs.In) fact, the redemption rate of loyalty programs is just 7%, most people do not know the value of their loyalty points. Users of the platform will be able to spend their unused points to pre-pay DragonBite cards for daily consumption in real life. Customers can spend their expiring points to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚úÖ Turn your loyalty points into cryptocurrency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have loyalty points expire soon or a small number of air mileage or any old in-game asset, you can convert those digital assets into Bitcoin with a very reasonable transaction fee.

It is compliant with compliance rules such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &amp; the Personal Data Privacy Ordinance (PDPO), the Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) standard and the Know-Your-Client (KYC) standard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚úÖ DragonBite is technology advances!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDragonBite is directly connected with Crypto Exchange via a licensed payment gateway. It is powered by a hybrid IT architecture, that is partly on-chain and partly off-blockchain. BITE Point is our universal loyalty token, acting as a medium of exchange among digital assets. It is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. DragonBite will deploy Non-Fungible Token (NFT) to handle rare assets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚úÖ Travel even more with DragonBite!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone has been staying at home since early 2020 and their air miles are expiring. DragonBite offers a new method to spend air miles.

nmu5ve,1622195030,I have an idea - and can't stop thinking about it. Perhaps you could help?,"Long story short. \n\nA great spot has opened in my city for a coffee place. I run a software company and am busy most of the time, but have the capital to invest in the rent, machinery, stock, salaries, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I am an ETH believer and HODLER, and want to start building real cases for it. One of the most interesting concepts of ETH is for sure DAOs to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am running businesses for almost 10 years and organisations decay thanks to ego, politics and other unproductive BS. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to set up a DAO Coffee Spot. Where every member that works there is an owner, gets a cut of the sales. That way we can set up a fully autonomous coffee shop and brand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order for me to push this forward and commit to the 5 year lease I want to have a clear understanding of the implementation and setup of the DAO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy (Big Ask) to any ETH believer and fellow DAO lover is for some help setting up the base concepts of this organisation. I am very willing to publish the whole setup and reflection for the community. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any other ideas on how to make this happen, please let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope you have a great day, and that you dig this initiative.
