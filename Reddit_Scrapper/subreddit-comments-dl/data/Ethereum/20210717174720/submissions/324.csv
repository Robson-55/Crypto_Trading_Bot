Can't someone borrow USDC and buy DAI and supply it and gain %12(DAI supply interest rate)-7.5%(USDC supply interest rate)=4=5% interest on it?

l3sg6l,1611462591,How Polkadot project StaFi brings liquidity to staked assets like DOT and ETH2,"Massive amounts of capital are locked in staked crypto assets. But a relatively new platform is making those markets both tradeable and liquid.\n\nEnter StaFi\n\nStaFi, founded in 2020 and built on Polkadot, is among the first-ever decentralized protocols that help unlock the liquidity of staked assets via its own platform. This means users can stake their proof of stake (PoS) tokens (which are untradable until they are staked) and get a “rToken” (reward-Token) in return.\n\nThese rTokens enable users to both get the staking reward and trade the locked staking token at the same time. “You can stake your PoS tokens through Staking Contracts built by StaFi,” the team said in a post, adding:\n\n“All you have to do is use the tools to stake your PoS tokens, and you’ll receive rToken in return which can be exchanged and traded on DEXes and CEXes in the near future, as well as integrated in other DeFi protocols.”\n\nStaFi developers had earlier launched rETH, a solution to the liquidity of ETH2.0 staking, with the help of community contributors. This opened the gates for the nearly $3.3 billion locked in ETH 2.0 to be tokenized, liquified, and traded.\n\n\n\nRead Full on: [https://cryptoslate.com/how-polkadot-project-stafi-brings-liquidity-to-staked-assets-like-eth2/](https://cryptoslate.com/how-polkadot-project-stafi-brings-liquidity-to-staked-assets-like-eth2/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l3sg6l/how_polkadot_project_stafi_brings_liquidity_to/,1,3
