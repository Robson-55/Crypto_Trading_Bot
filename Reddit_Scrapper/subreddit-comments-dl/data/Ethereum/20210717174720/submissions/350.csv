A neutral place that doesn‚Äôt filter, censor or stop any drawing. A place for true freedom of speech through art.\n\nMurAll requires the PAINT token to draw on it - a fixed supply ERC-20 token analogous with real-life paint; you can't take paint off a wall and reuse it once it's on there, and similarly any PAINT used during drawing is burned as part of the transaction thus preventing it from being reused.\n\nWhen you draw on the MurAll canvas, you also get a MURALL Non-Fungible Token (NFT) of your contribution, a token containing your drawing, which you own and are free to do with as you please - hold, display, trade, collect, the choice is yours.\n\n**Here's the exciting part:** If you are an owner of an ERC-721 NFT or have created blockchain art before (Known Origin/Rarible/SuperRare/Async Art) then **you are eligible for an AIRDROP**!\n\nThere is only enough supply of PAINT to allow MurAll to be drawn over in it's entirety a maximum of 21 thousand times, meaning MurAll has a finite lifespan; **once PAINT runs out you won‚Äôt be able to draw on MurAll again**.\n\nGo check out MurAll at [https://murall.art/](https://murall.art/)\n\nor join our Discord [https://discord.gg/c5U9Cb6PAU](https://discord.gg/c5U9Cb6PAU) where you can chat with the team directly.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions you may have!\n\n**TLDR:** MurAll is a new on-chain collaborative art project and you may be eligible to claim free tokens!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lb4afo/murall_a_new_onchain_art_project_just_launched/,6,3
