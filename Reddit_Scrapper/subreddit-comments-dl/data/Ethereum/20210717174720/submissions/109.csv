I am a year until crypto trading and first I used Robin hood, then coin base, the voyager, then a few other exchanges. I have a ledger now. But I feel like there has to be a better way to do this. I feel like markets surge...I want to sell...but it takes me so long to transfer all my crypto around until I can sell. Then Its like all the exchanges wont let you sell everything so unless you use their exchange again you lose like .17 cause they wont let you withdraw it.  I made a metamask account to move some stuff through uniswap and now metamask wont let me purge the account and there is $10 just there. I cant send it anywhere.\n\nHelp.

Like even coinbases wallet is non-custodial and doesn't require personal information to create, so where are they sending this 1099 tax form to and how does the IRS even know how much you have or had in your ""wallet""?\n\n Sorry I might be totally off base and confused... my bad if I am",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/i9hjpa/confusion_about_kyc_and_crypto_reporting_to_the/,1,8
