kmh0vl,1609257670,Unpopular Opinion: ETH needs to be simple to understand if you want adoption any time soon.,"The advantages that DEFI and smart contracts have for the leveling up of our society are undeniable, but most people aren't technically profficient enough for it to be practical for them. \n\nIn my own layman's opinion, the best way to approach this is to incentivize businesses to use smart contracts. Doing business over blockchain would help shift crypto from being a highly volitile asset that most people only hold hoping for profit, to a store of value that is actually logical to exchange hands. \n\nI think adoption on the firm level must come before general population. There is no reason for 99.9% of people to have eth if they can't pay bills, shop online, or buy groceries with eth. \n\nAlso, eth needs to be usable for people who don't understand computers and networks on a deep level .... Because most people don't.\n\nAre there any projects going on that are using eth to create business applications?\n\nSorry for grammer I am on mobile",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kmh0vl/unpopular_opinion_eth_needs_to_be_simple_to/,1,51
