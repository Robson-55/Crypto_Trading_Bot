nainva,1620803105,The pro of high gas costs,"Ethereum's high gas prices have been a very common headline on every social media corner for many many months now, and I agree they make DeFi hard.\n\nBut really just think about it, look at BSC and its ultra cheap fees, the network is becoming a joke by day due to the hilarious amount of sh\*tcoins launching on it for almost nothing every minute, which is also scaring institutions away from them.\n\nIMHO, Ethereum's high network gas fees are, after all, a good thing during this super-inflated bubbly bull-run and sh\*t-coin era. These fees are saving Ethereum's ecosystem from projects without use or vision and making it an actual valuable one.\n\nSo, until mass crypto education comes and the crypto communities start putting up and advertising some principles and standards, high gas fees are making Ethereum the sustainable, long term play.\n\nJust my two cents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nainva/the_pro_of_high_gas_costs/,1,31
naiqeo,1620803430,Cheapest fees for transferring ETH to cold wallet?,"Not sure of the etiquette here, but I am looking to buy ETH and send it to my cold wallet for long term HODL but goddamn the fees are ridiculous I bought some a few days ago and I feel like I lost almost 50% due to transfer fees. Anybody know of any exchange where I can buy ETH and then send it to my cold wallet for reasonable fees?? I am not looking to transfer it into a a different coin, just send ETH directly to cold storage without paying outrageous fees.

naizxa,1620804611,What is a realistic potential price for ethereum?,"Hi Guys I hope some of you can enlighten me, I read a lot of blogs of people saying that ETH could reach 50k or even 150k usd in the future, but is it really true?\n\nI checked on coin perspective and if ETH reaches the same market cap of BTC its value would be around 9.3k but I don't think the price takes the deflation that eip 1559 is going to bring, also I am not sure how the eth 2.0 is going to impact the price too. \n\nDoes anyone know the math for the price, (e.g. market cap/coin in circulation or other variable) so that we can have a realistic ETH potential price? please don't answer with your sentiments but just numbers, thanks to whom will answer.\n\nTDLR' looking for a realistic model to calculate eth future price based on the market cap after the future updates",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/naizxa/what_is_a_realistic_potential_price_for_ethereum/,1,4

naker6,1620810946,Canadian newb trying to choose an exchange,"So I understand, well, the basics of crypto. Sorta. But in practice I am still foggy in a few areas. \n\nI already picked out a wallet; I went with Guarda due to the flexibility, it having a desktop wallet, and it being open source. I chose against mycrypto and MEW due to that apparent developer spat back when; seems hard to know if either went shady\n\nNow I have to get set up on an exchange. I don't intend to blow life savings on this; just a few hundred for now. Probably gonna buy some ETH, stick it in a wallet, and forget about it. Now, with my being in Canada, which exchange can people recommend that I use? Speed of setup, low fees, and security are obviously my priorities. I am kinda loathe to use Binance as they are headquarted in China; I don't consider them to be trustworthy as a result, given the CCP is... aggressive in their policies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, feedback and help is appreciated; hopefully I can learn and be more adept at this",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/naker6/canadian_newb_trying_to_choose_an_exchange/,1,10
