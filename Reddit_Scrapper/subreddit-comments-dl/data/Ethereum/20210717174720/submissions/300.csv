kvud93,1610467242,My cousin is getting crazy because he ‚Äûlost‚Äú money on ethereum. What advise do you have for him?,"Long story short, I bought $8k in crypto in 2017; tried to be a trader and lost 3k. That‚Äòs about my story with crypto. After that I got payed in crypto once, but lost my phone and together with it went my 800 bucks in secrypto. Now I only watch the market. \n\nMy cousin is a guy who likes to invest in a lot of get-rich-quick schemes. He already called me many times asking for advice on deals he lost a lot of money on. He bought a taxi fleet right before covid-19. I don‚Äòt know why he calls me whenever he‚Äòs in trouble. I am a designer, not a financial advisor. \n\nHe has now invested 36k in ethereum. He didn‚Äòt know anything about crypto before and apparently that kind of money is a lot of money to him, because he is going nuts asking me 10 times a day what‚Äòs my opinion on it, when will ETH go up, etc. It‚Äòs all very naive. \n\nHe ‚Äûlost‚Äú 5k so far. I told him not to sell. Just relax and keep the coins. Ethereum is a solid project. ‚ÄûNo, man, it‚Äòll not go to 0‚Äú. Still, he keeps asking me to ask experts (I‚Äòve worked for Credit Suisse and have a couple on friends in finance, but they don‚Äòt do crypto). \n\nSo what do you guys have to say to a guy who seems to be very naive and emotional about his investments? Please say anything Ethereum related. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kvud93/my_cousin_is_getting_crazy_because_he_lost_money/,1,29
