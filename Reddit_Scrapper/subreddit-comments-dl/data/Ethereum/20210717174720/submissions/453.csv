m2cg9b,1615419749,Can someone please help me out here?,I have like 3-4 transactions in Que or Pending in MetaMask and I cant do anything with them I've looked up videos on what to do and i've tried to update the nonce with more gas (even though i've set it to fast gas option everytime.) And I cant do it because of the fact that [Etherscan.IO](https://Etherscan.IO) doesn't show that theres a transaction yet. But nothing is going through. Will I lose all of the ETH in this wallet due to this? Like since theres not very much ETH in the wallet will I lose whatever is in there after the gas comes out for the next transaction to ATTEMPT to be processed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/m2cg9b/can_someone_please_help_me_out_here/,1,7

m2ezg5,1615427267,PHUCK BABY BOOMERS,"[PHUCK BABY BOOMERS: The NFT to define a generation.](https://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:365599:0x4d9c6f7980965d31e92e60d89d860acf034ba128)\n\nBaby boomers (often shortened to boomers) are the demographic cohort following the Silent Generation and preceding Generation X. The generation is generally defined as people born from 1946 to 1964, during the post–World War II baby boom.  Baby boomers are often parents of late Gen Xers and Millennials.  Arguably the worst generation in human history, boomers have been responsible for the following: \n\n* The worst economic recession since the Great Depression \n* Jim Cramer \n* Two of the three largest transfers of wealth from the working class to the top 1.00% in American history.  These two events were the 2008 stock market crash and the Covid-19 pandemic. \n* The greatest gap in income equality in American history. \n* All-time high CEO pay with all other wages remaining stagnant \n* The Covid-19 pandemic. \n* Staying in jobs longer because they failed to secure a retirement, thus keeping younger generations out of the workforce and unable to start their adult lives. \n* A 300% rise in college tuition costs. A 6.8% daily compounding student loan interest rate and over $1.71 trillion in student loan debt crippling an entire generation. \n* Passage of the Controlled Substances Act which turned drug use and addiction into a criminal problem rather than a public health crisis disproportionately affecting minorities. \n* Four out of the top five longest running wars in American History surpassing only the war that fucking founded the country. \n* Ronald Reagan, whose failed economic plan is responsible for some of the above atrocities, not to mention his ramping up of the War on Drugs with the ultimate ignorant statement, ""Just Say No"". \n* The birth of Helicopter Parents, who prevent kids from freely hanging out around the neighborhood because they've instilled the fear that they will be kidnapped, raped, and or murdered, despite the statistical fact that these are all far more likely to be perpetuated by family or a family friend. \n* The highest divorce rate of any generation. \n* The creation of the 24-hour news network/propaganda machine. \n* The lowest rated Congress in recorded history. \n* Oh, and did I mention, Jim Cramer…\n\nDespite a proven track record of doing the most to be the worst, boomers continue to believe that “they gave their children a better life than they had.”  Unable to even contemplate considering their shortcomings, the average boomer is riddled with the “holier-than-thou” attitude. They were set up for success by their parents and the thriving state of the world economy, they changed the rules at their own discretion to maximize their greed, and they had a total disregard for the passing the baton of the environmental and fiscal state of the world to their offspring.  Perhaps the worst characteristic embodied by the boomers is the constant harassment about how lazy young’uns are nowadays and how easy it is to make money.  They didn’t leave the world a better place than when they inherited it.  Millennials will.\n\n**“Phuck Baby Boomers”:** When looking at this piece, a boomer is likely to respond by saying “I could have made this on Microsoft Paint” or “I can just screenshot this”.  These responses highlight a fundamental boomer problem, their inability to embrace the new.  What the boomer cannot grasp is by purchasing a token, you actually acquiring the only verifiable version of that piece as minted by the artist. Thanks to the blockchain, once an artist mints a work, all other copies of said art are just that, copies…One must appreciate “Phuck Baby Boomers” for what it is, a defining piece of art history.  A transfer of the baton from one generation to the next.  An ode to the fuckery embodied by boomers whose actions will be paid for by several generations to come.  The sale of this NFT is intended to accomplish one thing above all else, piss off boomers.   [This historic piece is conservatively priced at 420.69 ETH.
