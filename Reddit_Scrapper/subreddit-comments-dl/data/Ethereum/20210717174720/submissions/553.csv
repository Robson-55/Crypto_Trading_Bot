mx3w7v,1619208406,How to change seed phrase for wallet without transferring coins out of it (gas prohibitive to move them)?,I have a relative who has a wallet that needs to have the seed change. It was exposed. The only reason the coins weren't taken yet is the gas fee will eat up most of the ERC-20 token's value. How could he change the seed to secure the wallet again without having to move the coins off?  \n\nbonus question- what is the cheapest bridge out there to move coins from metamask to another Level 2 with ultra low fees?
