h7zrse,1592019339,How might one wrap BTC in ETH,"I‚Äôve been thinking about this issue for a while, then when Gavin Andreessen made his [post](https://mobile.twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/1271561026199261185)  I started thinking about it a lot more.\n\nBy definition you can‚Äôt store secrets on a smart contract which would be necessary to store the wallet keys. \n\nCryptography is likely the answer, though it raises the issue of how to decrypt the cryptic text. Perhaps the system can make use the encrypted info without decrypting it? I don‚Äôt know how it would work though.\n\nOne idea might be to use multi signature keys ([see here for more on this](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/12/26/secret-sharing-daos-crypto-2-0/)) this however is impractical, as it doesn‚Äôt account for the shifting number of ethereum nodes.\n\nThe most viable solution is to have contract make calls to a place outside of the ethereum chain. This raises the issue of trust.\n\nIn conclusion I don‚Äôt think it is possible, though I am interested in hearing better ideas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/h7zrse/how_might_one_wrap_btc_in_eth/,1,5

I've googled it but can only find some experiments, or advisory prediction markets - nothing where the allocation is fully decided by the market.
