n6kr5b,1620343508,Is it possible to have a permissioned sidechain on a permissionless mainchain?,"Or am I misunderstanding something? Just thinking of ways to synthesize the two, ways Ethereum could eventually fulfill the roles of a permissioned blockchain network, without compromising its wider permissionlessness.\n\nIf the above is impossible, is there any other way that a section of Ethereum could be centralized, within a generally decentralized blockchain?\n\nThis is one of Gary Gensler's main points in his MIT course so far: trying to get the students to realistically assess the business use-cases for permissioned and permissionless blockchains. He cites the/a Australian stock exchange (?; haven't investigated directly) as an example of a permissioned blockchain, and argues that there are reasons that a business, or even a central bank, may value a permissioned blockchain as a business model.\n\nSo really this question is a hinge for my tentative Ethereum maximalism. If there is a way that Ethereum could cater to parties who would prefer a centralized, permissioned arrangement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n6kr5b/is_it_possible_to_have_a_permissioned_sidechain/,1,3

n6mkv2,1620349176,FORCED KYC for a Crypto Wallet and Account ???,"= Electroneum\n\nSo...Im over in the r/electroneum reddit and i see that people can NOT get access to their ETN in their accounts because they have to do KYC for their, from what I understand, Wallet.\n\nNot exchange, but their WALLET.\n\nSo, I ask, creating this thread :\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Electroneum/comments/n5vq7q/why\_is\_electroneum\_asking\_for\_kyc\_for\_a\_wallet/gx3wpd0/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Electroneum/comments/n5vq7q/why_is_electroneum_asking_for_kyc_for_a_wallet/gx3wpd0/?context=3)\n\nThe mod over at r/Electroneum ended up closing the thread that I posted asking why, and sent me this link as to why :\n\n[https://support.electroneum.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360009862537-What-is-KYC-AML-CTF-](https://support.electroneum.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360009862537-What-is-KYC-AML-CTF-)\n\nIt contains excerpts like this :\n\n""Can‚Äôt you just stop with all this boring stuff and just give me access to my account?""\n\nThis might be boring and frustrating for some but as you can see it is very important and we take the protection of the ETN Community and the ETN ecosystem VERY seriously.\n\nNo one individual is more important than the ETN Community as a whole and so we have to protect all of us, even if that means potentially becoming unpopular with some of us.\n\nSorry, but this is how it has to be. No exceptions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeres another one :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""Your processes are way over the top, and excessive. My friend has a wallet with someone else and he doesn‚Äôt have any hassle getting into his account.""\n\nUnderstood, but let‚Äôs look at this for the security of your ETN account. We base it on global standards set out by global organisations, for global implementation, namely:\n\nThe Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG) is a private sector body that is made up of the leading UK Trade Associations in the financial services industry.\n\nThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog.\n\nHave a look, you can see very clearly what they say ‚ÄúGood‚Äù looks like. If your friend's wallet isn‚Äôt putting this in place, he should think again. This is global. That means everyone should be doing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGo read the rest of the reasons that they give.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm posting this because i want to know how you guys in this forum feels about it.\n\nI dont like it and ive protested it.\n\nI havent been banned (yet) but maybe im over reacting.\n\nMaybe im wrong.\n\nYou can still see my responses and again, maybe im wrong.\n\nBut im asking for everyone elses opinion on this over several crypto reddit threads because maybe its me. Maybe im missing something.\n\nMaybe Electroneum is justified.\n\nBut for me, it seems like its centralized and controlling, just like a typical bank, the very thing were trying ot get away from hence DE Centralization.\n\nThe irony is, that, i believe they were a fork of....\n\nMONERO",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n6mkv2/forced_kyc_for_a_crypto_wallet_and_account/,1,5
