gtnpx7,1590879264,Is there a way for Dapp developers to mine their user's transactions so they don't need to pay for gas?,"Hi r/ethereum, I was wondering if anyone found any solutions to making users not have to pay for gas. As we try to build products for people that are beyond Web3, one big barrier to entry we're all aware of is gas costs that our users need to handle. One way I was brainstorming about was if you could mine transactions for transactions specific to your contracts. Is this possible?\n\nBelow I'll outline the problems, goals, and previously known solutions to align thoughts.\n\n# 1. Problems\n\n**Long Mining Times** \- A common pain point I've been seeing is that users will submit transactions and find that their transaction has been mining for over 20 minutes or more. \n\n**Flaky Transaction Finality** \- There's no guarantee that a user's transaction will ever complete \n\n**Not User Friendly To New Users** \- Handling gas has been a significant barrier to entry for new users who aren't familiar with Web3 products. Ideally what we build should conform to the user's expectations and not the other way around.\n\n# 2. Goals\n\n**Seamless Experience** \- Users shouldn't need to worry about gas and have a high degree of certainty that their transaction will go through.\n\n**Not Over-Engineered** \- The solution should not aim to be an over engineered effort that will add more dev work, act as a mental exercise rather than a solution viable for production, and add tech debt in the long run.\n\n# 3. Previously Known Solutions\n\n**Meta-Transactions** \- This pushes the transaction cost to the Dapp developer, so it has a decent trade off that cannot be ignored, especially during peak hours.\n\n**Gas Token** \- Reduces gas costs but users still need to worry about paying gas fees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurious if any of you have any insight to a solution. It doesn't need to be restricted to mining your own transactions as long as it helps users not have to worry about gas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/gtnpx7/is_there_a_way_for_dapp_developers_to_mine_their/,1,0
