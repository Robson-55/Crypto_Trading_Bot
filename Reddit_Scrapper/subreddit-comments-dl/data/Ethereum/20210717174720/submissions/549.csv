mwixfg,1619137603,$XCEL,"XCel is an automated market maker (AMM) aggregator and yield farming solution providing decentralised loans secured through XCel on Binance Smart Chain. The project was created to improve the availability of credit on BSC, as we felt the options for decentralised loans were limited within the BSC ecosystem when compared to Ethereum.\n\n* Decentralized yield farming (at launch)\n* Flash loans, backed by staked assets with profits of loans distributed to XCel holders (post audit)\n* NFT's used to facilitate ownership of P2P asset backed loans (long term directional goal)\n\nNO PRESALE, NO AIRDROP, NO BULLSHIT\n\nAs I write this $XCel currently has 44 holders with the plan for natural growth and demand unlike other shitcoins which has then caused many to lose money.

mwjzpt,1619141089,Trouble withdrawing from DeFi App using Ledger,"I originally this in r/ledgerwaller but there's about 2 people on that sub.\n\nI'm having trouble withdrawing from Yearn using my newly purchased Ledger Nano X. Previous to the Ledger I held Yearn Finance's custom tokens (e.g. yvUSDC, yvWETH) in my MetaMask wallet. When I got the Ledger I transferred them over from the MetaMask. No problems here. I can now connect my Ledger when using [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance) and can view all my balances. (yay! - I love staring at them)\n\nI now want to withdraw from the Yearn vault. I connect my Ledger, select the asset I want to withdraw, select ""Max"", and click withdraw. Now the transaction pops up on the ledger and asks me to confirm. I scroll through the smart contract address, the gas fee, and the amount of ETH - but the amount of ETH is always 0. It's asking me to approve or reject withdrawing 0 ETH. I've tried withdrawing different amounts and always its 0 ETH on the ledger to approve. \n\nDo I need to use LedgerLive to approve the transactions too?\n\nAny help is appreciated. I'm closely monitoring gas prices to withdraw and deposit into another vault and have missed a few opportunities already.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mwjzpt/trouble_withdrawing_from_defi_app_using_ledger/,1,6
mwk2be,1619141323,Figuring out where I sent my Ethereum," I am doing 2017-2020 crypto taxes. I have mostly everything figured out except one big ETH address which I cannot find info on where it was sent or what it was exchanged for.\n\nBack in July of 2019, I withdrew 15 ETH from Gemini and sent it to the address: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xdc54fbfaed6eCb9b0de07cDfC9893800aD545719](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdc54fbfaed6eCb9b0de07cDfC9893800aD545719)\n\nFrom this address, it was transferred to this address:\n\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x7454a609ea877f37fa6d42feca76a8f18de841c7](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7454a609ea877f37fa6d42feca76a8f18de841c7)\n\nThe second address has 28k+ transactions. It seems like this might be some exchange, and the first txid transaction was for taking out a fee?\n\nI have entered in all my APIs and CSVs. During the time of this transaction, the ETH amount was worth around $3k. I do not have any other transactions around (after) these txid that could be tokens swapped. I either have 15 ETH somewhere or I have some kind of tokens that I swapped for. Can someone please help me out here? How do I figure out who the Ethereum address belongs to that the 15 ETH was sent?
