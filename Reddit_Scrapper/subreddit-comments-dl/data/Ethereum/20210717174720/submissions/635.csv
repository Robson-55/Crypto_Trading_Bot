n8moxm,1620591887,"How is the ""validator"" System not more centralizing?.....32 ETH is too high of a minimum.","I understand the need for liquidity incase of slashes to protect people who stake with you. However I feel each validator should be able to set their own risk tolerance and thus how much can be staked with them. As it stands needing a full 32 ETH to run a validator seems like a step towards centralization.   \n\n\n  \nI sure as hell don't have 32 ETH to stake but I do have the knowledge and hardware to run a validator!  At that i love the idea of taking GPUs out of the mix (for now, if we ever want to do augmented reality applications on the ETH block-chain we will need them)   \n\n\nI can't fully get with it if the alternative is a more CENTRALIZED system.  Makes me sad to see that none of you see this. I would be screaming about the minimum 32 ETH at this point its disgusting.  I'm sure the banks and all the KYC shills love this however.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n8moxm/how_is_the_validator_system_not_more/,1,27
