nh3wms,1621526243,The Future of Crypto or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying About What Coin is 'Best',"source: blockcahinexplained.org\n\nThe year is 2025 and the US economy has begun to boom after a history-book recession. Stocks are full-steam ahead and BTC is on it's way to the moon. (see FAQ ""What is a Halving"")  \n\n\nAmazon has launched their flagship token, SmileCoin. SmileCoin is a stable coin (always worth $1) and can be used as cash for any purchase (including Amazon Web Services). Using the Decentralized Finance model, by keeping your SmileCoin in your Amazon ""wallet,"" Amazon pays you back 7% APY (in SmileCoins), better than any traditional banking account can compete with.  \n\n\nBecause Amazon is no longer paying credit card transaction fees, Visa, MasterCard, and AMEX have all burrowed their way into ""HODL"" positions for SmileCoin.  \n\n\nWhat if Amazon doesn‚Äôt deliver the fresh produce you like? For a $5 transaction fee you can use ""TokenSwap"" to convert 100 SmileCoins to 7800 GroceryBucks or .0004 GoldCoins.  \n\n\nDon‚Äôt want to wait in line? Everything from supply chain to payments are on the public blockchain. Walk into the store, open the ""wallet"" on your phone, take a picture of the UPC (to add to cart), and then scan a check-out QR code at the security desk (to make sure you're only taking out what you've scanned, of course).  \n\n\nBut alas, the tax man cometh and how are 'they' dealt in? Do individual governments deserve a stake in our globally-decentralized ""coins""? They can buy coins (from us!), they can run mining nodes and store all of our data, but they can never manipulate the supply again.  \n\n\nSo we are presented with the great mystery of crypto - What happens to our financial institution when the blockchain reigns supreme?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nh3wms/the_future_of_crypto_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/,2,17

nh5i91,1621530028,Can high ETH fees be used to front run trades?,"ETH has been extremely volatile this past week. Paying high gas fees enables people to send their transactions to the front of the blockchain. It leads me to wonder: can hedge funds/exchanges manipulate the market by paying high gas fees to front run retail investors?  \n\nFor example, if a hedge fund pays $100,000 USD in ETH gas per trade, their trades would be the first ones executed. They could spike or drop a crypto in milliseconds. Then, by using highly leverage derivative contracts, they could reap massive profits. \n\nDoes anyone here have enough expertise in blockchain/ETH/crypto to determine if this is possible? Or does blockchain make front running impossible? \n\nThank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nh5i91/can_high_eth_fees_be_used_to_front_run_trades/,1,10

I made that experience when trying to use some of the apps that run on ethereum's blockchain.\n\nPoS is going to solve this problem, but there's something I don't really understand about it. \n\nThe more ETH you have, the more ETH you will get from staking, and as far as I understood you need at least 32 ETH to do so. This is an amount most people will never be able to afford. To me, this seems that ETH 2.0 is only favouring the rich. \nI got into crypto to break out from this wheel, to be able to convert my cash into an asset that is favouring those people who hold it, like for example the halving in Bitcoin does. \n\nWhat is Ethereum trying to be, and how is it different than the fundamentals of the dollar?
