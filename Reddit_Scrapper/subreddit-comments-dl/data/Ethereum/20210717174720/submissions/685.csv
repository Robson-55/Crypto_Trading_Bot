nf1hhj,1621313316,Noob Question: Is Ethereum and other coins impossible to counterfeit?,"The thought came to my mind thinking about the inherent benefits of crypto over cash but I'm just learning about this stuff. I ask about Ethereum in particular because I feel that there's a lot more development projects behind it, but I don't know if this is actually true because of the nature of crypto itself.   \n\n\nIs it impossible to counterfeit crypto? If it's not, is Ethereum better at protecting itself over these kinds of events? Are all cryptocurrencies impossible to counterfeit or one of them have an advantage over the others? Is this discussed as a benefit over fiat money?  \n\n\nSorry about my ignorance and I'd love to hear what you guys know/think about this, I think a lot of people only concentrate on the trading aspects which is cool, but I'd really like to learn more about the fundaments around cryptocurrency, especially Ethereum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nf1hhj/noob_question_is_ethereum_and_other_coins/,1,6
nf1im4,1621313422,MEW &amp; Etherscan Question,Is there a way of seeing each tokens individual balance in $ on MEW? Currently when I click to view Ether Scan I get confused as I don’t know what the Token value represents. Image [attached](https://ibb.co/rd4m1R1) I wish this was my value but this is for 1500 in Credits so unfort it’s not. I don’t get why it says also it’s worth nothing in Eth. What does this Token value represent and does anyone know how I find out each Tokens value? Thanks,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nf1im4/mew_etherscan_question/,1,1

nf2ulo,1621317914,The Future of Trading has arrived," \n\nAfter the successful launch of SafeGalaxy, we knew we had to do more. Something Bigger. Much Bigger. So on May 17, 2021, we will be launching our very own DEX, GalaxySwap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojhin99uktz61.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd934ad74b9a5b6521c8c8a1a3d640cf73782293\n\nTo kick off the launch of GalaxySwap, we are going to be doing a Giveaway of 10 Million Galaxia, per day, for 15 days. That’s a total of 150 Million Galaxia. To redeem your free Galaxia, you will need to connect your Wallet to GalaxySwap, and then login to GalaxySwap every day for 15 days to hit the Redeem button and claim your Galaxia. And yes, Redeeming your Galaxia will be as simple as pressing the “redeem” button. Here are the minimum requirements for the giveaway.\n\nYou must hold $300+ worth of SafeGalaxy in your wallet. That’s it.\n\nAnybody who holds More than $300 worth of SafeGalaxy in their wallet can participate. Because the price of SafeGalaxy fluctuates, on any given day, more or less people will be eligible for the giveaway. This means you will receive different rewards every single day, based on the number of people in the giveaway.\n\nThe amount you receive will be based on a logarithmic function, with the largest amount given to the largest wallet, and the lowest amount given to those holding $300. This is to ensure that while the largest holders do indeed earn more free Galaxia, it will not be an absurd amount compared to smaller wallets. This is the most fair way to support everyone who has supported us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xk5s5w0ltz61.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db46629b2e505c0200506b96592645717321a573\n\nHow are we going to fund GalaxySwap? We are going to be pulling from the SafeGalaxy/BNB Pool on Pancacke swap to Fund GalaxySwap. The BNB will be used to fund the initial liquidity for GalaxySwap, and the Safe Galaxy… To get out of the atmosphere, we need to kick in the Afterburners. We need to burn.\n\nTo get us going, we are going to be burning a total of 22 TRILLION SafeGalaxy over the next 17 days. This is roughly $1,000,000 worth of SafeGalaxy.\n\n3.5 Trillion tokens were Burnt May 15, 2021.\n\n3.5 Trillion tokens were Burnt May 16, 2021.\n\n1 Trillion SafeGalaxy will then be burnt every single day, for 15 days during the giveaways.\n\nEveryone gets Galaxia = Everyone Makes Money = Everybody Wins.\n\nOnce Galaxy Swap Launches, The entire game changes.\n\nTo Start, You will have the capability to Farm the Following Pairs:\n\n* SafeGalaxy/Galaxia\n* Galaxia/BNB\n* Galaxia/BUSD\n* BNB/BUSD\n\nAnd you will be able to join the following Pools:\n\n* SafeGalaxy -&gt; Get Galaxia\n* Galaxia -&gt; Get Galaxia\n\nThis will allow anyone who is currently holding SafeGalaxy, to earn Galaxia just by staking their SafeGalaxy. It’s the best of both worlds.  \nThe price of Galaxia is aimed to start around $0.10, and we couldn’t be more excited about the potential. Especially if you look at the current price of Cake, we just can’t help but smile. Our last token, SafeGalaxy, went up 300%+ after launch, and we have a very good feeling about Galaxia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjo2uno1ltz61.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=455b96d919e5ced1f2f405cdce2d80ec10c70cdd\n\nWe’re launching on May 17th, and this is just the beginning. The future of GalaxySwap, Galaxia, SafeGalaxy,and the entire GalaxyProtocol will be an exciting one, and we can’t wait to see what lies ahead. We’ve made it to Infinity, It’s time to see what’s beyond.\n\nWebsite: [https:// safegalaxy .net/](https://safegalaxy.net/)\n\nTeam: [https:// safegalaxy .net /team](https://safegalaxy.net/team)\n\nDiscord: [https:// discord .com /invite/dq7m6R7UAz](https://discord.com/invite/dq7m6R7UAz)\n\nTwitter: [https:// twitter .com /SafeGalaxyToken](https://twitter.com/SafeGalaxyToken)\n\nTwitter: [https:// twitter .com /GalaxySwapX](https://twitter.com/GalaxySwapX)\n\nTelegram: [https:// t . me /safegalaxychat](https://t.me/safegalaxychat)\n\nChart: [https:// dex . guru /token /0x6b51231c43b1604815313801db5e9e614914d6e4-bsc](https://dex.guru/token/0x6b51231c43b1604815313801db5e9e614914d6e4-bsc)\n\nVerified contract: [https:// bscscan . com /token /0x6b51231c43b1604815313801db5e9e614914d6e4](https://bscscan.com/token/0x6b51231c43b1604815313801db5e9e614914d6e4)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nf2ulo/the_future_of_trading_has_arrived/,1,3

nf4fcd,1621323613,"ELI5: Decentralized exchanges and ""presales""","I've recently started using Uniswap. It's great, apart from all the scams. Short of just rugging, there seem to be a lot of new projects that have their liquidity provided through a ""presale"", which seems to be just the owner allocating tokens to his own wallets. Besides from that, the majority of these projects offer fake promises (Coingecko listing soon! etc), and encourage other people to shill for them. What I'm wondering is how is this so commonplace? Is crypto really that much of a greyzone where creating your own project and then dumping on the people who buy isn't actually illegal? Is this just the same group of people making new projects over and over again? Both? I'm just having a hard time wrapping my head around this. \n\nIf anyone more educated on this topic could perhaps explain this to me that would be much appreciated. Google seems to bring up ambiguous results.\n\nMy apologies if this question does not belong here. I figured since Uniswap is an exchange for ERC20 tokens this might be an ok place to ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nf4fcd/eli5_decentralized_exchanges_and_presales/,1,4
