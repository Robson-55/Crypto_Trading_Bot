mur31c,1618927560,How does daostack work?,"Hi all,\n\nI have been interested in created a shared fund in a smart contract and came across alchemy daostack and this WP plugin. At the moment i would like to start with daostack but I do not know how much coding knowledge I require.\n\nWhat I would like to do is allow members to deposit funds into the dao, trade those fund between currencies and return those funds back to the members. The funds belonging to the individual members would have to be recorded in the dao so that when they want to withdraw, they don't withdraw more than what they own.\n\nsome questions i have are, can the exchange of currencies within the dao expense gas stored in the dao? what about chi tokens? Also, is there a list of available plugins to implement? somewhere i can search and review my options?\n\nany help is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mur31c/how_does_daostack_work/,1,0

ETH isn't going to be burning more carbon that all of Argentina.    \n\n\nWhat does all of this mean?  It means that people who care about the planet will be moving their value from Bitcoin to ETH.  $1 trillion+ will soon migrate over to ETH which is ecologically much better than Bitcoin.   \n\n\nThis will be a primary price driver in the next 12 months.
