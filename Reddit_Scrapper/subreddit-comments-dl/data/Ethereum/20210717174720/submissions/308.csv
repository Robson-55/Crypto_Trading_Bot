ky23sz,1610739713,Got hacked and lost 250K worth of ETH possibly due to Ledger data leak,"Here is the transactation where all my funds are transfered out to the hacker:\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb5c558132f067898d5cd2a8e0c78d03a7a928a2193d11e2b1759855e2171ec53](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb5c558132f067898d5cd2a8e0c78d03a7a928a2193d11e2b1759855e2171ec53)\n\nmy address: 0x9aa9d489f8df3f90a65fe57be6926e3a3ec4c62d\n\nhacker address: 0x8fda285fddd580fd0551a4dfba9fc7d366edc580\n\nI bought a ledger nano s back in 2016 and store all my eth inside it. Today,  I was checking my account and suprisingly found out all my coins were gone, worth 250k CAD.\n\nI couldn't figure out how the hacker got my private key because I never revealed it to anybody and only stored a backup (encrypted with my own password) in google drive. I checked my google account activity and haven't found any thing suspicious.\n\nThis must be a highly targeted attack torward me and the hacker found out some vulnerability either in my computer or my phone which I used for sending out transactions.\n\nIt's devasting to me cause this is all I saved since 2016,  I lost my job last year and i've been cahsing out my eth out bit by bit for living expenses, and now i have none.  I will continue buying eth in the future, but I'm really not sure if I would ever trust any hardware or software wallets, even a centralized exchange such as gemini seems to be a better choice for security reasons.

kybfgj,1610769443,I believe the future of gaming is in NFTs but I need help getting it started,"I think one day all video game assets will be collectable and exchangeable NFTs, so to try and start that future I created CryptoWeapons https://app.rarible.com/cryptoweapons/collectibles which is a collection of 50 3D guns and weapon NFTs that all come with their 3D file once purchased to be used for anything!\n\nEvery weapon is unique and I made all of them from scratch. The only problem is, because of high gas fees I only have enough budget to mint 5 so far.\n\nI feel so pathetic asking, but if someone bought just one of the weapons for 1 ETH that would be almost exactly enough to fund the minting of the other 45!\n\nI really believe in this exciting future, and thats why with the purchase of a CryptoWeapon the buyer would have access to the exact 3D file of the gun to customize, use for game dev, for animations, or even for someone to make their own NFTs with!\n\nI need to fund around $1,100 to $1,500 in order to mint them before gas fees get any higher.
