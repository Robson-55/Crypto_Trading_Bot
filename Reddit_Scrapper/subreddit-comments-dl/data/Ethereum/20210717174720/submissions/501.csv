mklszf,1617632447,Interesting ERC-20 project in 2021 - A review,"I stumbled across the project StudentCoin. Seems to be the biggest ICO 2021. It reminds me of 2017.\n\n\nThe project is unique in the crypto space and if it starts to get more attention it can become a very popular coin.\n\nAnybody can create their own token on top of StudentCoin via a web interface. No programming skills required.\nIf you stake StudentCoin (STC) you earn from all transactions of the tokens on top of STC. Students are the future and bring innovation and proper use cases.\n\n\nIn two weeks they just launched their wallet, mobile app and announced 3 exchange listings.\n\n\nThe team confirmed that STC is going to be listed on 9 new exchanges from the top 50 (a few from them are top 20 and top 10) from May 2021.\n\n\nTheir presale is currently live and 109 of 150 phases are finished.\n\n\nA review is nothing without negative points and criticisms:\n\nÂ  - Communication of the team could be improved\n\nÂ  - There is a lot of FUD.. The team could just clear this up better and comment on all the criticisms. To improve that they are planning to make a team interview series from next week to be closer to the community.\n\nÂ  - The 500 universities are not all real partners.. they just have students from those universities as supporter.. its not clear which universities are partners\n\n\nThe ico price is still really low with 0.018 USD.\n\n\nA small portion of the circulating supply is beeing traded on Uniswap for 0.026 USD already.\n\n\nStudentCoin is already on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/\n\n\nStudentCoin Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/studentcoinorg\n\n\nThere are three options to participate:\n\nÂ  - buy STC via Credit Card\n\nÂ  - send ETH from your MetaMask wallet\n\nÂ  - send any crypto to the Coinbase Commerce payment method\n\n\nI just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay the package.\n\n\nI recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.\n\n\nCoinbase Commerce works also for US investors.\n\n\nUse this bonus code to get 5% more at the purchase.\n\n\nCODE: Sxlb8setj7\n\n\nOr the link: https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sxlb8setj7\n\n\nI would appreciate if you support me :)\n\n\n* this is not a financial advice.

mko8x0,1617638987,My second smart contract! here are my notes...,"# Introduction\n\nIn my last post ([LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mhksff/my_first_smart_contract_what_did_i_learn/)) I shared my personal notes about the first experience of programming a smart contract using solidity. Now in this opportunity I'll share the solutions of my ""future tasks"" that I mentioned there:\n\n* How can the parent add more kids to the smart contract? (This question made me laugh after seeing the first comment of that post)\n* How can the parent add more balance to the kids\n\n# Smart Contract \n\nThe idea behind this smart contract consist in having a parent that wants his multiple kids to withdraw the money deposited after certain date. You can check the code here: [LINK](https://pastebin.com/Ar0AdNSi)\n\n# Notes:\n\n* We can use mapping(\_key\_type\_=&gt;\_value\_type\_) to link data between different object types. In this case there is a link between a kid address and the amount available to withdraw\n* Currently there's not option to check is a key is already in the map but this can be achieve by checking the supposed value \n* In my journey of this development I came across with the ""Smart Contract Security"". I recommend to take a look at this before deploying any smart contract into the real world (I didn't know that smart contracts can be attacked)\n* Remember to update internal data before making any external calls. This avoids reentrancy attack \n\n# Doubts:\n\n* Why paybale(\_address\_).transfer(\_amount\_) does not call the fallback function and msg.sender.call.value(\_amount\_) does?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mko8x0/my_second_smart_contract_here_are_my_notes/,1,5

mkp2gn,1617641190,"If ETH switches to PoS , IM OUT!","&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n## The Worst Kind of Centralization\n\nUnder this algorithm, changes to protocol code is not determined by miner consensus, but by a vote from staking wallets. Additionally, the protocol weighs votes based on the holdings of staking wallets. So whoever has the most money has the most influence over a vote.\n\nThis means that a small group of wealthy stakers can control the entire network, voting on changes that benefit them â€” even at the cost of the rest of the network. Under such a system, a large entity or wealthy group, such as a central bank, can use fiat money to purchase vast quantities of a PoS coin, hold them until their wallets become eligible for staking, and then take over the network.\n\nOnce the network has been infiltrated and seized by these interests, they can do things that make the PoS system less efficient and more dangerous than it already is. For example, controlling interests in a PoS network could vote to remove the supply cap. And since they have the highest holdings of staking coins, they get the highest cut of the new coins â€” giving them majority control over the monetary supply.\n\nSuch a vote would essentially create a central bank, allowing controlling stakers to use and distribute newly-minted coins as they please. In other words, they can conduct central banking monetary policy.\n\nConsequently, economic cycles, politics, and corruption will enter the equation, throwing the PoS-based economy into chaos.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mkp2gn/if_eth_switches_to_pos_im_out/,1,48
