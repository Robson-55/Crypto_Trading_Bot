nu9stp,1623064310,"After bitcoin falls, what will happen to other cryptocurrencies?","Hello everybody! I think everyone had already heard about bitcoin’s dramatic fall last week? I believe that news was all over the media, saying that bitcoin almost reached its lowest point. So I’m pretty sure that you are all aware of this piece of information. But will this dramatic fall of bitcoin somehow affect the value of other cryptocurrencies? What do you think about that? I want to hear an expert’s opinion, and maybe someone here can explain to a beginner how it works for the rest of the currencies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to let you know in advance that I’m not an experienced trader on crypto markets. I’m just thinking of joining this field. Therefore, I won’t gather as much as possible valuable information and maybe some tips before I start trading and invest my own savings into any cryptocurrency. Many of my friends are trading in this field, and some are even able to make some good money. Besides, they even quit their main jobs to dedicate more time to trading. While others are not really lucky, they have lost a fortune because of the recent market crash. Some of my friends even shared this meme with me to stop me from trading. I’m sharing it with you guys. Maybe you are on their side too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u30yrspqtt371.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90aacffef2883e0c35d631c66695c771b628c178\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as I know, insider information plays a significant role in any financial market. However, it is also recommended to use a few sources to verify each piece of information you get. Besides, I found out that some info can be obtained even through different messengers, such as telegram. I found this info on this site and I wonder what do you think about that? Has some insider information or trusted sources saved you from this new crypto-financial crisis?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far, I’ve seen that some people succeed in mining and investing in cryptocurrencies, while others fail in this. I believe that more knowledge in this field and maybe some experience will help me avoid making some mistakes that might cost me a fortune!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nu9stp/after_bitcoin_falls_what_will_happen_to_other/,1,5
