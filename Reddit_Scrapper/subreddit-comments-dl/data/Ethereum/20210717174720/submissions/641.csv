n99j73,1620664612,Email received from Bitcoin Suisse: ETH2 Staking offering,"Dear all, \n\nI have gotten the following email from Bitcoin Suisse (amounts have been replaced with X and Y): \n\n&gt;I hope you are doing well during these special times.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The reason for contacting you is related to your ETH2 staking position.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For  more efficient operational processing on our side, it would help us if  you staked your ETH2 in ""stacks"" of 32 ETH. Since you are currently  staking a total  of **X** **ETH** and the next 32 ETH increment would be **32 ETH**, this would mean that you would have to move **at least** another **Y ETH** into the staking. In return, we would therefore reduce our staking fee on your total ETH2 holdings from **15%** to **10%** for 1 year. Once the additional ETH have been deposited, you can contact me so I can initiate the transfer to the staking account for you.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Is  this offer of interest to you? If so, you are welcome to instruct us  directly once your holdings are sufficient to make up the difference in  the ETH2 Staking  account or you can think about it and call or contact us back within  the  **24 hours**.\n\nI am a bit surprised and uneasy with the rush. Why contact back within 24 hours ? Why do they need to stack by 32 eth and not before ? \n\nWhat do you think ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n99j73/email_received_from_bitcoin_suisse_eth2_staking/,1,5

n9ablq,1620666511,How long will cross shard transactions take?,"VB:\n\n&gt;given a base layer blockchain that offers slow asynchronous cross-shard transactions, we can emulate fast asynchronous cross-shard transactions as a layer on top.\n\n&gt;This is done by storing ‚Äúconditional states‚Äù, for example if Bob has 50 coins on shard B, and Alice sends 20 coins to Bob from shard A, but shard B does not yet know the state of shard A and so cannot fully authenticate the transfer, Bob‚Äôs account state temporarily becomes ‚Äú70 coins if the transfer from Alice is genuine, else 50 coins‚Äù. Clients that have the ability to authenticate shard A and shard B can be sure of the ‚Äúfinality‚Äù of the transfer (ie. the fact that Bob‚Äôs account state will eventually resolve to 70 coins once the transfer can be verified inside the chain) almost immediately, and so their wallets can simply act like Bob already has the 70 coins.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, Bob has the ability to send the received coins to Charlie almost immediately, though Charlie‚Äôs wallet would also need to be able to authenticate shard A to verify the payment.\n\nFrom above, it seems a third party just needs to check the individual shard states instead of waiting for the beacon chain updates to use funds from cross shard transactions almost immediately.
