kmkxtd,1609269830,Is this a bubble?,"I know the basics of crypto but Iâ€™m not the most knowledgeable with it and with investing terms. Speaking directly with interest in ETH (thatâ€™s what I invested in) Do you believe this is a bubble that will shortly go back down after itâ€™s peak or do you expect a steady increase-that this is the new bottom? Also, with so many options now with altcoins, what are your top 5 for hodl (yes Iâ€™m doing my research but they all seem to have potential  but tezos is catching my eye). Iâ€™m a semi-newbie so cut me some slack in the responses please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kmkxtd/is_this_a_bubble/,1,10

kmn3r5,1609276397,More secretEther users needed! Privacy fans unite.,"So The Secret Network Ethereum bridge is live. \n\nFirst off I am not affiliated with The Secret Network. I'm an advocate for privacy and have used [tornado.cash](https://tornado.cash) since inception. This is another option for Ether privacy, cheaper but more complicated that tornado.\n\nThere is currently 148 ETH locked which means that right now it is not that secret, we need a larger pool for more privacy. Whole Ether amounts increase the anonymity set as well  (0.1,1,2,3,etc.). It's great to see different projects improving privacy on Ethereum (even if it is cross chain!)\n\nRead more here: [https://scrt.network/blog/secret-ethereum-bridge-is-live-on-mainnet](https://scrt.network/blog/secret-ethereum-bridge-is-live-on-mainnet)\n\nUse it here: [https://bridge.scrt.network/](https://bridge.scrt.network/)\n\nWould like to see more use and interest in the project, hopefully others can try it as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kmn3r5/more_secretether_users_needed_privacy_fans_unite/,1,5

I don't have 32 ETH (Not in the slightest) but I use Kraken and kraken supports staking ETH with &lt; 32 ETH. Kraken even lets me unstake my ETH (sort of) by creating a trading pair for Staked ETH and unstaked ETH. This seems really interesting and it would reward me with a couple bucks each month. Now here come the big questions:\n\n* Is there any risk in losing my ETH (partially or entirely) by staking it on Kraken?\n\nThe next question is Kraken related but here it goes:\n\n* Am I able to transfer the rewards earned by staking ETH to regular ETH using the trading pair?\n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kmo2ph/should_i_stake/,1,9

What I donâ€™t know: is there any sort of realistic way to arrive at a best case scenario price valuation for ETH? For example, if BTC can gain equal footing with gold from a market cap perspective, we could roughly expect a $500k BTC. Sure there is plenty of variance up or down based on a variety pack of factors, but I can get a ROUGH idea of what it could be worth. Is there anything we can look at to estimate the best case price scenario for ETH?
