lw4ok1,1614699239,What's happened to paper wallet creation?,"I'm cold storing some Bitcoin and Ethereum. I've had a look at hardware wallets but they seem like a real faff to deal with. So I've created Bitcoin paper wallet (offline using a clean linux machine) - easy peasy, no hardware to go wrong that requires separate piece of paper anyway with recovery code. \n\nBut when it comes to creating Ethereum wallet I can find articles describing how to make a paper one - but the MEW site has changed now and it doesn't seem to work. I think I have to create a wallet using keystone file (online?) and then when I access it on the MEW website (inputting the password, which I don't know what that is for) I can see the wallet and print a copy of the public and private keys. But by that point it's been loaded onto a website on a computer connected to internet - not secure? \n\nIs there not a way to create a wallet offline and then send some Eth to it afterwards?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lw4ok1/whats_happened_to_paper_wallet_creation/,1,9

Under Flight sheet i created one which is using Phoenix miner and entered my blockchain ETH wallet there.\n\n2. Under wallets i created an ETH wallet and also entered my blockchain ETH wallet.\n\n3. Im running my rig (2x 3090) since 2 hours now and nothing happened yet. \n\n4. Will all this work and will i recieve ethereum on my blockchain Account ? \nWill it Not Work and land on my HiveOS Account ? \nOr will it Not Work and go no where ?\n\nAlso what is Farm Hash ID ?
