l9bt37,1612097868,Accepting Ethereum payments on my website?,"I'm new to ethereum, an I really like the idea of being able to accept payments on a website for ecommerce without a merchant account or paypal.\n\nBut when I look into accepting payments via ethereum, I have to sign up for some corporate website like bitpay or coinbase for merchants and once again I'm at the mercy of a third party.\n\n So... how can I accept payments via qr codes on my website, plug into some kind of api for backend things..... also pay affiliates immediately in eth, yet still have full control over a node/wallet that isn't controlled by a third party?\n\nSorry,  kind of a newbie, but isn't this like the main application of crypto and why isn't it easier to setup?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l9bt37/accepting_ethereum_payments_on_my_website/,53,47
