o4bzeg,1624214217,A simple contract for keeping track of collaterals?,"For a separate project that I am working on, I needed a contract that keeps track of how much ERC20/ETH is set aside by an address for another address. I wrote the following contract (github link attached), that allows a user to deposit a certain amount of ERC20/ETH into a 'collateral' position, which they can trade around to other users as if it were an NFT. They can also specify the conditions that need to be met before the position can be liquidated back into ERC20/ETH\n\nThis seemed like something general enough so I was wondering if I might be re-inventing the wheel. Is there an EIP standard for similar purposes?\n\n[https://github.com/jinhongkuan/collaterize/blob/main/contracts/Collaterize.sol](https://github.com/jinhongkuan/collaterize/blob/main/contracts/Collaterize.sol)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4bzeg/a_simple_contract_for_keeping_track_of_collaterals/,2,2
