ktcqqo,1610142806,Politics,"TLDR: I don‚Äôt think people will be able to make sense of up from down when crypto grows, because our conceptualization of almost everything is predicated on our deeply ingrained sense of the master science (political science) being stable and fundamental.\n\n\n\nI want to preface this with an apology if this comes across as too grandiose. I in no way want to pretend like crypto is Jesus Christ, or pretend that it is going to change the world tomorrow. I just want to share some thoughts that I think are currently uncommon in the popular discussion around crypto. I think these ideas present a bullish picture for crypto but also a scary one for our society at large. \n\nAristotle called politics the master science. Politics can be seen as the axioms which determine all other progress. I think why crypto is so confusing to people is that we‚Äôre used to disruption happening to the variables, and not to the axioms. One company can conceptualize a category differently and erode the power of another company, (think how Facebook defeats the traditional media, or how Apple defeats Nikon). The classic SV book the ‚ÄúInnovator‚Äôs Dilemma‚Äù covers this idea. Crypto on the other hand is a disrupter of the master science. On the most abstract level possible, crypto enables humans to coordinate on mass scale without an intermediary. You can think of maybe 1 or 2 times in human history where the potential of the master science has been this dramatically altered. Democracy, Nationalism, fascism, feudalism, agrarianism, and even tribalism have seemed diverse, but have all been similar systems that have all relied on leaders and institutions to address the coordination problem. The nation-state as a institution is a lot weaker than it appears. It is a myth just as ‚Äúreal‚Äù as any religion. It doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúexist‚Äù per se. States are also not fundamentally different from corporations. They are institutions comprised of people and have revenues and expenses. They just seem much more stable than corporations because the master science is rarely disrupted. \n\nI worry about this because I don‚Äôt think the transition will be easy as we discover this more efficient system and collectively wake up from the ‚Äúmyth‚Äù of the nation-state. A couple good books are the ‚ÄúSovereign Individual‚Äù and ‚ÄúExit, Voice and Loyalty‚Äù, which provide a toolkit for thinking about a post-nation state world. The Sovereign Individual also outlines a theory that crypto alters the ‚Äúreturns on violence‚Äù, meaning that the power of the state‚Äôs monopoly on violence lessens. \n\nI think that many of us who live in rich countries have had it easy because the current nation-state system has locked in a lot of wealth to certain geographies. In this potential reshuffling of the world, the probability that certain physical jurisdictions will still have these advantages feels slim. Additionally, a crypto world is a hyper-meritocracy, where nation states that are weakened by these new systems have to start competing for wealthy citizens. The combination of crypto and remote work is powerful. I don‚Äôt think people will be able to make sense of up from down when crypto grows, because our conceptualization of almost everything is predicated on our deeply ingrained sense of the master science being stable and fundamental. \n\nThese are just some thoughts. Please let me know if you think I‚Äôm completely wrong, or if I‚Äôm just stating the obvious! I just think people don‚Äôt realize that the nation-state system is at risk of disruption just like a company can be.
