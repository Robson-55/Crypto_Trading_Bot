mzspxs,1619541884,Thoughts on smart contract wallets?,"There are some wallets available like loopring wallet and argent wallets that provide additional conveniences to traditional wallets. Whitelisting accounts, daily spending limits, an ENS, and social wallet recovery (If you lose your phone, your guardian contacts can agree and restore it for you).\n\nIt does come at a cost though. It cost me over $100 to create the wallet because it's a smart contract, and setting a daily limit makes all transactions more expensive because the limit needs to be checked every time you send crypto. I do like the fact that I don't have to manage a seed phrase or be worried about someone hacking into my wallet and draining it. I would think these types of wallets will become more popular once the transaction fees are low enough it makes sense for the average user.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mzspxs/thoughts_on_smart_contract_wallets/,1,0
