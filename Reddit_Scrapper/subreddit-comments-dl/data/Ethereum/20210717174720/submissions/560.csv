mydtrm,1619373998,Morphic Studio - The First Decentralized Art Organization?,"Found a cool project in the works. Here's their description:\n\nIt‚Äôs a white canvas for anyone to draw on, with participants driven &amp; incentivised to collaborate by the tokenomics of **The Canvas**. I see at as a version of Reddit place with a crypto-native design. In their own words, it's:\n\nThe purpose of The Canvas is to show that with the right incentives, communities are able to create high-quality art which others will be able to build on top of. Their long-term aim is to build solutions that\n\n* Enable large communities to trustlessly collaborate and share earnings on collaborative artwork\n* Earns artists a stable income, not having to live from project-to-project\n* Develop heuristics to determine the minimum value of an artwork\n\nSome of the general use cases they are exploring:\n\n* Working together on an art piece, without having to know or trust your collaborators to sell the work and share the profits\n* Evidence ‚Äúcost of creation‚Äù for NFTs. There‚Äôs a lot of discussion around the ‚Äútrue value‚Äù of NFTs today, and whilst this will probably always remain a point of discussion (similar with bitcoin), blockchains should help to establish a proof of work to arrive at a minimum price.\n* Seed investing in artists. Supporting artists even before the artworks are released, providing a more stable income to typically unstable profession\n\nMore info on the canvas: [https://www.morphic.studio/post/introducing-the-canvas](https://www.morphic.studio/post/introducing-the-canvas)\n\nWebsite: [https://morphic.studio/](https://morphic.studio/)\n\nMedium: [https://morphic-studio.medium.com/](https://morphic-studio.medium.com/)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/morphicstudio](https://t.me/morphicstudio)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/M9feHMe5](https://discord.gg/M9feHMe5)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mydtrm/morphic_studio_the_first_decentralized_art/,1,31
