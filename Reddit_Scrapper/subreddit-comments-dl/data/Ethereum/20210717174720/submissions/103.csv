i6jyky,1596982280,I don't feel like people quite appreciate what a huge deal the eWASM implementation for ETH2 is going to be,"One argument I regularly see from other smart contract platforms is that they're going to support multiple languages or a more popular programming language for their smart contracts.\n\nNot that developers can't pick up Solidity, once you know one language the core programming concepts carry over, but it's definitely a significant barrier to entry, especially when it's literally the only use case for that language.\n\neWASM is a great solution, create a virtual machine with the same ""architecture"" that can run platform-independent byte-code compiled from any language, and better yet, just piggy-back off all the work developers are already doing to get the Web independent of JavaScript.\n\nIt's a great move and eliminates what is in my opinion one of the remaining roadblocks for Ethereum development to skyrocket.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/i6jyky/i_dont_feel_like_people_quite_appreciate_what_a/,1,48
