o4ywjl,1624292345,üöÄWelcome to the newest Token based on the Ethereum Network!," \n\nEthereum Chain Token was created to be the fair crypto, a system where just being a holder gets you rewarded. We wanted to create a token as a real store of value that gave back to the community. A truly transparent every day crypto currency that benefited all that held. We have a clear roadmap in place and have locked 30% of our liquidity with another 20% being burnt. The dev wallet holds 25% locked for 1 year and the remaining 25% is being used for marketing. The team has been working day and night to bring you something special that will stand the test of time. We have raised $500k in funding to get to this stage, and will be implementing a social media campaign endorsed by high profile celebrities. We know we are a small cog in a big wheel but we are a necessary cog, to show that it can be done right. Ethereum Chain Token is the future.\n\nüì∑Hold &amp; Earnüì∑ Every transaction incurs a 10% fee with 5% distributed to holders ‚Äì $ECT will automatically be allocated to your wallet, so there‚Äôs nothing you have to do but simply HOLD and be REWARDED.The other 5% is permanently added to liquidity.\n\nüì∑Sale starts July 20, 2021\n\nüì∑Clear Roadmap\n\nüì∑Community Driven Project\n\nüì∑Marketing Team Onboard\n\nüì∑Liquidity Locked for 1 year\n\nüì∑$500k in funding raised\n\nüì∑ üì∑ üì∑ üì∑ üì∑ üì∑ For more information please check our website\n\nüì∑[https://t.me/joinchat/534sn8XdlupmMDY0](https://t.me/joinchat/534sn8XdlupmMDY0)\n\nüì∑[https://www.instagram.com/ethereumchaintoken/](https://www.instagram.com/ethereumchaintoken/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4ywjl/welcome_to_the_newest_token_based_on_the_ethereum/,0,4
