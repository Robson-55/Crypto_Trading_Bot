lccdra,1612432277,Transaction nonce,"So i am making rookie mistake, i know but\nI have a guarda wallet, sending eth i can choose gwei price that i want, so i made a transaction with only 1 gwei  but of course never appeared on the mempool or was quicly ""canceled"" then i saw on etherchain that the safelow was 10, so i tried again with a gwei of 11, but the nonce is apparently 0x3 intead of 0x2 or 0x1,  and the transaction is stuck since 7 hour instead of 30mins to 2 hours to get confirmed. Then i send another transaction with gwei 90 to try and get it mined first setting 0x1 on the guarda wallet and get this over with. But the nonce appear to be 0x3 once again and i'm afraid that some ghost transactions are queing up somewhere else... On etherscan i can only see 2 transactions pending with a duplicate nonce of 0x3, where are 0x2 and 0x1? Why i don't get to overwrite that? Since 0x2 and 0x1 are not in the mempool apparently, will i ever be able to get this mined or what? What i have to do? I am desperate",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lccdra/transaction_nonce/,2,0
