mstsx2,1618676637,How does EIP-1559 adjust basefee if ETH price goes up or down?,"My understanding of EIP-1559 is that if a block is 50% full then the basefee doesn't change. If it's above or below the 50% then it goes up or down as well. But what if blocks remain 50% full and ETH price keeps going up? If the basefee remains the same, the USD value of that basefee will go up.\n\nMy initial thought was that, if ETH price went up, then less people will want to pay for the now higher basefee with respect to USD so blocks will end up less than 50% full and basefee falls, but the problem I can't get my head around is this means that blocks would also contain less transactions/gas which means that if we wanted to support # of transactions at 50% we would be forced to pay high basefees in terms of USD.\n\nAs an example:\n\nETH price = $2k\n\nBlock at 50% = 12.5 Million Gas\n\nBasefee = 100 gwei\n\nSimple ETH transfer = $4.20\n\n\n--- Eth goes up --\n\nETH price = $2,500\n\nBlock at 50% = 10 Million Gas\n\nBasefee = 80 Gwei\n\nSimple ETH transfer = $4.20\n\n\n-- If we wanted to support 12.5 M Gas Blocks, we are forced to pay more USD since basefee stays the same!\n\nETH price = $2,500\n\nBlock at 50% = 12.5 Million Gas\n\nBasefee = 100 Gwei\n\nSimple ETH transfer = $5.25\n\n\nUnder the current auction system, when ETH price goes up, the gas price (typically goes down) to attempt to match the same USD value:\n\nETH price = $2,500\n\nBlock full at 12.5 M Gas\n\nGas price = 80 Gwei\n\nSimple ETH transfer = $4.20\n\n\nHow does EIP-1559 keep basefee relative to USD if it's purely based on block capacity?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mstsx2/how_does_eip1559_adjust_basefee_if_eth_price_goes/,1,49
