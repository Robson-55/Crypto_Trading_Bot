lr75o3,1614153421,Solution to the Gas Dilemma - Phase 1 &amp; Sharding,"Look, I know there's a lot of FUD right now with gas fees. But I'm just going to tell you right now, I've been in this market and observed this same psychology with Bitcoin last cycle. This eventually led to the ever so dear altseasons where many coins aside from Bitcoin started to explode in value. While this euphoria lasted through the bull market, ultimately these coins bled out and lost all their value versus the dominant pairs (BTC &amp; ETH) and made lower lows in the bear market.....most today that have not fully recovered.\n\nNow today, I'm observing this same behavior with Ethereum and competing networks. These other networks (BNB so recently) have started to gain in value; however what's not being considered is  Phase 1 &amp; Sharding: [https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/)\n\nThis effectively resolves the gas issues we're seeing on the main chain today. And after Phase 1, I'm not so sure competiting networks will be a thing anymore. I suggest listening to the timestamped podcast in the link above.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lr75o3/solution_to_the_gas_dilemma_phase_1_sharding/,35,64
