On the exchange website, it said the order has been completed, and they have deducted ETH from my account. However, it's been more than 72 hours, and I've not received any ETH in my wallet. Also, there is no record showing up on Etherscan. Did I mess up the transfer? I would appreciate if you guys can offer any solutions. Thanks.\nHere is the transaction hash: 0x5c7b325b4bdb48437a547eb67c587fd658f497fb86141a90660097d732f95bd5\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x5c7b325b4bdb48437a547eb67c587fd658f497fb86141a90660097d732f95bd5",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/liqmfo/did_i_lose_my_eth/,1,28
