I¬¥m not big investor in crypto, I dont have thousands of USD to buy a lot of BTC, but I can buy some nice portion of ETH and ADA...\n\nWhat would You do?

lgsh1n,1612959582,Idea for Alternative to PoW and PoS - Training AI,"Hi there,  \n\nI've had an idea in my head and I wanted to share it to see if it had any validity or not.  \n\nCurrently proof-of-work is the most popular form of validation, but it results in a NEGATIVE impact because energy is being wasted on cracking meaningless algorithms, which is why cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum are moving to proof-of-stake. \n\nProof-of-Stake has a mostly NEUTRAL impact because energy is not being wasted, but nothing is gained from the validation process other than possibly promoting liquidity in the market. \n\nI was thinking of a POSITIVE impact that could come out of the validation process. What if instead of cracking algorithms, the proof-of-work system transitioned to minimizing loss functions in training AI, or optimized some other metric in the training process like accuracy, which would act as the validation. This would enable AI researchers and developers to train models without fronting the costs that exist today, and give them much more computing power. This would progress the AI industry forward an exceptional amount. \n\nLet me know if anything like this is remotely possible or if I fundamentally lack understanding. Feel free to take the idea further if you see any hope in it. \n\nThank you for your time",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lgsh1n/idea_for_alternative_to_pow_and_pos_training_ai/,1,5
