n6k7xi,1620341988,"PSA: Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a dead, insecure chain with no fundamental value","I'm seeing a lot of interest in Ethereum Classic lately, mostly from people relatively new to crypto. Here are some facts.\n\nIn 2016, a major smart contract on Ethereum with 14% of all extant ETH locked up in (The Dao) it suffered a hack that resulted in much of the ETH being stolen. The Ethereum community was split on what to do, and eventually there was a controversial hard fork.\n\nThe UNCHANGED chain (with the attacker keeping the stolen funds) became Ethereum Classic.\n\nThe HARD FORKED chain (with all the hacked ETH put into a different, safe smart contract for withdrawal) became today's main Ethereum chain. Ethereum has not conducted any further hard forks (that change chain state) after that point.\n\nEthereum has subsequently seen the vast majority of development and usage compared to Ethereum Classic, and all of the DeFi and other dApps we have come to know and love are built on Ethereum, **NOT** Ethereum Classic. \n\nEssentially no development has taken place on Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum Classic has a tiny fraction of the hash rate that Ethereum does, leaving it vulnerable to 51% attacks, three of which have happened so far. This is where an attacker takes over the chain and executes invalid transactions for their own financial gain. It means the blockchain is fundamentally worthless (the entire point of a blockchain is to be trustlessly secure).\n\nEthereum, by contrast, is one of the most secure chains out there, along with Bitcoin. \n\nAll of these reasons are why Ethereum currently has a much higher market cap than Ethereum Classic, and a higher price per coin. They are **NOT** ""the same chain"", or one is ""the same but cheaper"". Ethereum has fantastic fundamentals, and Ethereum Classic has none.\n\nDo with that information what you will, and good luck out there!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n6k7xi/psa_ethereum_classic_etc_is_a_dead_insecure_chain/,1,946
