n5atha,1620202390,Self Stacking ETH does it worth it?,So I am thinking about to invest in ETH on long term.

n5b12m,1620203301,Crypto Growth this month,I‚Äôm planning on commiting suicide soon but if I can manage to get enough money from crypto within the next month or two to get out of my bad situation I might change my mind. I‚Äôm looking for a good altcoin or altcoins to invest in with the largest potential returns for 1-2 months. I wouldn‚Äôt be asking on this subreddit but have had no luck on others. Bitcoin has only made me 5% gains for short term trades and that‚Äôs not enough. I have $2300 to use but I might be able to gather another $1200. Any help would be appreciated. Yes I know it‚Äôs not a smart idea but I don‚Äôt care and I‚Äôm ok with either outcome.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n5b12m/crypto_growth_this_month/,1,11
