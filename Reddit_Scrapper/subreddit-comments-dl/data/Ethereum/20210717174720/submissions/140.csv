Should the queries go through a RestAPI or should the app be calling the smart contract directly? \n\nIf it's the latter I feel that the smart contract would add alot of extra code (to sanitize queries), but if it goes through a RestAPI wouldn't that be ""depending on a 3rd party"" which is what smart contracts developed to avoid in the first place?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ioqg2c/a_question_on_dapps_and_interaction_with_smart/,1,8

However, the transaction took too long to confirm and my vault was liquidated in the meantime.\n\nSo, now I'm wondering what happened to the 500 DAI I paid back?
