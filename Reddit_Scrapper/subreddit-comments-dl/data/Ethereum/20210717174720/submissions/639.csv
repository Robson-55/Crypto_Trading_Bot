n91fqg,1620643273,Diversified Staking?,"Hi all. Just wanted to get your thoughts on staking. Right now I’m basically tossing up between Lido and Binance. One is decentralised and the other is the opposite. Binance more credible since it’s a renowned exchange where Lido isn’t as renowned. Though from my learnings, exchanges are never safe from being hacked. I don’t know how vulnerable decentralised Lido would be to hacks but my guess is there’s still a risk. \n\nSo I’m thinking to put half on each  staking options. Is this “diversification” of staking a good idea? Can I expect same rewards as I would get by pooling into just one of the options?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n91fqg/diversified_staking/,1,7

n93gba,1620650349,Minimising network/mining fees on Coinbase Pro,"Ethereum first time buyer here. Bought ethereum on Coinbase Pro, now looking to withdraw to a personal wallet for security purposes.\n\nCoinbase Pro does not let you change the network fee/mining fee when withdrawing Ethereum to a personal wallet. However, I believe that Coinbase Wallet does. Seeing as transfers between Coinbase Pro and Coinbase Wallet are free, could I withdraw the Ethereum to a Coinbase Wallet for free and then withdraw from the Coinbase Wallet to my personal wallet, setting the transfer priority as low to minimise the network fee? Seems like a easy way of circumventing the annoying feature on Coinbase Pro which doesn’t let you choose the network fee.\n\nJust need a sense check of whether this would work.
