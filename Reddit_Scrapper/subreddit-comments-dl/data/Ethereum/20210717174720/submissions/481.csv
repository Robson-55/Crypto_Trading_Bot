Learning a lot!,"I've been paying attention for lots of years to the crypto space but in the last two months I've gone down the rabbit hole in the technical aspects and I have to say that it's really mind-blowing. I truly mean it.\n\n\nOf course there are things that need to be improved, but many talented and hardworking people are developing the solutions needed for those problems. Hopefully we are able to solve them in the coming months/years.\n\n\nAfter really understanding the tech aspects, I decided to buy some ETH to support the cause. I'm a software engineering student finishing college so I can't afford too much but I managed to save some money. It wasn't much but it's honest work hahaha. I finally was able to own some ETH, even if it's less than half ETH, I'm proud of it because this project, Ethereum, really represent the values of many people and what it's aiming to achieve it's very beautiful.\n\n\nOnce said that, I wanna say thanks to all developers working on Ethereum and also to the Ethereum community! \n\n\nBTW, if you guys know any job or someone that is paying in ETH let me know because I'm trying to get a job a soon :)\n\nI have strong programming skills but I also have experience writing and creating original content!

If there is any weakness in their network or downsides with their design and such. He would probably have a good understanding of their technology. That would be interesting to read! \n\nI tried googling and searching reddit to find it, but that didnt bring any luck.

mfymlg,1617049454,"OMG Network, Hashcast, Varna DEX, L2 Quasar Fast Exits","[https://omg.network/omg-labs-engineering-update-02-ft-varna/](https://omg.network/omg-labs-engineering-update-02-ft-varna/)\n\nIt's been a few months since OMG Network's (rebrand from OmiseGo) acquisition by GBV &amp; also a bit since it's been mentioned here on r/ethereum so I thought i'd share their latest update as well as my personal experience with the acquisition so far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecent Tech Updates:\n\nDevelopment wise it seems the OMG team (core developers stayed after acquisition) is speeding up and expanding to creating it's own apps such as Hashcast ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74p-MzXPsok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74p-MzXPsok)) and Varna DEX ([https://mobile.twitter.com/omgnetworkhq/status/1374344403569975296](https://mobile.twitter.com/omgnetworkhq/status/1374344403569975296)).\n\nHashcast seeks to coordinate Atomic Swap and is available for Developers to test from what i've read.\n\nVarna seeks to be the first decentralized exchange to prevent front-running by utilizing Hashcast.\n\nQuasar fast exits are also finished and in audit with a form of staking integrated in it's future release and hopefully will be utilized to decongest eth by the community as a whole with faster/cheaper transfers. Currently its a 2 week exit period which seems to be a huge deterrent towards network use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Personal Experience w/ Acquisition:\n\nOverall since the acquisition, imo, GBV has proven to be beneficial to OMG as a whole. \n\nThe new (management) team definitely seems to be more focused on creating apps and value that can be used sooner rather than later which I think is a great change of pace. They are also working on new tech and innovations that have yet to be done within crypto AFAIK. I'm happy they are pushing towards innovation &amp; products instead of attempting 1 big catch as the previous team attempted (and failed to do).\n\nThe OMG Labs engineering updates are an attempt to communicate more with the community with solid progress based updates rather than promises and the head honchos frequently (less frequently lately) pop into the OMG telegram chat and give their thoughts. More communication is always good IMO so no complaints here but even more is always nicer.\n\nHOWEVER, the successfulness will really come down to the utilization of the OMG Network. GBV has made it clear that this is their #1 focus and it seems Hashcat, Varna, and Quasar all hope to add towards the network use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; GBV is trying to make OMG network utilized more with new Apps &amp; fast exits, short term success will depend on if it works.\n\nFor anyone that wants to stay up to date, the Official Telegram is where most news pops first. Following the twitter is also a solution.

mg1fux,1617057266,Why is a DAG memory hard?,"I'm wondering what specifically about a directed acyclic graph is more memory hard than say, a deterministic large pool?  As I understand it, ASIC resistance is achieved by creating lots of large memory access, thereby reducing the value of compute only modules and forcing multi-die ASIC solutions which will be less $/mhz bandwidth efficient.\n\nSo what if, instead of the DAG, I take the prior block hash, run it through a series of general purpose operations (add/div/mult/xor/etc) and then make a huge pool of these numbers based on that.  I create 4GB of numeric garbage instead of a DAG.  Then the hashing algo takes the nonce (in the header) and mixes in N rounds of chunks (say 256 bytes) of data taken from this big garbage dump of data to make the final hash for difficulty compare.  Every full node can calc it because its deterministic (based on prior block hash) and there's no easy way to pre-calc it; you have to have high memory bandwidth.  If the garbage builder takes too long then set it on an epoch (rebuild every N blocks).\n\nJust wondering what is special about the DAG vs some other assembled block of data.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mg1fux/why_is_a_dag_memory_hard/,1,0
