l2wcjl,1611347507,"The security level of PoW networks should be measure in dollars, and it should reflect the cost of executing a 51% attack.","Equating hashrates  to network security is yet another huge false narrative in the crypto space that needs to be debunked. PoW works as a resource intensive activity. Its security is a function of the aggregated cost of mining equipment depreciation and operation. The purpose of PoW is to allow for a decentralized operation of the network. This consensus mechanism is effective at achieving this as long as no single entity controls 51% or more of the processing power of the network. The perpetrator evaluates the feasibility and profitability of the attack by calculating how much it would cost to successfully execute it. Hashrates are a factor of this calculation, but what really matters is the $ cost. This is why hash rate is a not a good security metric. This results in two main implications:\n\n* It is impossible to compare BTC's with ETH's security level by looking at hashrates alone because each uses a different hash function with dramatically different costs.\n* Mining hardware becomes more efficient and cheaper over time, this means that the hash rate of a network must go up in order to maintain the same level of security over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCost of a 51% attack: \n\n51% of total aggregated cost mining cost (hardware deprecation + electricity) \* number of blocks needed to sustain the attack \* time per block",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l2wcjl/the_security_level_of_pow_networks_should_be/,1,150
