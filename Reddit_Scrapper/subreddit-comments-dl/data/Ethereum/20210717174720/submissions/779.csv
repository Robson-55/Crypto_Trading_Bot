o0lh44,1623782637,Building an ecosystem of think-tank DAOs on Ethereum,"I've been wondering about the prospects, operationally and financially, of establishing a research unit as a DAO, one whose procurement of intellectual content may be monetizable via native currency, be it ETH or some more specialized one built upon Ethereum.\n\nAre there any examples of think tanks, schools, or other research-based institutions launched as DAOs? Any legacy institutions that have launched some kind of auxiliary DAO?\n\nProvided such an infrastructure is economically feasible, there could be good prospects for advancing the velocity of innovation across sectors, borders, and disciplines. As it is currently, there are mountains of open-source technical research, but I fear that the existing pathways of facilitating and delivering this research do not do it justice. I could be wrong, though.\n\nImagine the prospects of a constellation of decentralized research units, with considerably lower overhead than physically-embodied centers of research, each with as sharp a focus as it deems worthwhile. Researchers could be, in effect, traveling specialists without needing to leave their computer, so long as their academic acumen is translatable to blockchain-compatible terms. A sort of academic gig economy, but without the centralized likes of Uber, etc.\n\nIntellectual property (PDFs?) as NFTs? Decentralized peer review (edit: peer-to-peer review)? Smart contracts that govern credentials instead of human academic incumbents? Niche micro-MOOCs?\n\nIn a way we already see the seeds of this with the ecosystem of independent scholars using podcasts at their platforms. Just seems like a system that could benefit, one way or the other, from blockchain technology.\n\nAlso, my first thought was Ethereum, but it could be an interchain ecosystem, as far as I can tell.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o0lh44/building_an_ecosystem_of_thinktank_daos_on/,3,2

o0odga,1623790555,A Business Idea: Trading Pools Automated with Smart Contracts,"Yo guys, I'm just a trader with a very low coding skills. If you think I don't know what I am talking about, please tell me so. Also, please show me similar successful websites (not shady bs $5 bots). I know this is not the first time someone thinks an idea like that, so please don't bash me :)\n\n\--\n\nI've been trading crypto for some time now. I was asked, like most of us, for help trading. I helped some people learn, I traded for friends and family, etc. I was thinking what if I offered this as a service.\n\nThe idea goes like this: I have a pool in a contract. People can connect their wallets, and their funds are locked for a period of time. In the meantime, I trade using Uniswap. I get some percentage out of their profits automatically, the rest is delivered to their wallets. They can get their all money after a lockup period or whenever they want.\n\nIt can also be like a market place. The beauty of this would be all trades are open. They can see past data, trades, and results. So, trading pool owner won't be able to fake results as everything is in the blockchain.\n\nSomething like this can bring successful traders and investors together, like hedge funds. Yet, the hedge funds only work with big clients and they are not available to public. Successful traders cannot trade with other people's money, because, regulations and shit. So, this should solve a lot of problems.\n\nWhat do you guys think?  \n\n\nOne example (not affiliated)- -&gt; [https://zignaly.com/](https://zignaly.com/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o0odga/a_business_idea_trading_pools_automated_with/,3,14
