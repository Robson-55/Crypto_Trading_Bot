nhw5s9,1621613266,Just traded all my DOGE for more ETH,I've been planning this for a while and the dip provided an opportunity for me to swap all of my doge for more ETH at a decent rate.\n\nIt feels really good..sort of like passing on the baton between cryptos\n\nI know I'm going to miss out on those crazy wild swings but at a certain point tastes change and you start looking more to value and which direction technology is  shifting in as a whole. And positioning yourself in wiser ways.\n\nDoge is a great springboard for newcomers and I've made decent returns due to getting in early. Its been a lot of fun and I hope it continues to do well to provide people with similar opportunities\n\n‚úåÔ∏è,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nhw5s9/just_traded_all_my_doge_for_more_eth/,1,1

ni0r64,1621625350,Binance-Peg XRP and Binance-Peg Ethereum with TrustWallet in U.S.,"I know the title is quite long, but I've never tried to withdraw any crypto I've invested in on TrustWallet before. Saying that I'm frustrated and confused is by far an understatement. Pardon my ignorance with this post, but I am in need of some help here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI converted my crypto over to Ethereum (or so I thought) so I could send that ETH from TrustWallet to Uphold, since I know I can withdraw or cash-out when using Uphold. When I converted it to ETH, I now have ""Binance-Peg XRP."" I tried to convert some to Ethereum since I saw that, and then I received ""Binance-Peg Ethereum.""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter doing some digging, I saw that I would need to ""peg out,"" but the only way I've seen to do that is by using Binance Chain Extension (Bridge) but I'm unable to do so due to living in the United States apparently. So, needless to say... I'm stuck and don't see a way to retrieve my original investment nor my profits. I've been spending a bit in network fees and I really would like to see if there is anyone that could possibly help me with this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ni0r64/binancepeg_xrp_and_binancepeg_ethereum_with/,1,10
