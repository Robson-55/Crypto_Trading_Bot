huhx9p,1595234994,Ethercoin stuck in an Etherscan address.... HELP!," \n\nDear Ethereum Community,\n\nI am rather new to this Cryptocurrency realm and have encountered a conundrum. I purchased a Trezor One device, some Bitcoin and ETH recently. I transferred the Bitcoins with no problem to my Trezor device from the Kraken platform. I then attempted to send one Ethercoin (as a test) to my Trezor device. Unbeknownst to me, my Trezor device firmware had not been updated to receive the Ether coin. So, in brief, the Trezor device ushered me into the My Etherwallet Interface and in no way warned me that the device would be unable to receive the coin. Regardless, an address was generated during this process and I sent the coin. It was received into Etherscan but when I login to my Ether Wallet there is no indication the coin was received. I have been juggling messages from Etherscan support and Trezor support, yielding no solutions. Can anyone out there in Cryptoland help me understand how this happened and if indeed, my funds are lost? I see no way to access and transfer these funds. Has this ever happened to anyone out there? A steep and costly learning curve indeed. All input is very much appreciated. Thank You.
