lakkf8,1612230932,How a DAO could take the GME case to a different level," While it may rather seem to be a post for r/ethtrader, this is a post in which I try to make the case for how a DAO could supercharge what [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) did with GME: a collaborative attack on a billion Dollar hedgefund.\n\nI didn't know wallstreetbets before the short squeeze of the GameStop stock and as many people I had to read into what was actually happening. Skimming through media reports the narrative seemed to be plain and simple ""Reddit rascals tricking Wallstreet suits"". However, if you follow the topic closely on Reddit, you can clearly see that for some people including [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) (I highly recommend to check out this post on [r/video](https://www.reddit.com/r/video/) featuring his original analysis) this was neither a get-rich-quick scheme nor some joke. People really liked the idea to have the hedgefunds by the balls.\n\nI personally don't think that this sentiment will eventually last (although I hope to be proved wrong). There may be even more people on the Subreddit claiming to hold with diamond hands, however overall there is a lack of proof that people DID hold, contributing to an increasing lack of trust - because people don't know for sure what the majority plans to do or is already doing, people lose the ability to act as a collective.\n\nNow, dealing with a lack of trust even in an environment where people are highly suspicious of each other is somewhat the core feature of cryptocurrencies. A DAO that is able to buy stocks based on the vote of a group of people would allow investors to not only join forces but also to effectively eradicate the prisoners' dilemma that GME stock holders currently experience. This provides retail users with unprecedented powers.\n\nOf course, joining forces is possible for everyone, retail users and bankers - but the wallstreetbets case shows that in the end a viral social media movement can be pretty powerful, at least relatively. The people who would join forces by adding funds to a DAO gain mutual trust and the ability to share risk, but they likewise share the gains and by doing so reduce them heavily. This makes it much less attractive for those who are mainly interested in multiplying investments short-term - people with a political agenda (flip the bird to Wallstreet) won't see this as a problem..\n\nWhat would be needed is a DAO with a bridge to the stock market. Not as easy, but still possible in the very near future. I am half-sure, we might see this of solution within the next year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lakkf8/how_a_dao_could_take_the_gme_case_to_a_different/,27,40

I even think that long term Ethereum has a big chance of flipping the market cap of Bitcoin.\n\nI have a question about a potential risk with PoS that I have been thinking about.\n\nIt goes like this: Let's say we enter a bear market and the ETH price starts dropping rapidly. Because of this, many validators withdraw their staking funds since they want to sell. This causes even more selling pressure due to security FUD and the price just continues to waterfall down.\n\nWhat prevents this from occuring? I'm sure I am missing something here.\n\nPerhaps due to game theory many people would start staking to protect the security of the network, but in the end I believe most people are selfish and in it for the money and not for the tech.\n\nRemember, last bear market price dropped by over 90%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/laqmpg/a_possible_security_issue_with_proof_of_stake/,22,24
