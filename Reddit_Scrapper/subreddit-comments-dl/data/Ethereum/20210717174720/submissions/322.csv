l2e31e,1611282954,Staking rewards per year,I understand that based on how much eth is staked will determine the amount for the eth reward.

l2gptb,1611292294,How is Proof of Stake supposed to combat centralization?,"So from my naive understanding, Proof of Work is vulnerable to centralization because the integrity of the network lies in the hands of those with computing power, which is only realistically accessible by those who have lots of capital. (Correct me if I'm wrong--is it the integrity or survival of the network that is at risk?). \n\nAnd Proof of Stake aims to solve this by trusting people with more stake, or native token, to uphold the integrity of the network. But how is this different? If the people with the most money/token uphold the integrity of the network, how is this not running into the same problem of centralization?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l2gptb/how_is_proof_of_stake_supposed_to_combat/,1,166
