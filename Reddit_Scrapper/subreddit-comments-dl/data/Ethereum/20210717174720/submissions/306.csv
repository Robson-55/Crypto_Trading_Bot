kxh2g4,1610665036,"Guide: How to be sure your crypto lands at your loved ones after passing away- securely, cheap &amp; fun!","I want to write this guide because there isn't much available to redemy this problem, and I think I found a pretty good solution that's cheap, secure and kind of fun.\n\nBasicly, if you suddenly pass away, you'd want to make sure your loved ones receive your crypto, but you don't want to expose your private keys just yet. Here is how I did it after brainstorming quite a bit, which also allows you to easily make changes if you make a new wallet somewhere.\n\n**What you need:**\n\n1. Email addresses that do not contain both first and last names of your loved ones and yourself.\n2. \~10 Cheap NFC stickers. ($2)\n3. Android phone with the NFC Tools Pro app. ($3,50)\n4. At least 2 addresses you often visit, so perhaps more then a single person you know.\n\n**Alright i got it all, now what?**\n\n**Step 1. Putting the private keys securely online.**\n\nPut your computer offline if you want to be absolute secure. Now get all your private keys in seperate txt files on your computer. Install 7zip, then right click the private keys to add them to an archive. Put a good password on the archive then proceed creating the archive. Do this with every single private key txt file. Note: you can easily add notes to the private key txt files for your loved ones to understand how it works etc.\n\nAfter finishing up, select all private key password-protected zip files and add them to yet another archive, with a different password.\n\nUpload this archive file to your dropbox or google drive(as long as files are kept a good while, with these services they will, and make the link share-able by you.\n\n**Step 2. NFC Tag Writing.**\n\n(!) Again, to be secure, disable your data connections on your phone while proceeding. (airplane mode and be sure wifi is also off, but nfc is on)\n\nOpen the NFC Tools Pro app on your android device. You can easily find the menu's to add txt records, this is where you want to copy the link to the archive on every single NFC tag. Now, split the password in half and put the first half on half of the nfc tags you have. and the other half of the password to the other nfc tags you have. Of course, make a note in the nfc tag that they have to ask for the other person in order to get the password back together.\n\nProceed writing all the data to the nfc tags, be sure to remember what nfc tag has what data so you dont accidently put two of the same in a single house.\n\n(!) Now, delete the app from your android device, so you are certain the data you have entered on your device could never in any way arrive online. Then you can re-install it again as a clean start.\n\n**Step 3. Hide all the NFC tags.**\n\nThis is where the fun starts! Hide the NFC tags in both houses/places. NFC stickers can be extremely small and thin, so you can get them anywhere! This makes sure a object that is thrown away or by odd luck a nfc sticker dies, you always have backups! Of course, remember the locations and write them down.\n\n**Step 4. Dead man switch service.**\n\nGet a dead man switch email service. For example [https://www.deadmantracker.com/](https://www.deadmantracker.com/).\n\nSign up and add the email addresses of your loved ones. In the email, give the locations of the nfc tags with some instructions. Even if this dead man switch gets hacked, the hacker will have no idea of the houses where these trackers are located, and therefore the stolen data is useless to the hacker. This changes a lot if the email address has the first and last name in it, so dont use those kind of email addresses!\n\nThe service will simply email you in self-set intervals to check if you're still alive. Simply click the link and you're set. If you miss a link, you can sometimes also set reminders. Of course, failing to then reply to the reminder results in your ""last will"" message being send to your loved ones, resulting in your private keys landing into their hands!\n\nCheap, secure and kind of fun to hide the tags around!\n\nHope this helps, and feel free to share it around! ....Or don't, and therefore increase the scarcity of the coins and tokens so I may profit upon your deaths :P\n\n Note: Posted this first in [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/) but felt this is important for other community's as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kxh2g4/guide_how_to_be_sure_your_crypto_lands_at_your/,2,3

kxksev,1610677224,Ethereum Tokenomics: SUPPLY SHOCK IS COMING! Investors will accumulate as much as possible," \n\nEthereum officially launched in July 2015 with a pre-mine of 72 Million ETH tokens. The founders also put a max inflation for the coin at 18M ETH per year. With the current total token supply at around 114M tokens, it is clear that we never hit the max inflation of 18M coins. That puts the inflation rate at on average around 8% per year. Considering that Ethereum does not have a max supply of tokens like bitcoin does, it could be asked what will make the price rise in the long term if the token supply gets inflated every year.\n\nCurrently, the reason the price of Ethereum rises is simply because the demand of the coin is higher than the inflation rate. In addition to an increase in demand, it can be predicted that many ETH are lost every year which also makes the inflation seem higher than it actually is. But as the demand for Ethereum starts to flatten out (which could take years), does this mean investors can expect the price of ETH to decline around 8% annually in the future? The quick answer to this question is no. Even with an 8% inflation rate, this inflation should never affect the the ETH price because of Ethereum 2.0. Below are some of the implications that come with Ethereum 2.0 that is set to push the Ethereum price higher.\n\n**1.) Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain lock up:** Ethereum is still a work in progress. Currently, (as said by Vitalik) the Ethereum we use today is an attempt at making a world super computer. Ethereum 2.0 will be a world super computer. In order to get Ethereum to upgrade to 2.0, the network first needs to launch a beacon chain. This beacon chain requires a minimum of approx. 524k ETH to be locked up and stay locked until Ethereum 2.0 is launched. This beacon chain was launched on December 1st, and currently there is 2.5M ETH locked up that will not be able to be unlocked for at least \~18 months.\n\n**2.) Proof of Stake:** As Ethereum 2.0 gets closer, there will be more platforms that will allow for easy staking on the Ethereum. As staking becomes more user friendly, it can be expected that more people will stake their ETH to receive rewards. With 2.5M currently staked, we may see this number double or triple over the coming year as more people will want to become an Ethereum 2.0 staker.\n\n**3.) EIP 1559:** Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 is a token burning model that will burn the base transaction fee of every Ethereum transaction. This means that the more Ethereum transactions that occur on the network, the more ETH that will be burned; thus removing ETH from the network forever. This is expected to decrease the inflation rate to around 2% or less. Many believe that this improvement will actually result in ETH being deflationary, meaning the total supply of ETH goes down every year. The code for EIP 1559 actually is already finished and this model will be implemented with the next Ethereum upgrade.\n\nAlthough Ethereum currently has a high inflation rate, this is very close to changing. With over 2.5M ETH locked up, it can be argued that there is already a supply shock for the amount of tokens available to buy. In addition, with the token burning mechanism that will be implemented with Ethereum 2.0, that could result in a rush to accumulate as much ETH as possible before the system upgrade.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to know what the Ethereum price will be in the coming years, there are many reasons to believe that it will become in higher demand than bitcoin. Being that Ethereum will be needed to do transactions, if there is a supply shock and a demand spike happening simultaneously, the coin may reach price levels that many may not expect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kxksev/ethereum_tokenomics_supply_shock_is_coming/,1,10
