ntxfmj,1623018596,Would shorter block times reduce MEV?,"Assumption: blocks are twice as frequent and have half the blockspace each (so blockspace per time remains constant)\n\nDoes this reduce MEV per time? (say 2 quicker &amp; smaller vs 1 regular block)\n\n\nThe thought I had:\n\nAs a simplification let's assume there are n transactions in a small &amp; quick block and the miner can decide their order (this absolutely simplifies how the mempool and MEV works, maybe this is a critical flaw in my thought?). \nThere are n! possible permutations for how transactions can be ordered combinatorically. In two of the small &amp; quick blocks, miners hence have 2*(n!) of options. The regular block holds 2n transactions which allow (2*n)! permutations.\n\nAs 2*(n!) &lt; (2*n)!, n&gt;1, the optionality is superadditive, ie bigger, when combining the two smaller &amp; quicker blocks. If MEV is a function of optionality, the smaller blocks would reduce MEV per time.\n\n\nAny ideas/existing material on this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ntxfmj/would_shorter_block_times_reduce_mev/,1,5
