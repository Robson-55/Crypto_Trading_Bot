j1vvph,1601371092,When will ethereum mining stop working?,"I could have sworn that I read somewhere that during the switchover to ETH2 mining was going to change, where a percentage of the mining would go to miners and a percent to staking, but now after a couple of hours of trying to find where I read that, not only did I not find it but I also could find nothing at all about when mining would actually stop working, or what happens on the day it does, or how to sell existing coins, or anything that would give me actual practical information to plan on the upcoming change. \n\nAll I could find were either repetitive rudimentary explanations of what PoW vs PoS is, or why it's going to happen, or what the roadmap looks like (again, without any details of how things will actually play out), or speculations on what will happen to the price, yadda yadda yadda etc etc and so on. \n\nIs it going to go from ""mining works fine, we're good"" to ""damn, nothing is happening"" at the flip of a switch?
