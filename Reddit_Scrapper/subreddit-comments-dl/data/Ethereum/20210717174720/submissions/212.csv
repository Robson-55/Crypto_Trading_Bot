Hopefully it helps to onboard more stakers during the testing phase.\n\nFor those who want to get a feeling for how it is to operate a staking node in a testnet right now, if you are a bit familiar with ansible, feel free to use and abuse this ansible role:\n\n* [ethereum_validator on ansible-galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/maximilianmeister/ethereum_validator)\n* [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/MaximilianMeister/ethereum-validator)\n\nYou can see it as an installer that automates manual steps to provision a server.\n\nFor the default scenario it is enough to have docker and molecule installed to run your node locally in a containerized environment.\n\nThe role can of course also be used to target a remote node for provisioning.\n\nThanks to /u/SomerEsat for the [great guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ju4rq4/psa_my_ethereum_20_staking_guides_medalla_testnet/) on how to set things up, and also thanks to all the others involved in making staking on the testnet such a good experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jwnma4/easy_setup_of_an_eth_20_staking_node/,2,1

DeFi has boomed under Ethereum. Will it expand or contract with Etheruem 2.0.\n\n4. Will ethereum 2.0 allow for stable coins to make payments instantly at checkout lines or will the delay still be awkward?

Does anyone know a good tutorial or lesson that would help me do this? Here is the assignment: \n\nCreate an application that will collect data from the Ethereum blockchain about transactions associated with a specific wallet address that the user inputs. The app should get information on the wallets (addresses) and amounts of ETH associated with transactions made to and from a certain given wallet and either store them in a database of choice or show them in a simple human-readable way (ideally, through a web page). Collect transaction data starting from a given block (do not crawl the entire blockchain).\n\n**Example**: If a user requests to view transactions associated with the address *0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f* from block *9000000* to the current block it should be able to crawl and visualize all transaction data (addresses that sent to and received tokens from address *0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f* , and how much ETH was used for a given transaction) in that period of time.  \n\n\nthank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jx09hc/need_an_ethereum_transaction_crawler_app/,3,4
