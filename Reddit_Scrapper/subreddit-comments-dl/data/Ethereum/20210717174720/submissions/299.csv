One thing I recently came across, that I sort of find jarring, is the fact that it seems all smart contracts code are available in the open.\n\nFor example \n\nWrapped BTC (WBTC): https://etherscan.io/address/0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599#code\n\nor \n\nCryptoKitties: https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1690c08e213a35ed9bab7b318de14420fb57d8c/#code\n\nMy question is, if this is the case, how do people monetize and protect their intellectual rights over their smart contracts?
