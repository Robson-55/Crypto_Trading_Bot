nlijwl,1622039802,How much network traffic can I expect from an Ethereum full node?,"I'm thinking of setting up an ethereum full node using a spare computer (512GB SSD + 8GB RAM).

nlj416,1622041290,Ethereum’s new Meta-DEX-Aggregator to save users from MEV,"We recently announced the launch of Gnosis Protocol V2 (GPv2). You can start trading today on the alpha CowSwap dapp [https://cowswap.exchange/#/](https://cowswap.exchange/#/) built on GPv2.\n\nGnosis Protocol V2 leverages batch auctions to provide MEV protection, plus integration with liquidity sources across DEXs, to offer traders the best prices.\n\nInitially [defined by Phil Daian](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05234), MEV is a measure of the profit a miner (or validator, sequencer, etc.) can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce.\n\nGnosis Protocol V2 (GPv2) is the missing DeFi component Ethereum’s infrastructure needs. It allows users to enjoy the benefits of MEV protection because it's built with three important considerations in mind. The three main characteristics (from less important to most important) that make GPv2 stand out from other protocols are:\n\n1. Access to on-chain liquidity with strict enforcement for malicious behavior.\n2. Off-chain orders via signed messages.\n3. Price finding mechanisms based on batch auctions with uniform clearing prices and Coincidence of Wants (COWs).\n\nYou can find more information at: [https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-gnosis-protocol-v2-and-balancer-gnosis-protocol-f693b2938ae4](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-gnosis-protocol-v2-and-balancer-gnosis-protocol-f693b2938ae4) \n\nYou can start trading at [https://cowswap.exchange/#/](https://cowswap.exchange/#/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nlj416/ethereums_new_metadexaggregator_to_save_users/,1,2

nlnxor,1622053753,Questions about ERC,"Hello, I have been actively studying the ethereum blockchain for a while and I keep getting ahead of myself with all the directions people can take. I see an exhaustive list on github with all the known major token standards (there seems to be like 30 differents kinds). But no matter where I search, there are a few things I can't seem to find. I wonder if someone can clear a few things up for me or maybe explain to me where my understanding is incorrect. I would also love some pointers on places to learn more about ethereum or places to learn about blockchain technology in general. Thank you!\n\n1. I understand that these standards were made to simplify the process of a token being accepted onto an exchange so that it can be swapped with other tokens. Can you make a token with a contract that isn't based on one of these ""standards?""\n2. If so, how hard would it be to get such a token on an exchange? I can't imagine an exchange would charge so much if all they had to do was code a little bit to accept your token, right?\n3. I hear that smart contracts, once made, cannot be changed.
