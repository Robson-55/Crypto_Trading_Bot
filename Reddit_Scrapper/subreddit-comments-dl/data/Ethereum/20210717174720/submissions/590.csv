n3bckk,1619976532,Question regarding ETH2 staking on Coinbase?,"So  I have some ETH on Coinbase. I'm off a waitlist to stake my ETH now. So  my question is this. When I stake my ETH it gets locked up and I'm not  able to buy/sell the staked ETH until ETH2 comes around (PoS)?\n\nSo will this staked ""ETH"" be actual ETH or will it be exchanged for some holding token called ETH2?\n\nBasically,  I would like to stake ETH to earn ""staking"" rewards but at the same  time I want to benefit from any gains that ETH experiences.\n\nSo  for any of you already staking ETH2 on Coinbase can you help me out  before I decide to pull the trigger. I personally believe ETH gains in  the coming months will be more than the 6% APR that staking offers. So  will I be able to get both the 6% APR from staking and still earn gains  on my ETH?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n3bckk/question_regarding_eth2_staking_on_coinbase/,1,46

Do have to pay a premium to make the transaction private, or will their costs be equivalent once cryptocurrency tech evolves far enough?\n\nI am familiar with the various options for private transactions in cryptocurrency. What I am interested in learning is whether, in the long run, most transactions worldwide will likely be openly accessible. Of course private transactions will still occur even if they are at a relative premium.\n\nThe implications of this on the global economy would be really interesting if so!
