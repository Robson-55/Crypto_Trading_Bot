n8wtj4,1620624564,EIP 1559 - could the burn fees offset pump and dump price dives?,"I have read a few things about what EIP 1559 could mean - and I know a huge part of the stated objective is to normalize gas fees, but is the burn fee also intended to offset a price dive from unloading a bunch of eth? \n\nI'm guessing part of the price climb right now has to do with people knowing that EIP 1559 is an improvement that can make eth more valuable in July.  The speculation  alone I'm sure is contributing to the price increase.\n\nTheoretically tho, would a fair amount of folks suddenly selling eth in July at (possibly all time highs) cause more burn fees which - realistically might offset a kind of pump and dump situation of a destabilization / price dive? \n\nIn my most conservative guess, I can imagine that it could be algorithmically set to basically smooth out dives into dips by optimizing the circulation. The supply and demand of eth would thereby have a kind of healthy feedback loop that decreases volitility and promotes growth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n8wtj4/eip_1559_could_the_burn_fees_offset_pump_and_dump/,1,14
n8ww94,1620624861,Will staking rewards increase after the ETH2 merge?,"Right now stakers are getting ~7% return but will that amount increase after POW is eliminated?\n\nI saw someone post last week saying that returns could be as high as 25% after the merge because stakers will be getting the rewards that are currently going to miners. \n\nBut I haven’t seen anyone else back that up. (IIRC, this claim came from an ETH2 developer. Can’t find the thread…) \n\nAnyone know if the staking rewards will increase after ETH2 and POS take over?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n8ww94/will_staking_rewards_increase_after_the_eth2_merge/,1,83
