Call for thoughts and submissions.,"Friends,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been a long, long LONG time since we had a bit of a makeover here on r/ethereum. Fun fact (as pointed out on twitter): [the block number featured in the current header](https://twitter.com/_czepluch/status/1346235878449029122?s=19) reflects the date of 7 Aug, 2015.  That said, this thing has probably seen enough blocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA suggestion was made after a mod discussion to call for submissions and ethereum-related art to use in the header spot! Now, rather than making a contest out of it, we'd like to just do a better job to more regularly spruce up the place using some of what comes in if that sounds alright. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said, anything that's free or open source is fair game. Whether it's a copy of an NFT that you own, the graphics from industry teams or [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org), your old posts from r/EthereumArtists or more -- feel free to throw them in below!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd if this sounds great to you, who0o!
