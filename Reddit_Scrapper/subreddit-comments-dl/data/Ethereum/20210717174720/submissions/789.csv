o3hybh,1624114832,The Ethereum Merge to Full POS Still Planned for End of 2021," ""If all goes as planned, the Eth1 and Eth2 merge should be completed in December this year . . .""\n\n[https://btcmanager.com/prysmatic-labs-eth2-development/](https://btcmanager.com/prysmatic-labs-eth2-development/)\n\n""Proof of Stake (PoS) is coming to Ethereum, perhaps by the end of the year, definitely by early 2022.""\n\n[https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/charting-the-path-to-proof-of-stake-ethereum/](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/charting-the-path-to-proof-of-stake-ethereum/)\n\nNo, Vitalik did not ""delay"" the merge to POS. No, it isn't going to happen end of 2022. No, the fake article that you might have read proclaiming the supposed delay was based on a comment that was taken out of context. That said, there is a possibility that the merge is pushed into early 2022, but the plan is still for it to happen in December, 2021.\n\nOnce the full merge to POS happens, Ethereum will highly likely become deflationary (due to the combined effects of EIP 1559 and POS). This means that there will be fewer ETH in existence year after year. Some estimates suggest that the total existing supply of ETH will decrease from about 115M today to about 100M over the course of the next decade (source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQTZSb3Rc9I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQTZSb3Rc9I)). Strap up, because ETH is about to become very, very scarce.\n\nTLDR: The ""ETH has been delayed again FUD"" that you might have heard or read recently was based on fake news.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o3hybh/the_ethereum_merge_to_full_pos_still_planned_for/,38,241
