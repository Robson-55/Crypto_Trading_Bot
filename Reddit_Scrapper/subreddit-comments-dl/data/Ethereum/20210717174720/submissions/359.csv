lc5n1l,1612407033,A College Student w/ Qs,I‚Äôm currently in an MBA level marketing class in school. If I posted a real survey about crypto and banking how likely are you to take it? It‚Äôs for personal use but also for a survey for a current project to be able to present data to a bank about how their customers use online services.\n\nI want to expand it on a different level - to the use of cryptos and how banks (and their online resources) market towards people investing or ‚Äúbanking‚Äù with crypto wallets.\n\nThanks for your time!,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lc5n1l/a_college_student_w_qs/,3,1
