Some thoughts...,"In advance of the launch of the ETH2.0 beacon chain, I think it would be incredibly helpful for some of the sysadmins in the Ethereum community to post some best practices on validator security (hardware and cloud).  Given that it is likely that there will be many enthusiasts staking in the first few months and that most will not be security experts, having a few articles on the topic would be great.  And cryptographic key security is only one aspect.  Best practices on firewall setup, physical security and cloud security would all be valuable I think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/iu3irp/validator_security_some_thoughts/,1,8
