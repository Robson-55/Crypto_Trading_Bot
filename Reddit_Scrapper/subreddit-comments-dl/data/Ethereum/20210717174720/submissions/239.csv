k7oyrd,1607238094,Where do you store your 24-word seed? Need suggestions to improve my security of funds in a non-custodial account," I have a 24-word seed from EarnBet-an online decentralized casino with which I have a decent amount of $BET staked. I wrote the phrase on a piece of paper.  I then decided to write it on a password program like lastpass/keepass.  So in order to get into the lastpass, you need a password.  And i put the lastpass in dropbox/google drive and store it there.  My thought was if someone somehow hacked into my Gmail/dropbox, well they still need the password to my lastpass in order to get into my EarnBet seed.  I put the EarnBet seed in there as I type it out along with my other bank account details and other financial information. \n\nSo I only have the seed written on a piece of paper which I have in the house.  But of course, things could happen like fire, floods, etc.  So what is the best way to store your seed to prevent this?  Did I heard of cryptosteel where it's fireproof and floodproof so that works?  But isn't the issue if someone finds it, well it's pretty easy to see oh why is there a bunch of long words and some ppl might even figure out it's the seed of a wallet?\n\nNow if you write the seed in a notebook with a ton of stuff there, well that would be hard for someone to find.  Imagine like you have a notebook where you have the seed there but also in the first few pages write down like nursery school rhyme or children books and lot of stuff like that, well obviously it won't look like its important.\n\nAlso, I hear ppl say break your seed into two or three parts.  That makes sense but do you leave all the parts in the same house/apartment?  You hear about how you give one half to someone else you trust, you keep the second half.  Well what if you no longer see the other person anymore or something happens, then what?  Obviously, you would need to immediately send your coins to a temporary wallet in the meantime.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/k7oyrd/where_do_you_store_your_24word_seed_need/,1,1

I know that you can generate those keys to receive crypto from for example Kraken or Coinbase, but I was wondering if it is also safe to share that receive code with another person that wants to send you crypto?

k80rox,1607284644,Mechanism to travel through blockchain historical state,"I'm looking for a way to set my ganache (or node or infura or anything) environment so that it is set pointing to a paricular block number and then allow me to run a series of view contract executions (no update of ethereum state) primarily run uniswap pair price analysis and kyber price analysis, then increment the block, and then run the same series of view contract executions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe purpose is really to just gain historical price information\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have seen for uniswap you potentially can get the price information using the subgraph ([https://www.reddit.com/r/UniSwap/comments/jfx8a6/getting\_historical\_data\_1h\_data\_from\_subgraph/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/UniSwap/comments/jfx8a6/getting_historical_data_1h_data_from_subgraph/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)), which is what [https://info.uniswap.org/home](https://info.uniswap.org/home) to fetch its historical data.

Fetch the next block number details from infura ()\n\n4. find a method or way that allows me to add the block to the ganache local fork (fingers cross this exists and is not too complicated to do)\n\n5.
