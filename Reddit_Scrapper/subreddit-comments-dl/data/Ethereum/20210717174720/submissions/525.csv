But since I have gotten into crypto just for my own personal finances, I have become more enthralled with the idea of switching gears and going back to school to reconfigure myself towards doing computer science or software engineering. Not only do I love programming, but I love crypto, so it seems like something worth considering. \n\nSo I'd be curious to here from any people who work with Ethereum as a technology if they would recommend software engineering or computer science to do this. I would also consider teaching myself, because I find it easy, but I am just playing around with the idea currently.
