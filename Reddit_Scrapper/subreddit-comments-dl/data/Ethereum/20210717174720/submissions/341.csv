But lately ETH foundation (team) is so late on delivering staking. Other guys have it already why is it so hard ? I am a software dev.

l95jmi,1612070951,Ethereum contract for car sale in negative equity,"new to crypto and Solidity. I'm trying to sell a car that I still have monthly payments on. I have a car in my possession currently in negative equity. In other words, just to get out of this shitty situation I would need to pay another $5,000 to lienholder after Dealership pays the $11,000 to the lienholder. \n\nAs an alternative, i'm interested in the possibility of creating a smart contract with the next person who wants the car-asset in their possession. I'd continue making my loan payments in USD with my ""USD credit identity"". The ETH paid by the new car-asset-holder would help me make the payments. The monthly payments would be nominated in DAI.  \n\n\nAny tips from proficient Solidity Developers? Is this possible or just silly?
