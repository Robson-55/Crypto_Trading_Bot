Defi vs Cefi,"Hi!\n\n  \nI'm about to start earning some passive income on my eth trough nexo because i feel like it's one of the safest bets and also has pretty good APY.\n\n  \nI'd like to know your thoughts, and what are you guys using to earn passive income on your eth?  What are the Defi and Cefi options that you've been using and liking the most?  \n\n\nI'm also considering ""yield app"" but honestly i wouldn't feel as safe as i would using Nexo.
