I understand why it is necessary for atleast a few nodes to have the full blockchain so people can still view information on early blocks, but it just seems like a restriction that discourages new users from wanting their own master node.\n\nIf blocks are truly dependent on the hash from the previous block, then just a chain of 2-3 seems plenty tamper proof on its own.
