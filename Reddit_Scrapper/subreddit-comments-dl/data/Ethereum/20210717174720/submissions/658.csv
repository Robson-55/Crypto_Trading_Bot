nazghm,1620853680,THOUGHTS?,"“Ethereum price discovers resistance at Fibonacci extension\nOver the last seven weeks of gains, Ethereum price has rallied almost 150%, establishing it as one of the best seven-week periods in the history of the altcoin. As a result, daily and weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings strike an overbought condition. Still, in the case of the daily RSI, there is no bearish momentum divergence that could undermine the medium-term bullish outlook.\n\nFor the last three days, Ethereum price has struggled with the 361.8% Fibonacci extension of the April 22-23 decline at $4,232. Part of the restlessness can be attributed to the magnet effect of large round numbers, in this case, $4,000.\n\nDue to the overbought condition and a potential unfolding of a collective top in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum price could undergo a corrective process that may test the 261.8% extension of the 2018 decline at $3,587, or even the 38.2% retracement of the February-May advance at $3,202.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nazghm/thoughts/,1,0
