j7x0nd,1602241948,"xDAI to DAI conversion, DAI missing","Hi guys,\n\nI didn't know where else to post this so thought I'd try here. Hopefuly someone can at least point me in the right direction.\n\nYesterday I wanted to trade my Reddit Moon tokens for DAI and did the same process I've done several times in the past. Moons to xMoons, DAI to xDAI, selling the xMoons for xDAI, then trading the xDAI back for DAI on [xmoon.exchange](https://xmoon.exchange). Never had any problems but this time, the DAI never showed up in my wallet. It's been 13 hours now ...\n\nI checked the txID and compared it to previous transactions and it looks identical. The only difference being my DAI not showing up. I tried reaching out to the folks behind [xmoon.exchange](https://xmoon.exchange) but couldn't get a response. And apparantly I'm not the only one in this boat.\n\nSo what do I do now? Do I just keep waiting and hope it eventually shows up in my wallet? I looked into the xDAI transaction info and couldn't find anywhere to do cancel or redo or increase fees or anything of the sort.\n\nI'd appreciate any advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/j7x0nd/xdai_to_dai_conversion_dai_missing/,1,1
