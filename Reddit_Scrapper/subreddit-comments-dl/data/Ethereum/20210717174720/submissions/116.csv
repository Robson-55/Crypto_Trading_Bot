id241e,1597891219,"NEST is a very popular token and oracle in China but there is very little talk of it in the west, what do you think about its unique oracle model when compared to Chainlink or Uniswap/Kyber?","How NEST works in a nutshell:\n\nLet's assume the actual market price of ETH is 200 USDT\n\nAlice submits a request to the oracle contract stating that one ETH equals 200 USDT. To complete this request she submits 10 ETH and 2000 USDT. A 1% commission of the ETH is sent to the NEST dividend contract and in return Alice receives NEST tokens at a discount. Nobody challenges this price as it is accurate and/or the price has not shifted nor does anyone wish to manipulate the price. \n\nBob tries to mess with the oracle by stating that the price of ETH is actually 100 USDT not 200 USDT. He submits 10 ETH and 1000 USDT.\n\nBecause Bob's price is artificially low, an arbitrageur, Charlie buys the 10 ETH from Bob for only 1000 USDT and gets a 50% discount.\n\nThe opposite is also true, if Bob submits an artificially high price, someone will sell their ETH for the higher price and make a profit. \n\nHowever, to make this purchase, Charlie must submit a counter price request at 2x the rate. Therefore if Charlie buys this artificially low offer, he has to also propose a price (let's say the actual at 200 USDT) x2: 20 ETH, 4000 USDT (no commission). This mechanism exists to prevent manipulators who distort accurate prices to attack a contract. \n\nThe final price is given over to the oracle and Charlie is refunded his counter request deposit. Each price request has a 5 minute time window before it is submitted to the oracle.\n\nThe 1% commission provided by Alice is distributed to NEST token holders and the NEST token is used for governance as well. \n\nI find this model very interesting for the following reasons:\n\n1. It heavily punishes false prices and manipulation\n2. Unlike uniswap, it cannot be easily manipulated by flash loans or slippage\n3. The less users there are, the more incentive there is to punish liars. This creates a cycle where it encourages participation and eventually leads to a lot of participants giving accurate information\n4. This oracle can be used as a source of truth for other DEXES\n\nHow do you think this compares to the other oracles/sources of truth that currently exist in the west?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/id241e/nest_is_a_very_popular_token_and_oracle_in_china/,1,2
