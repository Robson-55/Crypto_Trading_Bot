ICO sale,"  \n\n*Processing img c56mskr3dhe61...*\n\nYPRO token holders will be able to earn passive returns by depositing and locking up YPRO and LPs tokens to our farms or by staking these tokens. In the future there will be more options to get reward, because we're planning to launch YPro.Governance, YPro.Vaults and YPro.Lending and YPro.Borrow platforms.\n\n   \n \n\n*Processing img bnu7td74dhe61...*\n\n   \n \n\n*Processing img qb1enru4dhe61...*\n\n*Processing img rp6wgou4dhe61...*\n\n*Processing img 8jfl9qu4dhe61...*\n\n YPRO Token ($YPRO) is the governance token of [YPro.Finance](https://ypro.finance/) platform. Right now we are working on developing and launching three main products - yield farming platform ([YPro.Finance/farm](https://ypro.finance/farm)) - (launch date: 25 February 2021), token staking platform (YPro.Stake) (predicted launch date: Q2 2021) and a protocol for exchanging ERC-20 tokens (YPro.Swap) (predicted launch date: Q2 2021).\n\n**YPro Farm launch information: (Public launch 25 February 2021)**\n\nYPro.Farm platform is nearly completed and will be officialy launch to public on 25 February 2021. (After YPro Token sale)\n\nIt is a DeFi App, being technically supported with smart contract YPro Farm Token (YPF).\n\nAnyone holding Uniswap LP tokens can stake those LP tokens into the corresponding initial list of pools. Once done, they will start earning YPF tokens as reward.\n\nThe list of eligible LP tokens can be added per on-chain governance.\n\nAt every block, 150 YPF tokens will be created. These tokens will be equally distributed to the stakers of each of the supported pools.\n\n**Important!** As the introductory launch offer, the platform will generate 4x more YPF rewards per block (600 YPF) during the first 7 days after launch, divided by the proportional share of the pool. The exception to this will be ‚ÄúYPRO/YPRO‚Äù pool which will have a 4x proportional share as compared to other pools. After 7 days, the reward will be set to 150 YPF per block.\n\nCheck short video presenting how our farm works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVJLpKWvfI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVJLpKWvfI%20) (test mode) \n\n**YPRO Tokenomics:**\n\nName: YPro Token\n\nSymbol: YPRO\n\nDecimals: 18\n\nTotal Supply: 250,000 YPRO\n\nSmart Contract: 0x067085aA0FF4e97A3C61BF06DE618E0aAe11DBc2\n\n**II Stage Token Sale information:**\n\nDate of sale: 30.01.2021-04.02.2021\n\nAvailable tokens: 27 272 YPRO + 2 727 YPRO bonusses\n\nYPro Token price: 0.8 USDT / 0.0006 ETH\n\nBonus tokens: 10%\n\nVisit website for more information and YPRO buy: [YPro.finance](https://ypro.finance/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l8mvyf/yprofinance_great_defi_project_ico_sale/,1,1
