How are the rewards calculated approximately, assuming that a validator is always online?\n2. As it is a simple Proof of Stake validation, do I need a powerful host to maintain my validator? i.e. can I just use a Raspberry pi? What is the expected load in terms of CPU?\n3. What are the approximate storage requirements in HDD space? \n4. Can a validator cash out the 32ETH + any accumulated rewards at any point and walk away?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lm42xa/eth2_validator_staking_questions/,1,8
