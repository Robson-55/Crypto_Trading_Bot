l9ta8x,1612148926,"Stablecoins: winner takes all? or, what is the argument for variety?","Is it a necessary conclusion that there will be one stablecoin to rule them all?\n\nAs a savvy but non-technical evangelist and follower of Ethereum for 4+ years (meaning, I generally ""get it,"" though the technical aspects can fly over my head at times), I don't need an ELI5 on stablecoins. However, I do feel as though I am missing something. Is it as simple as: there will be as many stablecoins as the market demands? That markets love variety, and if these coins offer different savings rates, governance etc., end users will flow toward those where they find value? Or will network effects necessitate a flow toward a single superior coin?\n\nPut another way: (aside from being a crypto purist who is wary of legacy institutions -- sure, a reason in and of itself, but let's put that aside for now) why would one elect to hold Dai over USDC? What about Dai vs. DeFiDollar? Etc. etc.\n\nThanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l9ta8x/stablecoins_winner_takes_all_or_what_is_the/,1,2

l9u1pq,1612151409,Something peculiar about discussions on ethereum inflation vs fiat USD inflation rates,A concern some have discussed is that eth inflation is similar to fiat because there is no hard cap so it is inflated on a regular basis. There are a lot of valid reasons why eth inflation is more sustainable than fiat but I realized no one is talking about a major fundamental difference in fiat inflation vs ethereum inflation. When we discuss ether inflation we are using the literal percentage of newly issued coins each year. Inflation rates for USD are not calculated this way and if we did want to compare direct inflation in terms of money printed each year it is wayyy more than 2-3% a year. More like 10-30+% annual increase in base currency for the past decade. I just started thinking about this a lot and I don‚Äôt think anyone is really talking about it...,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l9u1pq/something_peculiar_about_discussions_on_ethereum/,1,4

l9wyli,1612161693,ELI5: How will ERC20 tokens work across shards in Eth2?,"It is my understanding that the ETH1 chaindata state will be 'docked' as a shard in Eth2, lets call that Shard1.   However lets also imagine another shard, Shard2.   \n\nIt is clear that an ERC20 token that exists in ETH1 today will work in Shard1, no problem.  However, how will that token be able to be moved from Shard1 to Shard2, and how will Shard2 know how to 'handle' that token?  \n\nIn Shard2, will all ERC20 tokens operate the same way with the same interface and no custom code?  For example, will auto-rebalance token's balances like Ampleforth still re-balance in Shard2 even though the Ampleforth token contract only resides in Shard1?   \n\nIn my mind, that is an impossibility and tokens like Ampleforth will break after the ETH2 transition since users can simply transfer their tokens to another shard, like Shard2, where they will be immune from rebalancing down.    How am I correct or incorrect in that assumption?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l9wyli/eli5_how_will_erc20_tokens_work_across_shards_in/,6,2
