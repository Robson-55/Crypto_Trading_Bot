CryptoSwap Finance coming in May,"&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53dwsr24p1r61.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1979024ed4c0b8689f42a026a9899ac6e7bc075\n\n**CryptoSwap is Releasing Its White Paper**\n\n*Keep it here for the release of our Whitepaper, and get to know the master plan and how you can participate!*\n\nIn recent years, the use case for decentralized finance has grown. Crowdfunding has made it possible for investors to gain massively simplified access to the funds they need while also reaping the predicted gains. Profits have been made for both those concerned, including the staking group or investors and the pool website.\n\nFor many years, participants in the cryptocurrency room have been captivated by this food-based farming craze. We've seen many sites appear in the latest surge of Defi protocols that now enable users to stake their funds in exchange for the protocol's tokens.\n\nCryptoswap Finance is a decentralized exchange for exchanging BEP-20 tokens that run on Binance Smart Chain and has several other DeFi features that enable you to gain and win tokens. It's quick and inexpensive, and everybody can use it.\n\nThe potential of CryptoSwap, the ecosystem, and the features of the Binance Smart Chain are all pointing to greater success for everyone. The transaction speed is very quick and reliable, bringing the required performance, thanks to a flexible network and low transaction fees. Our framework and plan aim to gain universal acceptance and acknowledgment, culminating in the requisite transition and a new level of growth in the cryptocurrency room. \n\nLet’s join hands and create something beautiful!\n\nCryptoSwap Finance Website: [http://www.cryptoswap.finance](http://www.cryptoswap.finance/)\n\nWhitepaper: [http://www.cryptoswap.finance/whitepaper.pdf](http://www.cryptoswap.finance/whitepaper.pdf)\n\nCryptoSwap Finance on YT: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dMT1kramM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dMT1kramM)\n\nMain products: \n\n\- Crypto Trade/Exchange - The exchange platform is an automated market maker (AMM) that enables two tokens to be exchanged on the Binance Smart Chain. Tokens are exchanged immediately, cheap and secure.\n\n\- Crypto Farming - Farming platform let you deposit and lock LP tokens to earn reward in CSF tokens. This is simple way to earn even 20x reward with our main CSF/BNB pool.\n\n\- Crypto Staking - Staking platform allows Binance Smart Chain projects to bootstrap adoption though distributing some of their tokens to CSF holders. You can stake your CSF tokens to earn reward in other tokens.\n\n\- Crypto Lotteries\n\n\- Initial Farm Offerings\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ts003mn4p1r61.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ee4f30fc9754f2c5d7b1c84580979fed4a7bbfc\n\nContacts\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/csftoken](https://twitter.com/csftoken) \n\nTelegram channel: [https://t.me/cryptoswapfinancechannel](https://t.me/cryptoswapfinancechannel) \n\nTelegram group: [https://t.me/cryptoswapfinancegroup](https://t.me/cryptoswapfinancegroup) \n\nYoutube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwL6C01owsaIujDyHJTOwA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwL6C01owsaIujDyHJTOwA)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjka20/new_sleeping_defi_giant_cryptoswap_finance_coming/,1,5

mjlbx1,1617497113,Can I use the ethereum blockchain to organize a raffle for charity?,"Hi. My friends have been raffling objects they made and donating the pooled money to charity. The way it works is people send them USD using venmo or paypal and then whoever set up the raffle donates that money that is being pooled to a charity. The issue is that to donate you have to trust that they won't pocket the money. This trust system limits who are comfortable participating in the raffle, in a sense the raffle can't expand beyond a close network of known people. Would there be a way to set up a crypto wallet that people can send crypto to that can be audited by everyone? It would also be interesting if the wallet would automatically send the money to charity at a set date. In essence, a system that is programmed to pool the money, securely and transparently, and then send it to a charity without needing human input.\n\nThe potential resistance to using cryptocurrency for this is that I suspect most people participating in the raffles do not have much crypto experience. There are also transaction fees to consider as well as the issue of potentially having to convert the crypto to USD before donating it. It would be extra cool if the wallet can pick a raffle winner as well! If anybody has any ideas or suggestions I would appreciate it!\n\nI posted this question on r/cryptocurrencies and was told that this is basically a smart contract. Are there places where I can learn how to develop one?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjlbx1/can_i_use_the_ethereum_blockchain_to_organize_a/,1,8

mjp4kv,1617510971,What is Layer 2? Confused,"I've been hearing this terminology alot recently. Using a layer 2 solution sounds like its the magical solution to all problems. I'm just confused and have alot of questions about what this even means, if you could help clear any of these things up for me.  \n\n\n1. Why can you do a ""layer 2""? What does this mean? If something was built as a layer 2 on Ethereum, what are the restrictions for it? Why can't you do the same thing on Bitcoin? \n2. I've heard some people (newbies) say that they should just make a smart contract layer 2 on bitcoin since it's more secure, so that we don't need to use Ethereum. Is this actually possible? I know that bitcoin can't handle smart contracts because it's not turing complete, what about a layer 2 on bitcoin? **Do layer 2 solutions on bitcoin actually remove the purpose of Ethereum?**\n3. I noticed that alot of dapps are going to be using layer 2 solutions, to get past the issue with transaction fees currently on Ethereum. **Does this mean the existence of a dapp on layer 2 will not affect ethereum prices at all, and does not benefit ethereum?** For example, if a dapp were on Ethereum, then there would be a large inflow of ethereum buyers increasing the demand for Ethereum. But dapps on layer 2 don't need ethereum tokens, so the users of such an app would not be buying Ethereum tokens.\n4. For dapps that do run on Ethereum, after EIP1559 implements gas burning, wouldn't this mean that a ton of eth is going to be burned into nowhere from just dapp usage? This would raise the price of eth.\n\nThank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjp4kv/what_is_layer_2_confused/,1,80
