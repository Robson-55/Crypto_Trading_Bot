lmzsfj,1613688866,Ethereum/gold oz ratio new all time high Eth&gt;1oz gold,"Curious if anyone else celebrated Ethereum gold ratio new ATH.  Ethereum finally conquering 1 oz of gold per 1 Ethereum maybe leave the ratio in the dust same as bitcoin.  Last Ethereum run in 2018 gold was little over $1400 per oz.  Ethereum topped at 1.06 eth/oz of gold Jan 2013 2018 falling through 1-1 ratio.  Feb 12th 2021 is the next time we would close above 1-1 ratio closing at 1.01.  Further evidence shows eth/gold highest monthly candle body at .83 eth/oz of gold.  Feb 07 last decent eth correction held exactly on .83 eth/gold ratio. Ath weekly body @ 1.01 eth/gold will most likely become support this week.  This time Ethereum breaking through ATH with power we may never return to such an attractive ratio for gold holders.  \n\nBitcoin first day to close over 1-1 ratio per oz of gold was March 02, 2017z. We all know what came next...  was the real top for Ethereum $1400 or was it the Ethereum/gold oz all time high set Ethereum parabolic similar to bitcoin.  These ratios can be viewed in TradingView and I can provide my TA on it for those interested.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lmzsfj/ethereumgold_oz_ratio_new_all_time_high_eth1oz/,1,0
