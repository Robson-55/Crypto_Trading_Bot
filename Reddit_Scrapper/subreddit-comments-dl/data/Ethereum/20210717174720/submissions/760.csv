nvfxnc,1623189958,Just buy and hold ETH vs. using Aave vs. Uniswap vs. Alchemix,"Am I the only one who doesn't get the appeal of all of these financial crypto stuff? \n\nI really don't understand why anyone wouldn't just keep investing in ETH and hold, vs. transferring ETH and converting them to tokens on Alchemix or Uniswap or Aave and start doing staking/pooling to earn a relatively tiny amount of interest rate in exchange face a lot more risks of losing their ETH. \n\nIn the case of Uniswap - if you are pooling you are trading 50% of ETH toward another coin that in the long-run is not going to be as valuable as ETH, so you are losing money due to price divergence in exchange for getting fees, but those fees are gonna be small in the long run compared to just holding 100% of ETH and see it appreciate. \n\nIn the case of Aave, you are giving up ETH in exchange for Aave's aToken, while theoretically this aToken gives you interest rate, the value of aToken could grow slower than ETH in the long-run or have something else happen to it (point is, it is NOT ETH), which still means you are losing out when compared to just straight up holding ETH. Plus, interest rate is pretty low nowadays for depositing ETH on aave anyways, trying any other crypto is too risky, and there are still unknown risks and costs of just moving money around on Aave. \n\nIn the case of Alchemix - again, it's great that you get some upfront money, but then you have to pay it back over time plus pay interests. And you are asked to pay more than you get in the beginning so in the long run, you still lose money. Alchemix is basically a loan shark. People love getting money upfront, but at what cost?  \n\nI'm not looking to make $100. I am looking to 10x my investment. And I think the best way to do this is to just buy ETH and HOLD. All of these fancy financial instruments are full of traps, and act more like a bank for the poor or a casino or lottery machine for those who are addicted to gambling. In the end, the house always wins. \n\nI think maybe if you work at a $B hedge fund trading crypto, you can build an algorithm to take advantage of loop holes, but ordinary people should just stick with buy and hold.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nvfxnc/just_buy_and_hold_eth_vs_using_aave_vs_uniswap_vs/,1,3

nvg6z5,1623190623,Government Regulation of General Purpose Blockchains through Smart Contract Auditing,"Thinking about blockchains and risk of harms related to them, I wonder if for blockchain solutions to fully mature, they will have to play nice with some the same existing power structures they are supposed to supplant, to some degree.  If blockchains are suspected of facilitating terrorism, human trafficking, or other societal harms, enough momentum may gather to scare voters (and in turn governments) into limiting the technology.\n\nHowever, I feel that in some ways blockchains, at least general purpose ones, are well suited for regulation.  If you know the input(s) into a smart contract, you for sure know its output.  And smart contracts are open source and readable.  As such, authorities could ""limit"" (not sure how) transactions to certified or audited smart contracts.  They cannot control or prevent a transaction, nor do they even need to know the specifics of the transaction, they just need to know it happened through a smart contract that isn't contributing to illegal activity.\n\nThat said I'm still pretty new to this all so I could be missing something...",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nvg6z5/government_regulation_of_general_purpose/,1,4

Before anyone asks or doubts... no I am not willing to screenshot my holding, I do not need to prove anything to anyone. What I will say is I have done plenty of research on crypto in the past few years and the momentum it has gained is no longer discountable. I chose ETH in particular due to sheer numbers and the fact that it is way more efficient than Bitcoin. To put it terms most will understand... BTC is Blackberry at its height and ETH is Apple slowly getting ready to dominate market share. I am not a multi-millionaire by any means but this investment for me is long term (3-7 years) and I am prepared to lost it if I am wrong about ETH. It will hurt, but no on got set for life by playing it safe. With all that said... I am on the train that will hopefully get upgraded to a rocket ...

That would be exponentially harder, no?\n\nThis is what I’ve never understood about ETH keys. I get that its essentially impossible to guess a private key.. but why not take it a step further by requiring the equivalent of a specific username first (in the ETH use case this would be the public key) and then the password/recovery code (the private key in the ETH use case)?\n\nDoes this make sense?
