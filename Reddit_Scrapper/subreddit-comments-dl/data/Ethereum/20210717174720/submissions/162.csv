Are y‚Äôall buying at $350ish and selling at $380ish like me? Or are you expecting Ethereum to boom within a year to above $1000?\n\nI‚Äôm very ignorant and you won‚Äôt offend me by telling me how wrong I am. I know none of us are fortune tellers who can read the future, just want some discussion on a topic I could really be educated on.\n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/j23ev8/buysell_suggestions/,1,2
