ku7zn3,1610255232,Question on POS staking pools,"So I'm obviously, no expert here. But I've recently started reading on POW and POS and I just thought of a simple question here.\n\nWith POS implemented, obviously, with the current (and growing) market cap fo Ethereum, it's probably going to be hard to buy enough eth to stake 51% (the price of Eth would probably also skyrocket at this point).\n\nHowever, with the number of mining pools emerging (which because the price of Eth is likely to increase over time and you need to stake 32 entire Eth coins to validate, it's very likely that most people will have to use mining pools to stake), wouldn't it become an issue?\n\nEven right now, isn't most of the mining power controlled by mining pools?\n\nLike in theory, if let's say some hackers or some powerful people (let's just assume there is a way) gets their hands on just a few of the largest staking pools and just happens to obtain more than 51% of the Eth staked, or maybe just control of the validator of these mining pools, wouldn't they be able to make an attack?\n\nOr perhaps I'm just missing something here? Probably more likely to be that but I'm just trying to understand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ku7zn3/question_on_pos_staking_pools/,1,10

It seems other coins haven't come as far as ethereum in this regard but that is just my notion, nothing I know for sure. Does anyone know if Ethereum is actually ahead in this regard?\n\nBitcoin has found its niche as a store of value but is rather useless as digital money because of poor transaction rates. It seems Bitcoin hasnt made much progress regarding transaction rate at all and the community is extremely conservative with experimenting. Is this statement also true? Or am I biased.\n\nIt seems to me that if cryptocurrencies are really going to take off some time then transaction rates have to come up by orders of magnitude.

kudxkj,1610283065,Inability for long-term planning when using ETH as a business owner,"I am slowly digging into ETH and ETH2.0. My question is as follows: \n\n1. Alice owns an online gallery of images. Other users can pay $0.001ETH (currently $1.2) and obtain the use rights to the images. \n2. The network fees are $0 and we use ETH2.0 (this is an asumption to simplify the calcs).\n3. Alice accumuluates the proceeds at her ETH wallet. \n4. Bob is a contractor who creates images for Alice. The pay is 50% of the selling price, i.e. $0.5.\n5. Alice pays Bob on the first day of the month following the month during which his photos were bought. \n6. Now, let's imagine the following scenario: \n\na. that Alice sold 100 images (100 images \* 0.001ETH \* $1.2 = $120). \n\nb. Then, ETH nosedives 30% which results in Alice having only $80. \n\nc. She pays $60 to Bob, while she retains only $20 in profits, as opposed to the expected profit of   \n$60. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am just starting to learn how ETH works and how ETH2.0 will operate. In particular, I am very interested in staking and I am considering creating the blog about staking. However, the expectations of the high fluctuations in the asset being used for transactions makes me feel that businesses will be extremely fret to adopt. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is the use of DAI a solution to this use case?
