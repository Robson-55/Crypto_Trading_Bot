lqaczm,1614058275,Why was an economic solution chosen to solve the halting problem for smart contracts?,"As the title states I'm curious why an economic based solution in the form of network fees per transaction was chosen to handle the halting problem that comes with running any arbitrary and untrusted code. From what I understand it looks like any fee based blockchain, not just ethereum or the evm, would have this same problem given enough traffic. Is there a reason for choosing the fee based model over another option that I'm missing?\n\nAs far as I understand the reason that the ethereum network has the concept of gas and gas fees is to handle the halting problem for smart contracts. What I haven't been able to find is an in-depth explanation as to why an economic based solution was chosen over another one? \n\nFor those who aren't familiar with the halting problem here's the TLDR from wikipeida:\n\n&gt; In [computability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory_(computer_science)), the **halting problem** is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) and an input, whether the program will finish running, or continue to run forever. \n\nI get that it's important to address the issue of the halting problem when crating a platform that lets anyone run any arbitrary, untrusted, code on it in the form of smart contracts. Without some way to address the halting problem it would be trivial to bring the network down by running smart contracts that just infinitely loop. With that said it seems less than ideal to choose an economic based solution (gas fees) as the answer to this rather than something like having a hard limit on program execution time in the EVM. \n\nI'm pretty new to ethereum  and very new to digging into the technical side of ethereum so please feel free to correct any mistaken assumptions that I might have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lqaczm/why_was_an_economic_solution_chosen_to_solve_the/,3,12
