lto6sn,1614432707,Ethereum Web 3.0 Concerns,"Still relatively new to the world of ethereum and have a few concerns about centralization, probably totally misguided, but please hear me out and let me know your thoughts. So let’s say in the far future the “web 3.0” is actually built on the ethereum network, wouldn’t that give the developers of ethereum way too much centralized power? I hear about all these new protocols they are working on and always wonder how these new protocols are implemented exactly, and who decides weather or not they are fair. Sure, people can transfer to other networks for now, but what happens when ethereum is so we’ll established that people no longer have the option to change networks. \n\nThere are a few current protocol changes that could increase centralization. One is proof of stake, right now it is set at 32 eth, but whose to say that number couldn’t be jacked up to a absurdly high price far into the future, leaving only a few massive players controlling the network. \n\nTl;dr Guess my main concern is the world becomes so dependent on the ethereum network that the programmers with access to the main code can make essentially any protocol changes they want and there’s nothing we can do to stop it.

ltpx8j,1614438243,We need a blockchain version of onlyfans on ETH.,"Onlyfans has created a boom in sex work by monetizing the porn industry via commoditizing each star through the way of the free market. I'm sure you know someone in real life who has dipped their toes in  creating porn recently because of this platform. One could argue whether or not this is good for society, but it certainly has been good for the pockets of these young emerging pornstars and created an entirely new market. When new markets emerge, new opportunities for blockchain to get a first mover advantage on this new market. I think the next step for NFTs would be to create some sort of competitor to Onlyfans.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ltpx8j/we_need_a_blockchain_version_of_onlyfans_on_eth/,40,72

ltror5,1614443537,TL;DR On EIP-1559,"I've been seeing constant crazy misrepresentation of the arguments against the proposal so I decided to write a ultra TL;DR on what it actually boils down to.\n\nMiners are NOT against smaller gas prices and they are NOT against predictability. What they are actually against is the burning the fees instead of paying them to the miners, that is the actual debate. Burn vs pay the miners, in no way this impacts the gas prices. \n\nHere are the choices:\n\n1. Favor the miners, everything in the proposal can go except the burning the fees. Pay them for doing the job, they are getting screwed when 2.0 comes out anyway.\n2. Favor the people staking for ETH 2.0. Many are not seeing the ones that will benefit the most from burning the fees, it's not ""miners vs community"", it's miners vs stakers. ETH being inflationary diminishes their returns, this proposal makes ETH deflationary, which is great for them.\n\nStakers are the future of ETH, since the devs are of course pro 2.0, the devs are siding with them in detriment of the miners. My opinion: why fire the goalkeeper 5min before the end of the game, very little to gain for jeopardizing ethereum security.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ltror5/tldr_on_eip1559/,0,9
