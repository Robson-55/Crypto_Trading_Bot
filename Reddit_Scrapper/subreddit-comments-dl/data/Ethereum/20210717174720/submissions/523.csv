mrqe39,1618527872,NOOB REQUESTS ADVICE,"Hello! Noob here... I‚Äôm reading as much as I can but it‚Äôs all moving so fast! Ok so here‚Äôs the gist:\nA few weeks ago I put $700 into ETH when it was around $1600on. It turned into $900 pretty quickly - a friend advised me to see at around $2100 and buy again when it dipped back down to $1600. Obviously that has not happened and I want to slap myself for listening to him too soon as I could have made a few more $100s at this point. My question is: When should I buy again? My instinct tells me if it dips to 2k I should move. \nSecond question is - What else to buy? I have a few thousand to invest in crypto and would like to just sit on for a while. \nAny advise for a little noob who begged her parents to buy bitcoin when it was $4 and they didn‚Äôt listen to her, would be much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mrqe39/noob_requests_advice/,1,16

mrs1vk,1618533627,"Berlin gave us some DoS resistance, time to raise the gas limit","So Berlin fixes a bunch of DoS vectors, and the network is busy and full of great stuff. There's loads of new interest in Ethereum, it's a real shame to turn away people without a preexisting ETH stash. Everyone is working  hard getting projects working on L2 systems but the best stuff isn't yet done, and in any case we still need move things to those systems, and that takes L1 gas.\n\nState will grow but SSDs are cheap and easier than ever to add; PCs nowadays usually have either an M2 SSD slot or a PCIE slot that you can turn into an M2 slot with an adaptor, just pop it in there like a stick of RAM and boom, you have 1TB of fast storage for barely over $100, or 0.034 ETH in our money. Initial sync time isn't a complete non-issue but you only do it once, and sync methods are getting better all the time.\n\nI'm not saying we should go mad or anything but a moderate increase would be great.
