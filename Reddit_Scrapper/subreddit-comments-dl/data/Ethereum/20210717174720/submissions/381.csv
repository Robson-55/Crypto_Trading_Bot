lj2ugb,1613231109,Best place to buy ETH? Best option for storing it? (I know this has been asked a lot sorry),"Getting back in the crypto game, and going heavy on ETH. I know these questions are asked all the time but the answers change frequently and I can't seem to find a good recent post about it, so:\n\n* Where is the best place to buy Ethereum? I will probably start with Coinbase, but I'm wondering what the latest potential options for ""decentralized"" purchasing are? And let's say I was to buy a large sum at once, is there somewhere that might have lower fees than Coinbase? And/or is there somewhere I can buy it that isn't going to sell/provide my PII to the government or other regulatory authorities?\n* Assuming I do use Coinbase, what's the best storage method for when I decide to pull my coins off the exchange? Probably going to get a hardware wallet. I had stored a small amount on Metamask before but I'm reading really mixed things about that now.\n\nThank you all for your patience :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lj2ugb/best_place_to_buy_eth_best_option_for_storing_it/,1,10

lj39ze,1613232439,Mad about Gas Fees?,"Full disclosure, I own ETH, BTC, XMR and about 2 dozen other coins.  Until recently, I had most of my portfolio in ETH and BTC; however, after reading a ton of negative posts about gas fees, and the switch from proof of work to proof of stake in this sub and countless others, I did some more research on the topic. \n\nDuring that research, I stumbled upon a really good video called Sound Money Safe Mode. For anyone not familiar with it, I highly recommend you check out the slides on Scarcity (26:06) and Unwanted Scarcity (34:36). These slides cover asymptotic zero annualized inflation and silicon economies of scale. In short, they show the major shortfalls in design for ETH and BTC as compared to XMR.\n\nNow, before you all downvote me and say I‚Äôm just here to push another coin, please read my opening statement again. As an investor, I believe in diversification, and I hope you‚Äôll check this out and keep an open mind.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC9Uu5BUxII",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lj39ze/mad_about_gas_fees/,1,32
