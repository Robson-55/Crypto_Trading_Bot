kzekhj,1610916276,ETH lost by selecting an incorrect gas fee?,"Hey guys. Semi crypto newbie here. I transferred ETH from my Binance account to my ETH wallet a few days ago. I don't recall which transfer network I used, but the funds haven't showed up in my ETH wallet yet.\n\nHowever I have received an email from Binance saying the transfer was successful and there does seem to be 3000+ confirmations on the transaction when viewing on the blockchain.\n\nWhat could be the reason for this? And is there a chance of getting these coins back somehow? \n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kzekhj/eth_lost_by_selecting_an_incorrect_gas_fee/,1,39
kzfnev,1610919505,Very dissapointed Newb on high transaction fees,"I'm new to the ether ecosystem and have already lost   $40 usd in transaction fees. I was introduced with the coinbase earn program for ""Maker"" and used the coinbase wallet to handle these transaction. I use other networks and don't pay attention to transaction fees as that is usually the most trivial part of the experience. So to my horror when I took a second look after trying to convert from Ether to some singularitynet tokens. So the high transaction fee which drove me to check my past transactions. This is not sustainable and feel scammed by this network.

Will it get lower? Or seeing as I only just decided to look by chance tonight should I just keep it there and see what happens over the next few years? \n\nKind of stopped keeping up with the crypto currency world around 2018! \n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kzhrwi/some_advice_should_i_sell/,1,3

kzjp3j,1610932390,Ethereum Classic is extremely undervalued right now- right?,"I can’t help but feel, in the current crypto climate, that Eth Classic is almost definitely undervalued right now. I don’t see in any way how it could possibly stay valued at &lt;$8, right? I mean I’m a noob but like- it’s compatible with ETH, and ETH is the runner-up crypto. It follows the same trend as ETH, except it’s value is extremely muted this year compared to the last crypto boom. Follows the same trend as Bitcoin Gold but Bitcoin Gold is worth almost $500, and it’s gone down 13% over the last 5 years whereas Eth Classic has gone up almost 1000%. Still at $8 though. I think it’s bound increase in value, because i think it is so obviously undervalued right now.

kzlno0,1610939047,Recovery from Samsung Blockchain Keystore,"Thanks for your time in reading this -- I am really at wits end, getting no support from Samsung on this issue at all.\n\nI created a wallet with MEW on my Samsung device. Inside, I hold ETH and an ERC-20 coin. MEW seems to have integrated with the Samsung Blockchain Keystore, so any transactions out of the wallet need to be verified with a PIN. I no longer have this PIN and there seems to be no way to reset it. Further, there is no way to reset/delete the Samsung Blockchain Keystore without the PIN.\n\nI do have the 12 word mnemonic passphrase. On a different device, I see I can access an existing wallet with MEW using the mnemonic phrase, however I don't understand the implications of this. Will this move everything off my device and the wallet it holds and into the new wallet, or just allow me to look inside?\n\nObviously, my biggest fear is losing the coins inside the existing wallet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kzlno0/recovery_from_samsung_blockchain_keystore/,1,3

kzmkgx,1610942255,Absolute noob question,"When I look at today's chart for Ethereum, at 2:00am the price was \~$1570 when only an hour later it rose to \~$1620. So if bought one Ethereum at 2am and sold it the hour later, does that mean I would have made a quick $50? And similarly, if I bought thousands of dollars worth of ETH and sold it once the price rises shortly after I feel like I would obviously make a quick profit. \n\nHowever, I never find any guides explaining something to similar this or even suggesting to do this. 'Day trading' seems like something completely different to what I explained unless I'm just missing something (or I'm an idiot).\n\nSo is this something that people do lol.
