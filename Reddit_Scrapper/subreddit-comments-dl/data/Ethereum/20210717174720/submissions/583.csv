n2bdso,1619844241,whats the best ethereum block explorer for accuracy. etherscan isnt that accurate for older data,"im in the process of doing taxes, got pinged for years 2018, 2019, 2020. but the ATO (australian tax office)\n\nfor years 2018/2019 the transactions tab often doesnt go back far enough for my wallet; the internal transaction tab where ive withdrawn from a dex has missing transactions tho the transaction has will exist on ether scan it just doesnt show up in my wallet transactions for some reason. same issue with the erc20 token transactions.\n\nIve had a look at a couple of other block explorers:\n\nhttps://etherchain.org/ - seems more accurate though it doesnt have utc time just the block number.\n\nhttps://ethplorer.io/ - this one is nice in that it allows quick tagging of addresses for notes. and seems to be able to tag less comon exchanges like idex better than etherscan.\n\nthat said, i do like how etherscan puts the transactions, internal and erc20 tokens in different tabs.\n\njust curious if there is something more accurate / better features then what ive mentioned. big plus if there are block explorers that can identify older exchange wallets like cryptopia (got hacked and taken down, so i have no idea what money i put in and withdrawaled from there)\n\nand fyi, this is why you log your trades. im currently using https://koinly.io to do my tax which is doing a good job so far, but it cant track everything e.g. idex withdrawals and deposits.

n2bvl2,1619846320,Ethereum's Biggest Pro is Also One of It's Biggest Cons,"Prior to having watched hours of Youtube videos and reading dozens of articles, I had no idea what Ethereum was. I was fully invested in Bitcoin, however, after taking an immense amount of time to educate myself on Ethereum, I noticed what an amazing creation it is. \n\nThis brings me to my point, the biggest pro about Ethereum is that it creates a great solution to an enormous problem with complex solutions including many different vocabularies like DAOs, Dapps,  Defi, etc. That being said, the problem with such a complex system and technology is that it is a huge turnoff to people trying to start to understand it. I had to dedicate hours of my time and I still only understand a fraction of what Ethereum is. \n\n[Ethereum.org](https://Ethereum.org) does provide some teachings however I find it difficult to understand as a student with no programming background. \n\nThe point of this post is I really hope they begin to put more effort towards teaching the general public about what Ethereum is really about, instead of being just another altcoin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n2bvl2/ethereums_biggest_pro_is_also_one_of_its_biggest/,1,322
