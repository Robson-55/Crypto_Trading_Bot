o1d7iu,1623871742,Added layer to mass adoption,"Just a thought. \n\nTo aid in mass adoption of crypto in general, when doing odd jobs or anything where you‚Äôd ordinarily transact in cash under 100 dollars, let‚Äôs force whoever is paying to pay us in crypto, whichever it may be. \n\nSay a buddy asks for a ride and is willing to pay 10-20 dollars. Instead of accepting cash, agree to the deal only if they pay in crypto. \n\nIf they don‚Äôt know how, kindly assist them with setting up an account and allowing you to watch every step of the way, as well as confirming the numbers with them before you send to your wallet from theirs. \n\n1. Don‚Äôt be a scumbag and send yourself 100 bucks in crypto while telling them it‚Äôs only 10 or 20 or whatever. \n2. Show them how the fees work as well. If you agreed to say 25 dollar payment, use enough out of the 25 to cover the gas fees for them the first time, while explaining how they work and letting them know they‚Äôll have to pay them per transaction. \n\n\nIf you‚Äôre a kid in crypto, you‚Äôre probably more tech savvy than most adults. You can probably figure out how to download the necessary things to hold crypto. \n\n1. Pay each other in crypto for small amounts of cash. Say under 10 bucks if you‚Äôre a kid. Since you will need that cash in the short term just use small amounts. \n2. Tell your parents to give you gift money in the form of crypto. Forces them to use the technology and",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o1d7iu/added_layer_to_mass_adoption/,1,26

o1eyma,1623876164,I have a simple question,"Ethereum -&gt; Ethereum 2.\n\nWe are all awaiting this with great anticipation. I hope it goes well, but a question in the back of my mind keeps bothering me.\n\nWhy should developers wait potentially years for Ethereum 2 to fully arrive, when more and more newer (and perhaps more technically capable) blockchains are either introducing or already have their own Ethereum Virtual Machines?\n\nDevelopers can wait forever on Vitalik to fulfill his promises, or they can deploy their smart contract on a network that offers similar, same or even better (no transaction fees, high throughput etc) .... today. Even if the developers would rather stay on Ethereum, I imagine some Tech Lead or CEO type could easily force entire teams to make the switch. Shit, the developers might even end up liking whichever new blockchain they end up on and that'll be that.\n\nWhere do you see this going?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o1eyma/i_have_a_simple_question/,0,3
