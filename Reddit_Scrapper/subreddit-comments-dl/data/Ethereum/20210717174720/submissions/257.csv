kgou72,1608444070,BUCC - privacy token on Ethereum allowing transactions which not showing on etherscan,"Buccaneer V2 (BUCC) is a working privacy token on Ethereum. Thereâ€™s rudimentary proof on the etherscan, https://etherscan.io/token/0xd5a7d515fb8b3337acb9b053743e0bc18f50c855 \n\n&gt; *Etherscan don't show Holders and Transactions, as they don't exists but, in fact, they're existing and, moreover, confirmed by Ethereum decentralized consensus.*\n\nBut thatâ€™s just sort of a band aid that they figured out how to hide balances. The real privacy comes through the **Bermuda API**, when you send a transaction (https://buccapi.eth), make sure you have metamask or some other web3 friendly wallet format available for it.\n\nFor now, BUCC is the number one privacy solution and its market cap is around only 200k right now, barely marketed and barely heard about.\n\nIt gets sweeter though, a lot of lovely folks like to claim you can track TXs through an Ethereum node by scooping up all interacted with addresses, but with the private wallet and GSN, you can self-whitelist through the private wallet. **Right now, sending a transaction through BUCCâ€™s api is 100% private and itâ€™s API is serverless and literally BUCC, it is a smart contract.**\n\nTumbler/farm code situated here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x0ffaa8eeb2ee18c9174e4c5d6af6ce48199c6879#code\n\nTo learn more about BUCC, visit r/BuccaneerV2",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kgou72/bucc_privacy_token_on_ethereum_allowing/,1,2

kgtzmh,1608470922,Need a feedback for a new Dapp,"Hello community,\n\nWe made a [Dapp](https://kool.lol/) dedicated to the Kool-Aid drink. The idea behind is the ability to collect a variety of flavors and mix cocktails from them. The ERC-1155 smart-contract is responsible for this. We'd like to hear you feedback and invite you to our smooth community. \n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe Kool Bar is powered by 2 tokens: KOOL and AID. KOOL is the main token with the fixed supply tradable on [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xda15087ec9a8460e2e52504d0757a154a158b913). AID is a supplementary inflationary token which [can be farmed](https://kool.lol/farm/) by staking KOOL and KOOL/ETH LP tokens.\n\n[The Kool Bar](https://kool.lol/bar) includes NFT flavors of different rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Super Rare. Flavors are seasonal, however some may reappear as mixing ingredients in the future seasons.\n\nCommon flavors are being sold for AID. Uncommon, Rare and Super Rare can only be obtained via mixing. Common flavors are the very foundation of the Kool Bar as no cocktails can be mixed without them. Youâ€™d better possess several NFTs of each common flavor, if you want to complete the whole season collection. Each time you mix a new cocktail its ingredientsâ€™ NFTz get burnt and therefore become scarcer. In some scenarios certain Common flavors may become even scarcer than Rare ones!\n\nThat's it! Anyway, check out the website and claim Zero flavor NFT for free (only gas to spend).",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kgtzmh/need_a_feedback_for_a_new_dapp/,1,3
