loyjg5,1613919021,what am i buying by exchanging Ethereum?,"hey guys, I keep having this question, that i can not respond. What am i getting when i buy 1 Ethereum?\n\nThe ""smart contracts"" tecnology is amazing. the company ideas are amazing.\n\nBut i can't understand why would ""Ethereum"" go up or down in price, besides people joining in and buying higher\n\nBitcoin i can understand, it's finite, it's ""gold"", allows for big moves and tax evasion. Currencyes that are coins and limited, i can understand.\n\nBuying stocks, that go up and down from speculation and company profits, i can understand.\n\nCurrencies that are tokens that you burn, i cannot understand.\n\nIf i'm getting this correct, when i buy ethereum i'm really just buying a token, called Ether, that is unlimited and is used as a ticket, to make transactions. right?\n\nRight now i have $1k in ethereum, for me it's almost gamble since i can't understand where the money comes from to make it go higher, or why would anyone buy it higher besides FOMO. I put it there because of the fundamentals, just like a stock. But i don't think i'm investing in the company Ethereum. I don't think i'm investing at all, i think i'm just buying a coin, that will be used to buy other stuff.  \n\n\nCan anyone help me clear my mind?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/loyjg5/what_am_i_buying_by_exchanging_ethereum/,1,21

lp1j03,1613927427,"Is ZKSwap really a rollup? Some concerns... TVL &gt; 170,000,000 USD","(See links below) As far as I can tell based on reviewing the whitepaper and whatever information I can come by, only a ""summary"" of L2 transactions such as swaps are put on L1 in an effort to maximize scalability. From [https://medium.com/zkswap/zkswap-introduces-practical-zk-rollups-zkspeed-achieving-high-tps-and-low-gas-fees-in-real-6effe4e789e0](https://medium.com/zkswap/zkswap-introduces-practical-zk-rollups-zkspeed-achieving-high-tps-and-low-gas-fees-in-real-6effe4e789e0)\n\n&gt;Second, for transactions only related to layer2, ZKSpeed adopts a distributed storage solution, revealing the original transaction data in real-time, and puts the data summary on-chain in real-time. The data summary will be released by the layer2 operator itself, but anyone can verify the summary's accuracy in real-time. In the long run, the computation and release of the data summary can be carried out in a distributed manner after introducing community verification. By ‚Äãcategorizing‚Äã off-chain data, ZKSpeed greatly improves the scalability of data.\n\nOn their Discord, I asked explicitly whether all information **needed to recreate** the state can be found on L1 and is verified by their L1 smart contract, to which I didn't get an affirmative answer. With lack of all the necessary information directly on L1, this really should not claim to be a rollup. It is more of a Validium.  **Being a Validium is acceptable for certain security/scalability** needs but to claim it is a rollup and it not be is genuinely concerning if not an outright misrepresentation. Validium solutions naturally improve scalability at the cost of introducing new attack vectors.\n\nNot only that, but there is no mention of the L2 architecture that maximizes ""data availability"" since only a summary exists on L1. Based on the whitepaper, it seems that the ZK provers can be distributed but it appears to be a server-client model and doesn't address data availability and isn't currently live anyways. Most projects that I've seen in this space elaborate on worst-case scenarios such as if a centralized L2 actor updates the state while withholding data, but these kinds of scenarios and mitigations/solutions are unseen in their documentation. As far as I can tell, **at any moment**, **right now**, the ZKSwap ""Server"" can 1) update the state with a valid state transition and send a corresponding proof to L1 and 2) withhold necessary data from everyone thus taking everyone's funds hostage. Now this is not to say that whoever is running that Server currently is malicious but rather it is a clear centralized point of vulnerability if ""promises"" to provide data availability are not kept.\n\nI hope I am wrong since seeing a total-value-locked exceeding 170,000,000 USD is disconcerting. Please prove me wrong.\n\nI am referring to this: [https://zks.org/en](https://zks.org/en) \n\nWhitepaper [https://github.com/l2labs/zkswap-whitepaper/raw/master/zkswap\_en.pdf](https://github.com/l2labs/zkswap-whitepaper/raw/master/zkswap_en.pdf)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lp1j03/is_zkswap_really_a_rollup_some_concerns_tvl/,1,27
