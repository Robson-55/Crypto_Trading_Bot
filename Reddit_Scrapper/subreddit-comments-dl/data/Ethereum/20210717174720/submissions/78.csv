If I'm a person who doesn't know or care about crypto or privacy or decentralization, why would I figure out how to use Ethereum based apps and not just open the Google Play or App Store? \n\nIs it just a matter of privacy or is there any other actual benefit to using Ethereum based apps? \n\nI just don't see Ethereum exploding based on some virtual games where you can use Ethereum to buy a virtual sneaker.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hvixnp/what_is_the_point_of_decentralized_applications/,3,3
