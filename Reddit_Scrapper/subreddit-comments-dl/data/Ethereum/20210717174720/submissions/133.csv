il34uj,1599036138,What to look for when reviewing a new coin/contract/project ect before putting money in.,"Hi,\n\nBasic question, but I think a lot of people don't really consider/critically think about a project before putting their money in. Especially now with the whole yield farming bubble we're in...any time you see .finance, they through money in.\n\nWith me I look for the amount of coins in circulation/ generated. Whether they are bomb token ect. I look to see if there any any one wallet with a huge % of coins in, as to try and avoid a pump and dump (but its more difficult now due to pools), check to see if the contract has reviews/been audited.\n\nWhat are some thing you look for before putting money in?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/il34uj/what_to_look_for_when_reviewing_a_new/,1,1

Not linking the v1  since I don't want to get flagged as self-promoting (it's on Steam) but it currently  includes three different ""worlds,"" one of which is Ethereum.\n\nThe  current version (seen above) queries the Etherscan + Ethplorer +  Blockcypher APIs &amp; allows the user to ""inspect"" a confirmed block.  The large white section represents the vol. of all the ETH  (sending/trading) confirmed in the block; the other, colored layers  represent the vol. of token transactions (in eth) confirmed in the  block. When the user hovers over a layer they can learn about each token  &amp; the respective project.\n\nIt  has trickle of purchases &amp; an inactive/decent IG (5k followers), but  I'm really interested in cranking up the immersiveness on the 2.0 &amp;  establishing it as the \*the\* VR blockexplorer. I feel comfortable  doubling-down on the Unity/VR frontend &amp; marketing but I'm honestly  aggressively mediocre at the backend of the stack.\n\nWhether  it's opening sockets from a 3rd-party service or from a node we're  self-hosting, I'd love to partner up with someone. The Eth world has the most functionality &amp; imo offers the  most educational value so I thought I'd post here first.\n\nWon't  waste your time, primarily looking for a part-time partner interested  in rev sharing; however, I'm open to hourly contracting too just won't  be near market rates.\n\nHappy to answer any additional questions &amp; mods I apologize if this breaks any rules. Already posted in /ethdev but unfortunately didn't get much traction.\n\nCheers",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ila7fs/improving_educational_tool_vr_blockexplorer/,1,0
