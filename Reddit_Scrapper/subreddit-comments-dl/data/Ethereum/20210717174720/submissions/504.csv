I think the total amount could be worth $5000 today.\n\nShe doesn't have access to the computer and her ex is a total CHODE.(wouldnt give her turtle back).\n\nShe's worried if she contacts him and gives him her pw to get in, that he is going to just ADIOS and ghost her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mlbas4/tricky_situation_could_use_some_advice/,1,31

mlglbq,1617729105,Mining Issue,"Hi guys,\n\nI have an issue I can't seem to figure out.\n\nI have a Windows 10 rig with 5 Radeon RX 480.\n\nI use Phoenix to mine.\n\nThe issue I have is the following and it started about a month ago:\n\nI install the Crimson Relive driver, MSI Afterburner and then atimdag-patcher.\n\nAfter multiple restarts to complete all these installs I launch the Phoenix bat file and everything goes well... for 1 to 3 days.\n\nThen 1 morning, while doing my usual check up, I realize the mining stopped and phoenix quit (Windows updates are disabled and all the windows settings are set up to leave it on all the time).\n\nWhen I check atikmdag, it basically reset telling me ""found"" instead of ""already patched"".\n\nSo I patch again, restart the computer, and the miner now tells me 1 of the gpu has the setclkernel issue. The gpu with the issue is never the same. It can be gpu1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.\n\nSo I edit the bat file to put ""-clkernel 0"", save it and start the miner again and it works fine, except I now lost 100Mh/s. All my GPUs are performing at less than a 3rd of their capacity.\n\nSo I use DDU, to uninstall the driver, Reinstall everything, it doesn't work, I repeat the DDU process sometimes once, sometimes up to 3 times and then it works again at full speed... for another 1 to 3 days....\n\nRinse and repeat.\n\nAny solution?\n\nTIA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mlglbq/mining_issue/,1,5
