nj1w91,1621751853,Building the next compound. Looking for feedback,"Hi there! I'm a solidty dev. I'm currently looking to build the next [compound.finance](https://compound.finance) but for assets that currently aren't supported as much yet but have strong communities like terra/luna or sushi. Looking for some feedback on my approach!\n\nFirst, I'm thinking of building on top of some of the layer 2's out there like polygon to take advantage of the lower fees\n\nSecond, I'm thinking of starting with a stablecoin pool to bootstrap the stablecoin side and while its not yet ready for lending out, I could always send some of the pool over to places like [curve.fi](https://curve.fi) or sushiswap so that the user's funds could earn an interest and have some use (sort of like yearn) while I build out the non-stablecoin/borrowing side \n\nWhat do you guys think of something like this? i'm trying out to break it down into an mvp so I can build this and get something out\n\nAlso if there's any people here who knows solidity and is down to hacking on a defi apps together, would love to chat, would love to code together with a partner on this idea or perhaps some ideas you have",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nj1w91/building_the_next_compound_looking_for_feedback/,1,2

nj2d9c,1621753986,New investor,Anyone else very new and had big losses? I've bought a fair amount of ethereum at $3888 and have obviously had a quite large loss.

nj4h89,1621763218,Crash,Yo. So theres a prediction that seems to be true so far. About the crash of the crypto market. Then a rapid increase. So ethereum was at 4k a week or so ago. Now its at 2k. Would it be worth it to chuck a few pennies in there once it goes below 2k in hopes of it following bitcoin and shooting back up to 4 or at least 3k??
