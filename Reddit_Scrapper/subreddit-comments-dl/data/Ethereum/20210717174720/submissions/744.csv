nrf54n,1622731374,Any work in Ethereum for Accountants?,"Hello. I discovered Ethereum earlier this year and the more I read about the underlying technology and the ecosystem that is being created through it, the more convinced I am of the impact it's going to have on money and the way we use the Internet. I can't afford much Ether right now, so I've been looking into doing some work in the community to get some ETH (or other tokens within the EVM), as well as do my part in contributing to this amazing innovation. \n\nI am an Accountant (becoming a CPA), and I was wondering if there were any jobs or functions within the Ethereum community or any DAOs that would benefit from someone with that type of skill. This way I can use what I know to provide some type of value. I am knowledgeable and have some experience in Finance as well and was wondering if there was a space where I can use these skills, or if I'd be better off learning other things. Just curious as to the work opportunities in Ethereum in general. Any information would be helpful.

nrgg3l,1622734812,An Ethereum Community Story from the Crypto Baron,"I'm sure the over-whelming majority of the community will not remember me (I used to make videos on Ethereum and crypto currency in 2017 like so many others lol), but I wanted to give a heartfelt thank you to all.  In 2016, I was fortunate enough to discover Ethereum while finishing my MBA.  Having an understanding of bitcoin and blockchain technology, it was obvious that this was a special project from the get-go.  Granted, I've lost much of my initial Ethereum along the way (some foolish and some even good ICOs that haven't paced in value or openly exit scammed... and in my LEAST proud moment, I was even scammed out of 100 ether in 2017), but this community has largely understood what they've HODL'd... a nearly invaluable resource.  Despite the growth in price and value, I have HODL'd from $8 to $4300 and remain happily running validators as we TEMPORARILY slip back down to $2500-2800.\n\nThe point of this story is that with just 1 ether purchased at $8, I was able to fund an entire online business I just launched with a supplementary goal of raising money for US Veterans (I, myself, am a Marine Corps Iraq war veteran)--while separating myself from even 1 ether breaks my heart, I'm comforted knowing my validators will make it back and continue contributing to the network.  Further, this is a way I feel I can continue to contribute to the ecosystem as a non-coder... because you can bet your ass we accept payments in Ethereum and you can bet your ass instead of transferring it to cash, I'll HODL that shit as tightly as I did from $8-4300.\n\nAnyway, check us out at [SemperFly.us](https://SemperFly.us) if you want... if not, no worries, keep killing it as a community.  I'll be here, lurking and looking for anyways to help that I can.\n\nStay golden, visionaries.

nriu8x,1622741035,A case for $SHINU,"I'm going to get into $SHINU in a moment, but I wanted to say something first. I've come to realize many of us, myself included, have been dealing with a lot this past year (loss of self esteem, anxiety, depression, loss of loved ones, loss of job of home, family and friends passing away, etc). If you are going through some things as well, and would like to talk about it or just be part of a community that shares, please come visit. Regardless of whether or not you want to join the $SHINU Family and the Project. I'm amazed every day by the amount of compassion and how uplifting this community of strangers are to everyone in it.\n\nAlright, now for why you came.\n\n$SHINU\n\n- Currently only on Uniswap, though with plans to fork in the future.\n- Two weeks old, and still under a million market cap. ATH was six days ago, and about 500% from where we are now. Some early whales who weren't there for the project all left so our distribution is much better, and our holder count has tripled, since they exited.\n- Tokenomics involve an 8% transaction tax. 4% for redistribution and 4% for marketing.\n- No paid marketing has been done, as we want to stick to strictly organic growth until we hit some milestones, which I will list below.\n   - listed on CG and CM (applied)\n   - 3 other additional listings (2/3 done)\n   - Interactive prototype of portfolio up ‚úÖ\n   - Interactive prototype of the DEX up (eta 3 days)\n   - 1,000 holders (mid 641)\n   - 1,000 TG members (584)\n- The reason we are sticking to organic growth until this point in time is that all of us who get in now are true believers in the project and will HODL until a 500 million MC. We don't want pump and dumpers, or mean whales, hurting the project.\n- Dev and team do multiple AMA voice chats with the team weekly to update on everything going on, as well as to answer any questions members have.\n- Both Dev wallets are only 1%, the rest was a true fair launch.\n- Reddit, TG, Twitter, accounts are both active, and the community is active on those and IG, Facebook, 4chan, etc.\n- the DEX is being built around a new code. This will automatically audit all tokens on application to prevent scam tokens, like honeypots, from being listed.\n- If one is applied for, or slips through (new codes always have kinks to work out), the dev behind it is permanently blacklisted from the DEX for that project, as well as all their future projects.\n- DEX will also have an customizable UI that links with all the other $SHINU projects. Think having dextools chart, Uniswaps trading ability, and the profit/loss tracker from Zerion all on one screen.\n- Very active community, and the team delivers on their promises. Before we were two weeks old, the in interactive tracker prototype was up. The interactive DEX prototype is going to be up before we even hit three weeks.\n\nLinks:\n\nContract\n0xa1ab427451f19df7445a22dea7073800ea3b687f\n\nTelegram\nhttps://t.me/ShinigamiInu\n\nDexTools\nhttps://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xa4b063c9e5f372d800d11bd9a245f0d4fdcca379\n\nEtherscan\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xa1ab427451f19df7445a22dea7073800ea3b687f\n\nAgain, even if this project isn't for you, feel free to say hi and just chat if you are going through some things or just need a place to talk it out. We are a community, not just $SHINU but crypto as a whole. With everything going on in the world, it's more important than ever for us to all stick together and build each other up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nriu8x/a_case_for_shinu/,2,31
