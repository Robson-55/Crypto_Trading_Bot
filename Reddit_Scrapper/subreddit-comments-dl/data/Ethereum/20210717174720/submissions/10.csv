The first way I tried (with Argent), charged me a flat fee that equated to 25% of my total purchase amount, so I opted to look into other solutions. Coinbase doesn't let me buy crypto because my ID is not from the country in which I reside (European citizen in North America), Binance affiliates rejected my debit card, and Binance itself isn't allowing me to purchase anything for 3 days while they verify my ID.\n\nTo buy a currency that's supposed to be safe, secure, anonymous, and instant, I've uploaded my ID to 4 different exchanges, one of which is based in the botnet that is China, I've been rejected from two, and I have to wait days until I can access a limited buying amount with Binance.

gp5gch,1590242678,"CRYPTO WEEKLY NEWS — May, 23","What important crypto events happened last week?\n\n1. 50 Bitcoins that have been lying motionless since 2009 have been awakened. Coins were received as a reward for the block on February 9, when the first cryptocurrency network was only a month old. It is believed that these Bitcoins may belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, since at that time only 3-4 people were mining.\n\n2. Bitcoin whales withdrew 17,320 BTC ($ 169.4 million) from the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in just a few hours. The purpose of all these transactions is unknown, neither are the identities of the whales.\n\n3. Bitcoin transaction fees increased by 1250% from April 11th to May 14th. A large portion of the increase came in the days preceding and following the Bitcoin halving.\n\n4. Joan Rowling, the author of Harry Potter books, wondered what Bitcoin is and how it works. Elon Musk, Vitalik Buterin, and hundreds of other Twitter users came to the rescue. Turned out Rowling has only ‘been trolling Bitcoin in the hope of boosting her significant Ethereum holdings.‘ In case you ever wanted to know, Elon Musk owns only 0,25 BTC. And that's it.\n\n5. An unplanned fork occurred on the Ethereum 2.0 test network. Afri Shoedon, the lead developer of the ETH 2.0 multi-client test network, Schlesi, reported chain sharing as a result of a breach of consensus among customers.\n\n6. Russia is not yet ready to accept cryptocurrencies. New bills provide for the introduction of administrative and criminal liability for violation of the rules for working with digital currencies. The State Duma wants to introduce criminal liability for crypto transactions.\n\n7. The Iranian parliament has proposed that cryptocurrencies be included in the current “currency smuggling” legislation, and cryptocurrency exchanges will be required to obtain a license from the Central Bank of Iran to operate in the country, as well as meet the requirements for exchanging foreign currencies.\n\n8. Intruders created a fake account of Sergey Brin (Google Founder) on YouTube and promised 5000 BTC distribution on his behalf. At a certain moment, over 100 thousand people watched the live broadcast. The organizers suggested transferring from 0.1 to 25 BTC in Bitcoins to their account in order to get twice as much. The video and channel are currently unavailable.\n\n9. The first transaction of the year was made from the wallet that stored the Bitcoins stolen from the Bitfinex exchange in 2016. Unknown persons transferred 28.39124 BTC ($258k) to an anonymous address, and 2.275952 BTC ($20.6k) were sent to another wallet as part of the same transaction.\n\n10. Robert Kiyosaki, “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author, says $75,000 Bitcoin possible as the economy is “dying”. \n\n11. John McAfee has been accused of having copied the whitepaper of his Ghost Coin from other similar projects.\n\n12. Kraken exchange creates new jobs. The wives, husbands, mothers, children, and roommates of the current employees were hired thanks to a questionnaire sent to them by the company.\n\nThat’s all for now!\n\n&gt;Keep up with the news of the crypto world at [CoinJoy.io](https://CoinJoy.io)!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coinjoy_today) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@CoinJoy).
