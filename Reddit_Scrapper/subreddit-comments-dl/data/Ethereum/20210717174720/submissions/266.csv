kl1g9q,1609064552,Eth 2.0 Fair Value Calculation Suggestion,"As we get closer and closer to EIP1559 and ETH2.0 coming out I have a simple suggestion for a way to get an estimated fair value of Ether and want your opinions on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Eth2.0 with EIP1559 without Shards**\n\nI am assuming that Eth2.0 without Shards, with Eth1 merged into the beacon chain has the same TPS as Eth1\n\n|Transactions Per Second (TPS)|13|\n|:-|:-|\n|Transactions per year (TPY)|409 968 000|\n|Fee per transaction (FPT)|2 USD|\n|Staking rewards per Year| 224394 Eth|\n\nTPY\*FPT/StakingRewards = EthPrice\n\n(409 968 000 \* 2) / 224394 = 3654 USD\n\nThis would be the price where Eth stops being deflationary with the current Fee per tx, Transactions per year and staking rewards.\n\nIf we get 10 Million Eth staked it changes to 1673 USD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen shards are added the Tps is increased dramatically but Tx fee will most likely fall dramatically too so the total fee burn might stay similar in the beginning until more projects start up as a result of the lower fees and increased adoption. When adoption increases deflation also increases until reaching an equilibrium at a certain price.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kl1g9q/eth_20_fair_value_calculation_suggestion/,1,38
kl20ch,1609067731,"BTC and ETH used to grow together, now ETH is left behind.",I used to own both BTC and ETH and I traded all my BTC for ETH as the goal of staking my ETH. Then obviously the BTC exploded and now reach 28k .. I feel like I did something very stupid. ETH is still awfully low comparing to the evolution of BTC (we are so far away the ATH of Ethereum... ) \nAnyone got any explanation of why ethereum is struggling?\nThanks and take care,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kl20ch/btc_and_eth_used_to_grow_together_now_eth_is_left/,1,68
