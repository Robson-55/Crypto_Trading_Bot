lbpfio,1612364602,Do you actually make a positive ROI on providing liquidity / yield farming ?,"Hi guys just wonderind do you guys actually make a positive ROI providing luqidity/ yield farming. I look at the ROI for pools on example [https://www.liquidityfolio.com/](https://www.liquidityfolio.com/) and it does show huge gain % but it usually never lasts and over a long period of time given impermamnet loss, it usually makes more sense to just hodl. Can someone provide me any insight on successfully making a positive ROI,and picking the right pools. Does it make sense to provide liqudity in a bull market?

lbq84y,1612366699,Can someone provide some clarification?,"I threw some extra $ at some alt coins but ended up transferring back to Ethereum after a small gain. However, the fees are killing me. The process I used was buy ether on coinbase to use for gas. Send the eth to my coinbase wallet. Use uniswap to swap Ethereum for alt. The total fees amounted to about $50. \n\n$1 for purchasing tin coinbase\n$5 for sending to wallet as a miner fee\n$40 to swap using uniswap\n\nAnd then i have to repeat the same process to convert back to Ethereum.
