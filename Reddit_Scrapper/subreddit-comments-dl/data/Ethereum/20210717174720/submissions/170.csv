j6vmpq,1602093060,Does converting Ethereum into other Crypto result in needing to pay taxes?,"Important, need to know as I am swinging a crypto currency with Ethereum right now (buying when it's low, and then selling as it gets high, no conversion to GBP happens) and I am freaking out, can't find clear info about this online.\n\nI am using a Coinbase Hardware wallet on my phone. Someone told me that YES converting Ethereum to any other crypto and then converting it back counts as Capital Gains. But please tell me because I am freaking out and I have no clue if I am gonna get in trouble or not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/j6vmpq/does_converting_ethereum_into_other_crypto_result/,1,11

j73omm,1602119906,Investing in Canadian mortgages on Ethereum with stable coins,"Hi Ethereum community,\n\nWould you be interested in Canadian mortgages investments? TokenFunder is launching a pilot on that, but want to hear your feedback first.\n\n**What Mortgages**: investments will be made through Mortgage Investment Corporations (MIC). Mortgage Investment Corporations are specially-regulated entities in Canada that pool investors' funds across a wide array of mortgages, so you are investing along with other investors and your risk is spread across hundreds of small mortgages. MICs are currently a $14B market in Canada.\n\n**What's The Yield**: targeted **10%**. We have tokenized shares of NestCapital. It's a MIC with $10M AUM, and has been consistently returning 10% APR for the past years. The current targeted return is still 10%. Nest is 100% focused on Canadian residential mortgages, which have performed very well even during the Covid period.\n\n**The Pilot**: We will wrap the Nest tokens, which are KYC-only security tokens, into wNest (similar to Wrapped Nexus Mutual), which will carry the 10% yield, and investors will be able to purchase wNest directly via a sales smart contract with stable coins (USDC, Dai, USDT).\n\nDividend will be accrued daily, which the investor may withdraw from the contract at any time. We will also support buy-backs with 3-5% penalty. A Uniswap pool will be constructed if this gets traction to increase liquidity.\n\n**Legal &amp; Regulations**: TokenFunder is the first and only registered Exempt Market Dealer (similar to broker-dealer in US) in Canada that is officially allowed to issue tokenized securities. Nest Capital tokens are registered at the Ontario Securities Commission, and are issued pursuant to the Offering Memorandum [publicly available here](https://tf-public-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/projects/nestcapital/NestCapital-Offering-Memorandum-V2.pdf).\n\nThe first batch of the pilot will be capped at just \~$3,700USD. If this sees demand, we'll follow up with more.\n\nIs this something the community would be interested in? Please shoot any questions you might have at us, we want to make this work!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/j73omm/investing_in_canadian_mortgages_on_ethereum_with/,1,59
