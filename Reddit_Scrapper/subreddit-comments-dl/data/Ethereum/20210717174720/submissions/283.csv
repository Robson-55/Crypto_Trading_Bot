kqzmjq,1609857545,"Thoughts on hard supply cap, inflation, deflation and ETH vs BTC","Disclaimer: I own both ETH and BTC and I think both have their place in the crytofinancial system.\n\nWhenever I see a discussion about the merits of ETH vs BTC, it often falls back on a discussion about the benefits of a hard supply cap and the ""correct"" inflation policy for a cryptocurrency. I'd like to share an opinion I rarely see, which is that ETH not having a fixed supply cap and being (moderately) inflationary is not necessarily a bad thing, although it does mean that it will never have the same place as BTC in the cryptofinancial system.\n\nFirst, let's look at BTC. BTC has a hard supply cap of 21 million BTC, which means that there will come a time where the last BTC has been mined. Obviously, this makes BTC a strong contender for the reserve asset of the future, since its limited supply means that it is shielded from the effects of runaway inflation (or any inflation for that matter). However, this fixed supply has a downside: it makes BTC a deflationary asset. Put simply, deflation is a phenomenon where the value of a currency is worth more tomorrow than it is today. If you consider the increasing demand for BTC and the fact that some BTC is constantly lost (e.g.: people losing their keys), then it is clear why BTC is a deflationary asset. This is great for hodlers, and I expect BTC to remain king in terms of value growth. However, it makes BTC unusable as the native currency of a the cryptofinancial system since spending BTC incurs an opportunity cost: since BTC is deflationary, it will be worth more in the future and therefore, over the long term, holding BTC remains the strategy that maximizes returns.\n\nUnlike BTC, ETH does not have a fixed supply, which means that it is subject to inflation over the long term. Note that this does not mean that ETH will end up like the Venezuelan bolivar; its inflation policy is bounded and determined by the protocol itself, not by the whims and wishes of any individual. This constant (but manageable) inflation makes ETH easier to spend as ETH is unlikely to ""go up forever"". Once ETH settles at a market cap reflective of the value of the network (whatever that value may be), the constant inflation will prevent ETH from being deflationary. This will mean that spending ETH will not incur as much of an opportunity cost as spending BTC does. This obviously makes ETH less viable as a reserve asset, but it does make ETH a strong contender for the currency of the future, since an economy cannot run if no one is spending (as would be the case with BTC). I therefore expect ETH to become the more useful cryptocurrency out of the two, which we are already somewhat seeing with the rise of DeFi.\n\nThe facts described above have some interesting consequences. For starters, I do not think we will ever see DeFi/smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain, nor would it be a good thing. DeFi with BTC only would suffer from the deflationary effects of BTC (no one would engage in it as the long term opportunity cost of selling BTC for any DeFi asset would outweigh the benefits). On the other hand, this deflation makes BTC the perfect DeFi collateral (we are seeing this already in lending protocols with the amount of BTC locked in smart contracts). This also mean that I think ETH becoming deflationary (because EIP 1559 or something else) might actually harm the Ethereum platform, since if ETH joins BTC as a deflationary reserve asset, the opportunity cost of spending ETH for transaction fees might reduce the viability of dApps. \n\nTL;DR: BTC's fixed supply =&gt; better reserve asset, better collateral, higher opportunity cost when spending, bad currency. ETH's unlimited supply =&gt; less good reserve asset, lower opportunity cost when spending, better currency, more useful. Both compliment each other in the cryptofinancial system and DeFi is only possible with both.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kqzmjq/thoughts_on_hard_supply_cap_inflation_deflation/,1,43

kr6zd7,1609878505,What is proof-of-stake,"Currently popular blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum (which is slowly changing) use **proof-of-work** algorithms to validate transactions and create new blocks. The idea is simple: each miner (participant in the network) has to solve a mathematical puzzle. The first one to do so gets rewarded, while the rest validate his solution. Miners can join mining pools in order to have a higher chance of earning a percentage of the mined coin.\n\nDownfalls of proof-of-work:\n\n* ***huge*** *operation costs* \- it is estimated that both Bitcoin and Ethereum burn over $1,000,000 of electricity and hardware costs per day\n* *the* ***51% attack*** \- a group controls the majority of mining network, enabling it to create fraudulent block and manipulate past transactions\n* ***centralization*** *risk* \- as of April 2019 China is the leader in bitcoin mining, controlling 65% of the processing power of the Bitcoin network.\n\n**Proof-of-stake** does the same job in a vastly different way. Each participant deposits their coins for a certain period of time, then the algorithm chooses one validator based on their stake to validate transactions and create new blocks. \n\nThis solution uses a lot less resources compared to proof-of-work and mitigates the risk of centralization, as no specific and expensive equipment is required to become a validator.\n\nIt also makes the network more secure against the 51% attack, because it would require the attacker to purchase the majority of all existing coins to overtake the network.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kr6zd7/what_is_proofofstake/,1,123
