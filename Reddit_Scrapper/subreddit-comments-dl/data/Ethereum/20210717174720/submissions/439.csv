lxaz67,1614826547,Staking rewards for your own node vs 3rd party,I was wondering how much more staking rewards you receive by doing it yourself vs a 3rd party.\n\nRight now I am staking with Kraken and calculated that I am getting 7.7% yearly. I know they take about 15% which would mean I would be making 9% if I did it on my own. Does this seem like an accurate number?

lxcmg3,1614832222,Proof of Stake Computing Power?,"Posted about this before but it got flagged as spam and deleted.\n\nSimple question: If the network is currently burdened as-is, how will \*reducing\* the computing power by transitioning to proof-of-stake benefit the ""global computer"" that is the Ethereum network in the long run? Or is that not the goal for the network?\n\nI know with Proof of Work, there's currently a lot of garbage bundled with meaningful computation to artificially inflate the workload as a distribution mechanism. Will removing that garbage and vacating all of that computing power still leave a powerful cloud computer in its place? Or will the network's total computing potential be hugely cut back without hundreds of thousands of GPU and teraflops committed to the task?   \n\n\nI guess it's a hybrid proof-of-stake, but the network without that garbage must still have steep computing demands, especially if it were to continue growing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lxcmg3/proof_of_stake_computing_power/,2,18
