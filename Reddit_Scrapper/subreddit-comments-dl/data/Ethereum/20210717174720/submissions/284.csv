I own one and want to buy something for $1000. So I transfer my one ether to the owner of the thing I want. Then the validators get new mined Ether as a fee for validating my transaction right? \n\nThen if we add in burn, who pays the cost of burn.

kra9o6,1609887957,Layer 2 and scattering of Ethereum,"This year we will start seeing projects migrating to the so called layer 2, but I have one concerned I would like to share with you.\n\nOne of the coolest things that I like of Ethereum, is that I can just go to etherscan and see whats happening in the network. Everything is recorded there.\n\nBut what would happen once projects start moving to layer 2? Don't you think this will scatter the network? We will have tons of transactions across different sidechains, zk rollups, optimistic rollups. Perhaps it is not a problem per se, but it worries me.\n\nSome random ideas:\n\n* Lets say we have an ERC20 token X. This token will be swapped in the already existing layer 1 + on multiple rollups and sidechains. The same token will be scattered across many different ""worlds"". Have you heard about any project that aims to keep track of this?\n* Most of the sidechains or rollups have a block explorer, but all of them are different.

krg6m9,1609906962,Criticism of proof-of-stake,"**Hey, mods!** My previous post was removed without providing a reason, so just to let you know: This isn't my personal criticism of proof-of-stake, this is just a summary of the most popular criticism that has been acknowledged by Vitalik himself.\n\nIf you still think this post is not appropriate for this sub, please let me know how I can improve it.\n\n\-------\n\nCheck out my previous post: [What is proof-of-stake?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kr6zd7/what_is_proofofstake/)\n\nEven though proof-of-stake gathers a lot of enthusiasts because of its significantly lower operation costs and decreased risk of centralization compared with proof-of-work, it‚Äôs not completely without criticism.\n\n***Nothing At Stake***: problem -&gt; solution -&gt; bigger problem?\n\nConsensus is the defense mechanism of a blockchain. Every created block has to be approved by the majority of the network, otherwise it‚Äôs rejected. The next question that arises is: **how can we make sure that the majority won‚Äôt approve fraudulent blocks?**\n\nImagine you have two drivers and two identical cars that have no gas in them. Your task is to get one of those cars to a certain far distance as quickly as possible. The catch - you can only spend $20 on gas.\n\nYour best bet is to choose one car and spend all $20 to fuel it up. Splitting the money between them will make sure none reach the finish line.\n\n**Proof-of-work** requires a miner to use external resources (dedicated hardware and electricity) to participate, because of that they have to decide which of all possible forks to contribute to. They could in theory approve both fraudulent and correct blocks, but that *significantly* lowers their chance to be rewarded, making the effort non-profitable - just like splitting 20 bucks for gas for two cars.\n\nIf a blockchain were to use another consensus algorithm, it cannot simply allow participants cost free. Otherwise they‚Äôd approve any block they like while having nothing to lose.\n\n*Solution*: validators have to deposit their coins in order to participate in the network. If they double-vote, they lose their money.\n\nProblem solved, right? Well...\n\n**Will the rich get richer?**\n\nA valid concern is that since proof-of-stake favors those validators who have contributed the most, only the richest participants will be chosen and paid by the algorithm, making them even richer and more likely to be chosen again.\n\nThe man himself seems to dismiss this problem altogether:\n\n&gt;the rewards in general \[...\] will be quite low; in eth2, we are expecting annual validator rewards to equal \~0.5-2% of the total ETH supply. And the more validators are staking, the lower interest rates get. ([source](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html))\n\nOne solution is coin age-based selection implemented by Peercoin: once a stake of coins has been used to validate a block, it must wait for a certain period of time before validating another block.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/krg6m9/criticism_of_proofofstake/,1,21
