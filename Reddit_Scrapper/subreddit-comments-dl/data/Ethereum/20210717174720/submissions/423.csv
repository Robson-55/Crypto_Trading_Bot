In the last 12 months, Ethereum has already settled $2.1 trillion in transactions.\n\nIf Messari’s $1.6 trillion forecast is accurate, Ethereum’s quarterly settlement value will have increased 1,280% compared to Q1 2020, and more than 5,000% compared to Q1 2019. \n\nMessari researcher Ryan Watkins noted the data counters the prevailing narrative that Ethereum is seeing an exodus of users amid its high gas fees, exclaiming:\n\n&gt;**“Incredible scale for a technology that critics claimed couldn’t scale.”**",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ls1afg/some_encouraging_news_actual_data_to_counter/,14,13
