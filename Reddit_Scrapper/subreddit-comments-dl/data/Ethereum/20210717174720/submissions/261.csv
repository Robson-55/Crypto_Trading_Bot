kiogx9,1608707677,Ethereum community I need your attention on this.,"Hi everyone, I started using reddit from a month &amp; the main reason why I started was seeing a community of knowledgable users regarding cryptocurrency. Knowing about cryptocurrency &amp; my love for it had got me a job &amp; under that I share daily content in crypto communities to update them if I have something good to share. \n\nYesterday I shared a post in Ethereum community regarding ‚ÄúArgentina‚Äù that how people are adopting Bitcoins/Ethereum and something that‚Äôs good for cryptocurrency community. (This post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ki6mjn/argentina_sees_a_spike_in_the_number_of_people)\n\nAnd I received appreciation from you guys as well for sharing such content but I don‚Äôt know why 4-5 people started messaging me that ‚ÄúGet out with your spam‚Äù ‚ÄúYour content is garbage‚Äù and more like that.\n\nTill now I have never shared something that‚Äôs spammy in such big communities. I wanna know then why these few people are against me, like are they jealous that my content is being liked? Because they say ‚ÄúYou are doing blog spam‚Äù &amp; I am like, If I shared some content that‚Äôs useful and gives an insight to users on some topic &amp; in the end I just add a ‚Äúsource‚Äù just in case if someone wanna read more, than is that wrong?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kiogx9/ethereum_community_i_need_your_attention_on_this/,1,6

Or has nothing really changed for the my coins from the point of view of investment (likes shares in a company). \n\nPardon me if it all sounds like amateur questions - they are :),https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kiqjb2/eth2_what_about_my_original_eth/,1,7
