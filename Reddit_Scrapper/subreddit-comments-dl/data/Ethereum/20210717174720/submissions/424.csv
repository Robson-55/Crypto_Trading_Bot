lsbosf,1614273634,The Future Is Optimistic!,"As you all know, Ethereum has been struggling with congestion and high fees. This has been anticipated for a while now so the past few years the development community has been working hard on a solution. This March Optimistic Rollups (ORUs) will have their public release.\n\n# Why this matters\n\nA quick ELI5 and history of scaling solutions for Ethereum and why this is a HUGE development. There are several kinds of scalability solutions for Ethereum: State channels like Plasma, sidechains, or rollups.\n\nState channels are only usable for simple transfers so they are of no use for scaling smart contracts. Sidechains are essentially a separate blockchain with their own set of validators; and mostly the number of validators is quite low which introduces centralization issues.\n\nEnter Optimistic Rollups. They support the EVM which means they can scale smart contracts. Optimism can do anywhere from 500 - 2000 TPS (current is \~14-34), with super low fees (less than a cent), while maintaining security and decentralization.\n\nFurther, Optimistic Rollups do not have a token so all gas on the rollup will be paid in ETH, keeping utility with the token and a better user experience.\n\n# Path to adoption\n\nStarting in March, any existing dApp on Ethereum can literally copy/paste their code to Optimism with little changes and get going. They made the process extremely easy with a compiler that developers can just plug in their existing Solidity code and it automatically ports everything to be Optimistic compatible.\n\nCurrently Synthetix is on Optimistic as a limited release. Uniswap, Chainlink, and Compound have already announced they will also migrate to Optimistic. With those large applications there and the easy of migration, a significant part of Ethereum's ecosystem will move there as well. Uniswap already has a demo of their Optimistic implementation, [Unipig](https://unipig.exchange/join-team), which has actually been released for a year. Once ORU is released in March it likely won't be long before we start seeing a flurry of announcements of projects migrating over.\n\nThere's still fees to get to L2 from L1, though. A key component to making this transition as seamless, easy, and affordable as possible is getting wallet providers on board to withdraw funds directly to L2. Coinbase has indicated support for Optimism, which means many users will never have to touch Layer 1. [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/), an open source wallet protocol that many projects use, already has an alpha build ([see preview](https://imgur.com/a/Ee09Ryf)) with Optimistic Rollups integrated.\n\nThis effectively eliminates the high gas fee issue for Ethereum without sacrificing decentralization. It's what everyone has been waiting for, and it's here in March!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** L2 adoption is coming much faster than everyone thinks. Optimistic Rollups will be open to public in March. Uniswap, Compound, and Chainlink will join Synthetix on Optimistic and others will follow. Coinbase and other wallets will support direct withdraws to Optimistic L2. Users can deposit their funds with a single transaction and then enjoy the complete ecosystem of Ethereum with extremely low gas fees and high TPS, while being entirely noncustodial and decentralized.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lsbosf/the_future_is_optimistic/,207,189
