iqs3qz,1599836380,Volta solves the trilemma,"Hey everyone, me and my team are developing a new blockchain called Volta that strives to solve the trilemma by implementing a combination of base layer changes, such as sharding, with higher level changes, such as Avalanche, off-chain state channels, and sidechains. Phase one will comprise Avalanche and sharding, giving us a TPS between 16,000,000 and 160,000,000 without needing to rely on supernodes or any other centralizing BS. Check out our website and whitepaper at indyvolt.com and our subreddit r/VoltaChain and please get back to me with any questions or concerns.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/iqs3qz/volta_solves_the_trilemma/,1,3

irewym,1599925583,"The legality of unregistered, unlicensed lending? Legality of stablecoins?","With all this defi hype, I don't see very many people questioning the legality of some of these functions. In most countries, lending is allowed because two willing participants agree to a written contract. A contract is essentially a group of people privatizing a set of laws that take precedent over public law. ""Smart contracts"" are not legal contracts. A legal contract must have actual print and a signature of all participants acknowledging the terms of the agreement. Just because you have software executing a code, that doesn't make it a legal contract.\n\nThere's a real fundamental problem with stablecoins: any system that effectively allows decentralized peer-to-peer transmission of money is going to fail one or more anti-money-laundering laws. Stablecoins are fundamentally illegal operations under US law. With bitcoin, you can squish around and call it a commodity instead of money. But stable coins are being marketed as 1:1 equivalent to USD, which is money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/irewym/the_legality_of_unregistered_unlicensed_lending/,1,18
