k2ncbz,1606568774,Possible EIP proposal: Elliptic SSS scheme,"Hi everyone!¬†\n\nWould like to propose the solution for sharing the private key / other sensitive information with a modified SSS scheme.¬†\n\nThe key features are:\n1) the secret restoration is not possible without corresponding signatures\n2) share[i] belongs to privateKey[i] only, which means it can't be signed with a different private key\n\nI hope this approach can help on the application level to share sensitive information or it can be used as m-of-n multi-signature (this is discussable). Here is the repo with a concept description and working example in node.js:¬†https://github.com/ega-forever/esss\n\nAny comments are appropriated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/k2ncbz/possible_eip_proposal_elliptic_sss_scheme/,1,2
