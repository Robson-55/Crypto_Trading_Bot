nix4sq,1621733611,Biggest risks to Ethereum?,"I‚Äôd like to get a thread going here on Ethereum risks.  We‚Äôre all so bullish, but fact is crypto is risky!  I‚Äôm a crypto noobie, but I work in cybersecurity and I‚Äôm paid to think about this.\n\nI‚Äôm not looking for general crypto risks, like regulation, 51% attacks, getting your wallet hacked or locked out of your wallet.  I want Eth-specific risks!! \n\nHere‚Äôs a few I can think of off the top of my head, but like I said - I‚Äôm a noobie.\n\n1. If Vitalik disappears, will Eth pull through long-term? While he doesnt want any power, from what I can tell he‚Äôs kind of the life blood of the project\n\n2. New entrants. Cardano is getting pretty popular, and you have to imagine other Ethereum-type networks will make an attempt\n\n3. Something about high fees and or slow transactions?
