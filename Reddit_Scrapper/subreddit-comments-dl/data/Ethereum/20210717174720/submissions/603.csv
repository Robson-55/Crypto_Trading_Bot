I would like to hold a competition on a meme contest where the funniest (or most upvoted meme) wins a little bit of crypto.\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n1. Has to be related to ETH gas frees and how they are generally too high compared to other chains. The more you exaggerate the funnier I believe.\n2. Has to be posted as a comment under this post.\n3. Has to have at least 30 meme submissions before a winner is decided.\n4. Has to have the most upvotes by May 15th\n\nThe winner gets 0.1 BNB! I would prefer to send you ETH instead but the fees are too high for that haha.\n\nI know 0.1 BNB isn't much, but it's a lot for making a funny meme!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoodluck, everyone! looking to Laugh from the communities creativity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n4i7qz/meme_competition_winner_gets_crypto/,1,9

If you look at their job postings on LinkedIn you will see they are looking for Solidity programmers.\n\nI think JPM has a big stake of Eth and when Eth moves to PoS they will own most of the network in terms of stake, so they are rising the price to prevent competitors to have also a big stake and control the network.\n\nNow I do not know the details of the PoS algorithm of Eth, but it seems to me if you have a big stake you will be able to control the network.\n\nGiven that most dapps have been built in Eth, the cost of switching to a forked version could be too high for the community.\n\nHow will the community prevent JPM to take control?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n4jabz/ethereum_network_will_be_under_jpm_control_once/,1,39
