Saw that the problem was setting gas limits too low in the first transactions. Tried by upping that too. Still ate up about 332$! Don't know what to do anymore :,(. It always showing Status as Failed and says - Warning! Error encountered during contract execution \[**Out of gas**\]  in the ' To' section . It's demoralizing and I am a noob. What is wrong?

na3vx0,1620757652,Please Help a Newbie who got FOMO," \n\nI tried to buy some SHIB yesterday using Uniswap and Coinbase Wallet.\n\nI already had Coinbase so I figured Coinbase Wallet would be the easiest for me. I bought $500 USDC because the fees were lower than ETH and Uniswap had the option to go from USDC-SHIB.\n\nI went on Uniswap and it told me I had to pay a gas fee in ETH first. This was just to allow me to use USDC. The fee was like $30 worth of ETH... So I paid\n\nThen I tried to swap from USDC to SHIB and the Miner fees were like $300!!!\n\nThis seems ridiculous to me. At this point, I just want to cut my losses and transfer my balance in USDC back to my bank account. I can't do it from Coinbase Wallet &amp; to transfer my USDC to Coinbase I have to pay another $150 in gas fees!\n\nAny advice would be great.

na447v,1620758253,Too little gas,"Hi All,\n\nI tried transferring some Eth from my Exodus wallet to my Trezor wallet just before the gas prices went all crazy.  Now, since I'm a cheap ass, I ended up lowering my gas to be used to a slow exchange (54 Gwei).  I'm okay with waiting some time for it to validate, since I'm sending it to myself.\n\nNow that the gas prices have jumped, I'm thinking this transaction will be stuck indefinitely, maybe it was too low to begin with.... and after looking at [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/) the slow transaction looks to be about 270 Gwei, so I'm way off.\n\nI've checked out the [https://info.etherscan.com/how-to-cancel-ethereum-pending-transactions/#replacing-cancel-pending-transactions](https://info.etherscan.com/how-to-cancel-ethereum-pending-transactions/#replacing-cancel-pending-transactions) link on how to cancel, and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6xbcjNDFO0) laid it out nicely too.  But it seems that you have to initiate it from the software wallet itself (is that right?) and I've contacted Exodus support, but they seem to be slammed at the moment.  Does anyone have insight on how to clear this up?  Is my best course of action just waiting (will gas prices go back down to where 54 would work?)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/na447v/too_little_gas/,1,9
