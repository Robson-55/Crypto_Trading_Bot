lq29gx,1614033909,Highest passive income with DeFi yield farming and staking on YPro,"The introduction of the DeFi sector has brought unexpected disruptions in the world's financial system. Part of which came along with a lot of hype surrounding its new products and features. One of these features that have become commonplace amongst the industry is DeFi Yield Farming. This unique protocol allows new users to earn a passive income with very little understanding of the market conditions and cryptocurrencies in general. \n\nDeFi yield farming or staking allows individuals to earn tokens in exchange for their participation in DeFi applications. Currently, users can stake [stablecoins](https://www.securities.io/stablecoins-within-digital-securities/), such as Dai, USDT, or USD Coin, along with endless platform governance tokens. It‚Äôs also possible to yield farm using cryptocurrencies such as Ether as most platforms reside on the [Ethereum](https://www.securities.io/buy-ethereum/) [blockchain](https://www.securities.io/what-is-blockchain-technology/) at this moment. For these reasons, DeFi yield farming is one of the fastest-growing crypto investment sectors in the market.\n\nYpro finance is set to launch its farming feature on the 4th of March after it was listed on the highly revered UNISWAP. Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange which facilitates automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain through the use of smart contracts. It enables users to swap almost any [ERC20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token pair without intermediaries. How much liquidity providers are paid is based on the percentage of the liquidity pool that they provide. When funding the pool, they are usually required to fund two different assets to enable traders to switch between one to the other by trading them in pairs. Liquidity providers must stake both sides of the liquidity pool in a ratio, and in return earn a proportion of transaction fees. Ypro finance offers a smart approach and great long term opportunity to users and investors with the strategy of offering users and investors small share of transaction fees for contributing liquidity to its yield farming. Ypro finance is pushing to build out its product and partnerships as partners will be crucial to solve the chicken-and-egg problem of getting its first lenders and borrowers. \n\nYPro Finance yield farming attempts to correct a few major issues plaguing the market at this time. Primarily, ypro finance yield farming provides new crypto users an easier alternative to earn a passive income. Compared to trading cryptocurrencies, ypro‚Äôs approach to yield farming requires less understanding and effort. In this way, it provides a more secured alternative to trading cryptocurrencies without experience. Consider investing in ypro finance today.\n\n   \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kannk6kyx3j61.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47e03fbd6a453ac296b372460ea15812da51c546\n\n   \n \n\nYPro Token Uniswap trading - YPRO/ETH pair: [https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xe79644f9be698c8c7a94df66abb7d7ca04c553f5](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xe79644f9be698c8c7a94df66abb7d7ca04c553f5)\n\nWebsite: [http://www.ypro.finance](http://www.ypro.finance/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lq29gx/highest_passive_income_with_defi_yield_farming/,1,0

Over the past few months the gas fees have grown to proportions that make Fiat trading much better and the price of ETH's growth whilst great for ROI can be problematic when trying to set a stable return for work. Sooooo....my question is: Should we ditch the token and build a blockchain to create our own mined token? Or should we stay with the ERC20 token and build in algorithms for linking the PoP to USD so it adjusts accordingly and place payment gas fees (transfer to client) onto the client? Or, is there another idea you might suggest, such as a different platform for PoP (Binance/BTC/Monero/Cardano)\n\nThoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lq2swv/question_should_we_use_an_eth_based_token_create/,1,11
