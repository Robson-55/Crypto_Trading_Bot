In a nutshell, my idea would be to establish a vote-backed IPFS directory that could replace the global cache on [NixOS](https://nixos.org), with voter trust scores (linked to a machine or wallet) to protect against injection of fake build artifacts.\n\nWould it be possible to use an Ethereum contract to uphold the voting mechanism and ""accept"" artifacts on a certain slot (input set hash)?
