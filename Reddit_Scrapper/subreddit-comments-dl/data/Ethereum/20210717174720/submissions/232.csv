k4ito7,1606820498,Looking for feedback - Delphi smart contract for Oracles,"Hello everyone,\n\nI would like to introduce you to [Delphi](https://hashelot.com/dapps/delphi/), a smart contract for acting as Oracles which I'm beta testing on the Ropsten network.\n\nDelphi lets anyone become - `makeMeAnOracle(uint _minimumReward)` - and play the role of an Oracle. No token needed.\n\nOnce a user has become an Oracle any other user can ask a question (limited to 32 characters) - `askTheOracle(Oracle _oracle, bytes32 _question, uint _openNum)` - if they provide a reward for the answer. The Oracle sets a minimum amount for such reward, under which no question can be asked.\n\nDelphi's parent contract gets 0.1% of each reward.\n\nYou can play around with the interface, with the use of MetaMask, and here you can find some specs:\n\nSolidity code: [Hashelot Delphi](https://github.com/mauponti/hashelot/blob/master/apps/ethereum/delphi/solidity/hashelot_delphi_1.0_beta.sol).\n\nTransaction hash:\n[0x275fbd...6ee4cf](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x275fbda6b04608f3eff3473eb09f3bc4ca06c921e948764007f0614dde6ee4cf).\n\nLet me know if you like the idea of Delphi and what you'd change about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/k4ito7/looking_for_feedback_delphi_smart_contract_for/,1,0
