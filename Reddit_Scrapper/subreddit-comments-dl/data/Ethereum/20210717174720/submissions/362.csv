lcnm6z,1612466502,my 1st cryptocurrency ever!,"hey everyone!\n\nJust wanted to say thank you for all the great advice I've seen here! It really helped push me over the edge and I finally purchased my first ETH! Everyone's advice has been great altho i bought at the ATH i followed the DCA rule, I invested some and left some fiat aside for when/if a dip occurs so that I can purchase more! If not at least i got in before another ATH!\n\nI remember in 2014/2015 I waned to buy BTC and i said no way too high! I'm definitely not letting this chance slip by me again!\n\nI've also learnt so much abt DeFi and dapps etc very excited to continue to hodl! and learn.\n\nI recommend The Infinite Machine: How an Army of Crypto-hackers Is Building the Next Internet with Ethereum by Camila Russo to anyone interested in Ethereum it was a great joy to read with some really insightful information!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lcnm6z/my_1st_cryptocurrency_ever/,50,15
