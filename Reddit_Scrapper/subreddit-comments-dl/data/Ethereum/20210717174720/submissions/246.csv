In the research I have done so far I have read about ""hardware"" wallets, how exactly do these work, and how do I buy coin to put in these wallets. Also, once I have bought some ethereum, Is there a way I can easily check how much I have etc, like I would on my regular banking app for example. I know these might be some basic questions, I just want to know all possible options.
