lm1cw1,1613587081,A model for cryptocurrency to compete with banks in the mortgage space. Thoughts?,"As Ethereum now approaches the market cap of JPM, I've been thinking through ways that crypto could compete with more traditional financial institutions. I'm going to focus on the idea of using crypto for a mortgage. Bear in mind that all of this is purely speculative. None of this is financial advice, I'm just posing a hypothetical scenario for how crypto could be used to compete with banks. Here's what I could imagine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoal: Use crypto to finance mortgages to offer more competitive pricing than banks.\n\nRisk: The volatility of crypto poses the biggest risk for something like a 30 year mortgage. Therefore, it's necessary that there's financial instruments used to stabilize or lock in the price of crypto for the underlying mortgage issued.\n\nRisk mitigation: I could see an institution creating crypto mortgages by using [ladder put options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/ladderoption.asp#:~:text=A%20ladder%20option%20is%20an,levels%20before%20the%20option%20expires) over a 30 year mortgage, to ""lock in"" a certain price for the issued mortgage and to protect against downside risk. Obviously this would be complicated to calculate, mortgages and premium purchased would probably be bundled together to average out risk for clients. There would be fees involved, but I could see this being the focus of an institution seeking to compete with pricing offered by banks.\n\nRates/fees: This kind of product would likely produce variable rate for mortgages, due to premium incurred by purchasing laddered put option contracts. However, in years of upwards price action, rates could shrink to nothing, there could be shared profit between the homebuyer and the issuing financial institution should the underlying currency rise in value, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall this is a very simplistic, hypothetical map of how crypto could be used. Having institutions use instruments to protect against downside risk eliminates, in part, the need for a stable coin. With the total value of all cryptocurrencies exceeding a trillion dollars, I think it's interesting to think through how crypto could be used to compete directly with more traditional financial institutions. In this case, an attempt to offer more competitive pricing for 15 / 30 year mortgages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis scenario becomes more likely in a rising interest rate environment. Obviously the fed is now printing like their Xerox, and it'll be a while before the dollar tightens and interest rates rise again. However, the fed's actions seem to be a win / win for crypto. If the fed keeps printing, a capped supply cryptocurrency looks more appealing. If the fed tightens the money supply, and banks start charging more for loans, mortgages, etc. I could see cryptocurrencies used in a way to compete with product offered by banks. If this idea seems unlikely in the United States, it feels more likely in certain parts of the developing world, where currencies and financial instruments can sometimes be dubious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts on this idea?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lm1cw1/a_model_for_cryptocurrency_to_compete_with_banks/,1,5
