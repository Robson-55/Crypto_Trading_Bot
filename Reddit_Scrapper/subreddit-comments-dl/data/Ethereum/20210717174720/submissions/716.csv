Aside from building a client that will be familiar to Typescript/Javascript developers, our main focus is making light clients a reality for Eth2! Together with the other official Eth2 client teams like Prysm, Lighthouse, Nimbus, Teku, etc., we are building towards a vision of a diverse, multi-client Eth2 ecosystem!\n\n# üéâ  Our Lodestar team actually created a [light client prototype](https://showcase.ethglobal.co/scaling/lodestar-light-client) üéâ \n\nfor the Scaling Ethereum hackathon recently, and we will release a separate blog post detailing how light clients work, and why the Eth2 Altair hardfork enables light clients to exist in the first place! (Hint: sync committees). Coming up soon, so stay tuned!!!\n\n# [Lodestar's recent progress, metrics, and other oddities](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestars-recent-progress-metrics-and-other-oddities-49c6e646e421) üî≠\n\nNevertheless, we wanted to give the Eth2 community a separate update on our progress aside from light clients. We wrote about Lodestar node stabilization, how our progress with Altair-compatibility has been, how metrics are \*critical\* to our success with troubleshooting and measuring our node performance, and validator performance and profitability!\n\nCheck out the blog post [here](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestars-recent-progress-metrics-and-other-oddities-49c6e646e421)!\n\nIf you're curious about Lodestar or any of our other work, we would **love** to hear from the community. If you'd like, drop us a message here, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chainsafeth), or on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QtNsCXEA) under the #Lodestar channel!\n\nCiao for now,\n\n[Tim](https://twitter.com/haochizzle) :)\n\n*\[Mods, I hope this post does not break the rules!

I love Ethereum, I‚Äôve been building on it for years and am heavily invested. \n\nBut this whole narrative that proof of stake will remove control from the miners and being it back to the people is absurd if in order to run a node you need to stake 32 ETH. \n\nSure, a $5 Raspberry Pi is an extremely inefficient way to mine Bitcoin but at least you can participate in the network without needing to compromise your security. \n\nThe only way to participate in PoS on Ethereum with as little as $5 would be to join a centralized pool and throw security out the window. \n\nWe are replacing rich and powerful people who can afford mining equipment and server farms with rich and powerful people who can afford to own 32 ETH. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt any better than Bitcoin/PoW for the moral/‚Äúmore decentralized‚Äù reasons you are all spouting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nkxq84/unpopular_opinion_pos_is_not_more_decentralized/,1,1

nkxrwq,1621970507,"Best explanation for ""What is gas?""","&amp;#x200B;\n\n**""Gas"" is the name for a special unit used in Ethereum.** It measures how much ""work"" an action or set of actions takes to perform: for example, to calculate one [Keccak256](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/550/which-cryptographic-hash-function-does-ethereum-use) cryptographic hash it will take [30 gas each time a hash is calculated](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/params/protocol_params.go), plus a cost of 6 more gas for every 256 bits of data being hashed. **Every operation that can be performed by a transaction or contract on the Ethereum platform costs a certain number of gas**, with operations that require more computational resources costing more gas than operations that require few computational resources.\n\nThe reason gas is important is that **it helps to ensure an appropriate fee is being paid** by transactions submitted to the network. By requiring that a transaction pay for each operation it performs (or causes a contract to perform), we ensure that network doesn't become bogged down with performing a lot of intensive work that isn't valuable to anyone. This is a different strategy than the Bitcoin transaction fee, which is based only on the size in kilobytes of a transaction. Since Ethereum allows [arbitrarily complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) computer code to be run, a short length of code can actually result in a lot of computational work being done. So **it's important to measure the work done directly instead of just choosing a fee based on the length of a transaction or contract**.\n\nSo if gas is basically a transaction fee, how do you pay it? This is where it gets a little tricky. **Although gas is a unit that things can be measured in, there isn't any actual** ***token*** **for gas. That is, you can't own 1000 gas.** Instead, gas exists only inside of the Ethereum virtual machine as a count of how much work is being performed. **When it comes to actually** ***paying*** **for the gas, the transaction fee is charged as a certain number of** ***ether***, the built-in token on the Ethereum network and the token with which miners are rewarded for producing blocks.\n\nThis might seem odd at first. **Why don't operations just have a cost measured in ether directly?** The answer is that ether, like bitcoins, have a market price that can change rapidly! But the cost of computation doesn't go up or down just because the price of ether changes. So **it's helpful to separate out the price of computation from the price of the ether token**, so that the cost of an operation doesn't have to be changed every time the market moves.\n\nThe terminology here gets a little messy. Operations in the EVM have gas **cost**, but gas itself also has a gas **price** measured in terms of ether. Every transaction specifies the gas *price* it is willing to pay in ether for each unit of gas, allowing the market to decide the relationship between the price of ether and the cost of computing operations (as measured in gas). **It's the combination of the two, total gas used multiplied by gas price paid, that results in the total fee paid by a transaction**.\n\nAs tricky as it is, it's important to understand this distinction, because it results in one of the most confusing things about Ethereum transactions to the initial learner: **there is a difference between your transaction running out of gas and your transaction not having a high enough fee**. If the **gas price** I set in my transaction is too low, no one will even bother to run my transaction in the first place. It will simply not be included in the blockchain by miners. But if I provide an acceptable gas *price*, and then my transaction results in so much computational work that the combined **gas costs** go past the amount I attached as a fee, **that gas counts as ""spent""** and I don't get it back. The miner will stop processing the transaction, revert any changes it made, **but still include it in the blockchain as a ""failed transaction"", collecting the fees for it**. This may seem harsh, but when you realise that the real work for the miner was in performing the computation, you can see that they will never get those resources back either. So **it's only fair that you pay them for the work they did**, even though your badly designed transaction ran out of gas.\n\nProviding too big of a fee is also different than providing too much ether. **If you set a very high gas price, you will end up paying lots of ether for only a few operations**, just like setting a super high transaction fee in bitcoin. You'll definitely be prioritised to the front of the line, but your money is gone. If you provided a normal gas price, however, and just **attached more ether than was needed to pay for the gas that your transaction consumed, the excess amount will be refunded back to you**. Miners only charge you for the work that they actually do. **You can think of the gas price as the hourly wage for the miner, and the gas cost as their timesheet of work performed**.\n\nThere are a lot of other subtleties to gas, but that should give you the basics! **Gas is the key mechanism that makes the complex computations in Ethereum ""safe"" for the network to work on**, because any programs that run out of control will only last as long as the money provided by the people who requested they be run. When the money stops, the miners stop working on it. And **the mistakes you make in your program will only affect the people who pay to use it**\--the rest of the network can't suffer performance issues due to your error. They will simply get a big payday when the performance issues consume all of your ether! Without this critical technique, the idea of a general-purpose blockchain would have been completely impossible.\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n* Gas is the way that fees are calculated\n* The fees are still paid in ether, though, which is different from gas\n* The gas **cost** is the amount of work that goes into something, like the number of hours of labour, whereas the gas **price** is like the hourly wage you pay for the work to be done. The combination of the two determines your total transaction fee.\n* If your gas *price* is too low, no one will process your transaction\n* If your gas *price* is fine but the gas *cost* of your transaction runs ""over budget"" the transaction fails but still goes into the blockchain, and you don't get the money back for the work that the labourers did.\n* **This makes sure that nothing runs forever, and that people will be careful about the code that they run. It keeps both miners and users safe from bad code!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ^(Source:) [^(https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3/what-is-meant-by-the-term-gas)](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3/what-is-meant-by-the-term-gas)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nkxrwq/best_explanation_for_what_is_gas/,1,7
