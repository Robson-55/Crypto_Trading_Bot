kobj3v,1609508887,What are your thoughts on creating a S.A.F.E company (Sustainable Autonomous Financial Enterprise),"The premise of this idea struck me after reading about an article about this website called Pornhub (never heard of it before until reading this article sksksk), converting to crypto only payments to run their business. Similarly, we saw a similar instance with Spencer Dinwiddie (NBA player) tokenizing his contract and Russell Okung (NFL Player) accepting his payment in Bitcoin. So this got me to offer up this question, late at night, half dazed on the NYE resolutions:\n\n“&gt; What is a term we can coin for businesses or people  that want to be fully financially decentralized?\n&gt; For example, when it comes to companies promoting sustainability. You have businesses being carbon-neutral, water positive, solar powered etc..\n&gt; We need a term like that, but for companies who want to be financially decentralized”\n\nThat’s what sparked this theory crafted session on this discord. Discord user justin bebis, offered up the term “Sustainable Autonomous Financial Enterprise or SAFE. We know it sounds dumb, but it’s some what marketable”, he says\n\nWhat would be included into a SAFE? \n\nWell for starters a company that chooses to default to crypto only payment solutions.\n\nAnother consideration that could be added was\n\n“ I also like the idea of having completely decentralized companies, similar to what Aragon is doing” - Clément\n\nSo what are you all thoughts of coining this new term for the etherspace?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kobj3v/what_are_your_thoughts_on_creating_a_safe_company/,1,3
