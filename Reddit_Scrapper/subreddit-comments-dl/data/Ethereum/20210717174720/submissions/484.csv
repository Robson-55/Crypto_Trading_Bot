mgm744,1617127856,Is 14% the cost to participate?,"Made my first ETH purchase on 3/27. Used My Ethereum Wallet (MEW)to buy $100 of ETH. Simplex receipt shows 0.048ETH purchase was complete 7:30pm for a value of $81.79, transaction fee of $3.97. Bank transaction for $100 complete. Can anyone help me understand where $14.24 went?\n\nIs 14% the cost to participate? Did I choose the wrong wallet? Is there a better way to buy? Please help me understand or point me in the right direction. Thankful for any guidance and advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mgm744/is_14_the_cost_to_participate/,1,25

mgq07y,1617138315,Capping the number of actively attesting validators,"One of the annoyances of the beacon chain protocol is that the difficulty of verifying blocks to keep up with the chain potentially varies widely. Currently, there are \~100,000 validators, but theoretically the number can go anywhere up to \~4 million. This is unfortunate, because the *possibility* of the validator count going that high means that client devs have to work harder to make their clients able to handle that amount and node operators have to make sure their hardware can handle it, but that extra computation capability never actually gets used in practice.\n\nThere have recently been some proposals to mitigate this problem, and they tend to have to do with the idea of implementing a cap on the number of active validators (proposed numbers for the cap have been \`2\*\*19\` validators \~= 16.7M ETH and \`2\*\*20\` validators \~= 33.5M ETH staking). If there are more active validators than the cap, some of the validators are randomly probabilistically ""slept"" for a short period of time (eg. a few hours to a few days). Asleep validators get no rewards, but they also have no responsibilities and can even go offline for that duration. Theoretically, it's even safe to give the opportunity for asleep validators to withdraw more quickly if they choose to exit.\n\nHere's a concrete proposal: [https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022](https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022)\n\nImplementing something like this will reduce the load of verifying the beacon chain, making it easier for both validators and non-validators to run a node, and it will also make decentralized staking pools more viable because it will be more practical for each decentralized staking pool participant to run a node.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mgq07y/capping_the_number_of_actively_attesting/,1,39

mgsj3k,1617145863,Is the concept of STORJ ethical?,"Hear me out. I am trying to maintain an open mind and observe different thought processes when I make my decision. I am considering buying STORJ, but I have a lot of questions on how ethical it is. \n\nIf I understand it correctly, this project on the Ethereum chain allows for decentralized cloud storage. Of course, this means that no one can monitor the type of content/information that gets stored on STORJ. This is obviously good because my information isn't Google's or Apple's- it's decentralized. I like that because they cannot use that information to make **me** their product (through selling that information to other companies). \n\nHowever, this cloud storage being decentralize could also theoretically mean that these nodes have God knows what sort of data. All the illegal stuff possible. Of course, the same thing was said about BTC back in the day, and I understand that. But there is, at least in my mind, a difference in ethics between the **currency** *used* to pay a terrorist and potentially **storing literal data involved in a terrorist plot**. \n\nPerhaps a Star Wars illustration: I wouldn't feel bad if I ended up with the same Credit that  came from the profits from making the Death Star, but literally storing the plans to the Death Star on my computer (without even knowing it) is potentially another question, ethically speaking, \n\nHas anyone else thought this through?
