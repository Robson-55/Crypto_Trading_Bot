n31u9h,1619942655,Almost at 1 ETH!,"Hi ETH community.  So I’ve been slowly dollar cost averaging up to 1 ETH.  I now have a chunk of capital to make it up to the magic 1. I know for a lot of people here thats not a big deal. But for me it’s a massive milestone on my crypto journey.\n\nSo my question is: Should I bite the bullet and ‘level up?’ Keep dollar cost averaging,  or wait till ETH 2.0 launch and wait for a possible dump in a ""Buy the rumour sell the news"" scenario. \n\nI know it’s a bit of a Rock Paper Scissors style question. I guess I’m most interested in wether people think there will be a dump after the new upgrades leading to a lovely sale.
