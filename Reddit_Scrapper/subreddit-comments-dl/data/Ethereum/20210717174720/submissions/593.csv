n3nv1z,1620016184,Need help understanding eth - control,"I‚Äôve been reading and learning more about crypto as I‚Äôve started investing but I need help with one thing‚Ä¶ who controls crypto? Using eth as the subject here, it‚Äôs a decentralized peer to peer protocol, not backed or owned by a corporation or government, and due to the nature of the protocol the blockchain is exceptionally secure and stable. \n\nBut then I hear about things like protocol changes, forks, etc. and think that somebody must have access to edit the protocol code so make these improvements. Is this one person? (The creator of eth, for instance?) if so, it seems like an extraordinary chink in the armor, as that one person could be seduced, persuaded, or coerced into damaging or destroying the entire protocol (or if he died suddenly, the network no longer can improve). \n\nOn the flip side, if it‚Äôs open source, then hypothetically anybody could do this. \n\nIs it the miners who all vote and review the code change, then once consensus is reached they vote and eth adds the change? \n\nI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre at a machine learning point where the protocol improves itself, so im looking for answers. \n\nThis question stumps me when I discuss eth with family and friends and it comes up often",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n3nv1z/need_help_understanding_eth_control/,1,8
