I managed to save up $300 and got it to about $3k mostly by buying low.cap coins. I stayed away from Uniswap and Ethereum as a whole because the gas fees were just too much, but when I hit around $2k i bought RVP (at 1.6c) and it paid off well, luring me further into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNow This is where i messed up; I FOMO'd into TRUEBIT a few days ago and left too little ETH (0.004) and now I can't sell any of ty tokens. all the money i have is in those 2 coins, and yet I can't access it. I never should have ignored the 'have an emergency fund' advice. Is there any way out of this situation? can I somehow borrow ETH? (doubt anyone would take RVP and TRU as collateral though).

EIP-1559 addresses inflation and makes choosing fees for transactions easier. \n\nThat alone will be a supply shock similar to a Bitcoin halving. Where inflation drops. We know how that affects BTC. \n\nWhat is less discussed is the following:\n\nA large portion of Rewards will transition from ETH Miners to ETH Owners. We don‚Äôt have BTC as an example for the effect of that transition. \n\nI‚Äôm curious what are the best and worst case scenarios from that. Not price, because we can all deduce it‚Äôs positive.
