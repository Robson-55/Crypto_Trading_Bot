nrreen,1622763894,Ethereum Vs. Solana: Design philosophy,"Disclaimer: This post is focused on theoretical paradigms and not practicality. If that's not your thing just move on, this is not for you.\n\nThere are a lot of conversations about which blockchain is best. Most would point to Solana's TPS being game changing. Incredibly fast transactions, cheap fees.\n\nThey usually don't like to talk about the cost, which is that the Solana chain will theoretically not be able to match Ethereum's security and decentralization, which for many future blockchain applications is more important than speed.\n\nWhile most chains are simply copying Ethertheum's paradigm, never coming close to attaining the most important aspect for the blockchain, locked in value, Solana is functioning on an actual original paradigm, to maximize the use of computational resources to process a blockchain.\n\n**Proposition:** The primary value to reflect the security of a chain is the amount of value locked in and the amount of validators for the network.\n\nEthereum's  primary goal was to create a wide spread Turing complete consensus network. This design involves as little computational demand as possible while still maintaining a standard to achieve as much adoption as possible.\n\nSolana's primary goal was to maximize the limitations of a computer in a Turing complete consensus network. This design involves as much parallel processing and efficient data propagation as computationally possible to achieve maximum theoretical network ability.\n\n**The most important aspect of a blockchain is security but security/speed ratio is the bottleneck for blockchains.** This means in a perfect world where there is infinite computer resources and locked in value, Solana's paradigm is superior because it maximizes resources and resources are plentiful and everything is already secure. Note, We should also consider that Ethereum employs a 51% rule while Solana a 33% in a true technical comparison but this is mainly theoretical and for arguments sake we will just equate(reduce speed to make equal) and ignore this as its not the point of the post.\n\nIn a realistic world, Ethereum is superior. This is because there is still so much value in the world not in Ethereum so having locked in value and greater accessibility is more important for mass adoption.\n\nWhat this means is that Ethereum is building the world's network but sacrificing maximum speed. Having a network focused on speed instead of security will then always be useful because there are processes where performance values speed over security at a certain level.\n\nEthereum's design philosophy is more important for the near future of blockchain. Solana's design philosophy is for the long term future of blockchain and will help make up for Ethereum's short term faults. Ethereum could theoretically employ Solana designs in the far future when base computers have progressed enough but this would be in a utopia. As Solana can make up for Ethereum's short coming's right now and vice-versa, applications that prefer speed, like trading, can use Solana for higher performance when required.\n\n**Solana actually serves a unique purpose in an Ethereum dominated world while many current blockchains will not have a legitimate unique purpose.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nrreen/ethereum_vs_solana_design_philosophy/,1,3
nrrvtg,1622765357,"Ethereum, NFTs and Gaming","I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen enough light being shone on how Ethereum is about to reshape the entire gaming scene in terms of loot/rewards. I have played numerous multiplayer games where you own items whether they are appearance altering, stat altering or just cosmetic. But very few have a fully functioning marketplace where you can actually sell your items for real life money or sometimes even trade with other players at all. NFTs are now paving the way for the new wave of games to bring this to the masses and even though I am an avid gamer I only found this out recently, I have even seen speculation (and it really is speculation) that GTA 6 could provide in game rewards in the form of cryptocurrency, I want to make it clear that if that did happen even if other mainstream games didn‚Äôt follow suit it really would be one of the biggest steps towards mainstream adoption that we would‚Äôve seen in a very long time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nrrvtg/ethereum_nfts_and_gaming/,1,21
