Could this be caused by bad internet or are there other possible issues? I'm located in Pennsylvania and I'm running on the Us East server so I'm just confused why all of a sudden my current hashrate went from very stable with a deviation of +- 50Mh/s at most to nearly 150 on a very deviating graph.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1nan9y1y8f61.png?width=1320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91cbf60464ba969575566cd93da220aaa1635b17",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lblfpf/hasrate_question/,2,0

lbn8pq,1612358024,1559: 12M gas worth of users?,"I've been reading the 1559 thread on eth magicians, and this one particular point I don't understand. \n\nmdalembert guy is asking 1559-proponent MicahZoltu to quantify the useability improvement. What exactly is being targeted with this proposal.\n\nhttps://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1559-fee-market-change-for-eth-1-0-chain/2783/260\n\nSo what is 12M gas worth of users?\n\nBecause the discussion in that thread points that 1559 is only geared towards those users, and that the wider userbase as a whole is not expected to generally see any ux improvements.\n\nIs the 12M representing the top gas users? AKA yield farmers and hardcore defi trading algorithms?\n\nI'd recommend people read that thread on eth magicians (about the last 3 weeks). It paints a completely different picture of what 1559 aims to do then what's being marketed online.
