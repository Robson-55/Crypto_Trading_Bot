lxsvq9,1614885877,Looking for Developer Feedback,"Hi r/ethereum, hope your day is going swell.\n\nI'm a lawyer whose been involved in a non-technical way for a few years. I'm non-technical, but I teach a Bitcoin/Crypto course to lawyers and professionals and have developed a bit of a practice manual for dealing with the additional complexities of clients who hold crypto of one sort or another.\n\nThis experience has led me to believe that there are a number of areas in the legal space that could be massively streamlined and would benefit from decentralization. There are actually areas where lawyers may even be able to be largely removed from the process.\n\nI've focused on one of these and have drawn up how such a contract system and network could work. I'm trying to weigh the viability of such a project but don't have a rolodex of Ethereum developers who I can bounce ideas off of. If there is a viable project, I'm going to need to find some technical partners to team up with to start a build.\n\nIs there a good forum or community where I can track these sorts of connections down and connect with some experienced developers?\n\nAnywhere you can point me to, I'd be very appreciative.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lxsvq9/looking_for_developer_feedback/,6,9

lxuner,1614890315,"March Mod Announcements üì£ Note on NFT Art Posts, Active / New Mods, Resource List","Hey everyone üëã welcome to March! Here are a few housekeeping items that I will combine into a single post.\n\n# Note on NFT Art Posts\n\nThere's been a **ton** of excitement around NFTs on Ethereum lately. NFT stands for ""Non-Fungible Token"" - aka a digital object with provenance (who owned it when), and markets built into it, all enabled by the Ethereum blockchain. While the concept has been around for a few years, they've really started taking off in USD terms and public awareness. Learn more about NFTs here:  \n\n\n* [The Non-Fungible Token Bible](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) (by OpenSea) \n* [Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT): Beginner's Guide](https://decrypt.co/resources/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-explained-guide-learn-blockchain) (Decrypt Media)  \n\n\nWhile we are very happy to see artists exploring new forms of ownership and patronage, the r/ethereum frontpage has become very full of artists sharing their work. Therefore, we've decided to start removing NFT art posts in order to keep r/ethereum as a tech and protocol focused space. Discussion on NFTs and their place in the Ethereum economy, or news from NFT companies, will still be permitted. A few places you can check out to post your work:  \n\n\n* r/NFT is a great place to share your work and connect with other creators\n* many of the NFT marketplaces have lively community discords ([Zora](https://discord.com/invite/Va58aMrcwk), [OpenSea](https://discord.gg/qXYcsp663u), [Nifty Gateway](https://discord.com/invite/vjFVZTx), many others)\n\n# Active / New Mods\n\nr/ethereum continues to grow daily - we recently crossed **700k members**! We're doing our best to improve the quality of the sub every day.   \n\n\nActive mods include u/Evanvanness u/Twigwam  u/ligi u/edmundedgar u/vbuterin u/jbschweitzer u/souptacular . We've also added two new mods recently: u/trent_vanepps (me!) and u/always_question  \n\n\nIf there's anything spammy or scammy, please reach out! We're always open for other suggestions on how to improve the sub, so drop us a DM.\n\n# Resource List\n\n[High Gas Prices ‚õΩ Info &amp; Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lt8xgw/high_gas_prices_info_resources/)  \n[EIP-1559 Expected Benefits, Possible Challenges, Misconceptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lnp5jh/eip1559_expected_benefits_possible_challenges/)  \n\n\nThanks everyone for participating here!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lxuner/march_mod_announcements_note_on_nft_art_posts/,31,77
