lmz0k6,1613686845,"I've thought a lot about defi on a fundamental level, these are my thoughts:","Money is supposed to be a stable placeholder for wealth. Wealth is not a numeric value, it's an abstract concept of goods and services.  Wealth creation is turning a tree into a picnic table, hiring someone to fix your car, knitting a sweater. Increasing money doesn't mean you have more wealth, just ask Venezuela about that.\n\nInvesting in stocks creates is a type of borrowing that actually creates wealth, because you are lending your wealth out to a company who uses your wealth to create more wealth. By buying Apple stock, I am giving them money (place holder wealth) to build factories so they can create phones (wealth). \n\n Defi does not create wealth as cryptocurrencies are a zero sum game.  Borrowing and lending isn't wealth generation, it's just sloshing the same wealth around between platforms and wallets.  You can farm inflation of an asset, but that isn't wealth generation either, that's just devaluing an asset by increasing the supply. \n\nDefi has created this interconnected economy that heavily relies on each other, and when new wealth enters in one asset it will likely trickle down into them all. Conversely, when wealth starts to disappear, you would create a liquidity crisis so violent that would make the great depression blush.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis current defi ecosystem will not replace the traditional system because its  lack of wealth generation makes it too fragile for a liquidity crisis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lmz0k6/ive_thought_a_lot_about_defi_on_a_fundamental/,1,11
