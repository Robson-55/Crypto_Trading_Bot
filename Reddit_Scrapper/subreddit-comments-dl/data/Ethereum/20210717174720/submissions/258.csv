khaj86,1608526823,Is Ethereum similar to Open Source Apps? How would this work with a currency?,"I can download open source apps for my phone and my computer. Something I've realized is that many of my favorite apps are usually open source and free.\n\nWhich makes me think about a future in which we have a currency (or at least access to) that is decentralized and open source. \n\nJust wondering if it's the same/similar. Is this the future of the internet and in 5-10 years people will look back and know it's true, and if so how would a currency (ETH) work with all of this?\n\nWhy would there need to be a currency (like ETH) in the first place or is the entire argument about having a currency that is decentralized and that's it?\n\nI'm really interested in investing in ETH, but I'm not fully convinced yet. I want to be certain that is the future and is better than what we currently have on several fronts.\n\nThanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/khaj86/is_ethereum_similar_to_open_source_apps_how_would/,1,3
