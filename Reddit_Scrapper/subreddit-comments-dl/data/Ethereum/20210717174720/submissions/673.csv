nd63e9,1621105634,"I’ve done something really stupid, any advice on how I can recover my BEP20 ETH?","So I wanted to buy some NFTs (i think they’re useless but i was really bored) so I opened a Trust Wallet to use with OpenSea. I bought 100₺ (about $11) worth of ETH on Binance, then I proceeded to send the ETH using the BEP20 network to my Binance-Peg Ethereum wallet.\n\nI, for some reason, didn’t realize that I can’t just magically convert that to ERC20 ETH. \n\nNow I can’t even send the funds in my wallet back to the exchange because I need BNB to pay for the transaction fee, and I can’t just send BNB to the wallet because the minimum amount of BNB I can withdraw is already twice as much the money I got stuck in the wallet. It just wouldn’t be worth it.\n\nI wanted to ask if there’s any other way I can get the funds off that wallet, I know it’s not a huge amount of money but it feels really irritating to have it just stuck there. And I don’t wanna give up before I know for sure that there’s nothing I can do about it.\n\nThank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nd63e9/ive_done_something_really_stupid_any_advice_on/,1,7
nd685k,1621106006,Is it just me or should Elon stay away from ETH?,"Strictly opinion here but I hope he stays far away from ETH. Sure we would get an initial huge pump, but Elon has a history of screwing everyone over. I could see him buying some ETH, then getting bored with it and saying “meh, gas fees are not efficient enough. I’m switching to another shiny new coin”. \n\nOur momentum this bull run was doing just fine without Elon. I think we would be up close to 5k if it weren’t for his latest tweet that dumped the entire market. He said he’s looking at other crypto and I sure hope he doesn’t get into ethereum. He needs to shut up and leave crypto alone.\n\nWe all had high hopes when Elon entered the game back in February, thinking he would bring institutional adoption and bring legitimacy to the space. Instead he did the exact opposite and basically turned crypto into a total joke with Dogecoin. It’s just shits and giggles for him to prove he’s so powerful he can take a meme coin and people will buy it. It’s all just a power trip to soothe his megalomaniac ego. \n\nYou talk to friends and colleagues to explain ethereum to them now and they’re just like “hey what about doggy coins?”. \n\nHe doesn’t care if he hurts an entire market that people believe in and have invested a lot of time and money into.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nd685k)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nd685k/is_it_just_me_or_should_elon_stay_away_from_eth/,1,236
