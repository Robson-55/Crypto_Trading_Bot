np7zhv,1622480289,We Made a DeFi DApp - Open Beta on the Ropsten Testnet!,"Hello r/ethereum!\n\nWe are Nick and Chris, two long-term ETH HODLers and software developers who want to help build useful DeFi DApps. That's why we created [https://diffex.io](https://diffex.io), a smart contract DApp that allows you to write, sell, buy, and execute options contracts for ERC20 tokens. Currently, we have launched a beta version of the Dapp on the Ropsten testnet that you can try without using any real ETH or ERC20 tokens. For this beta version, we created a free ERC20 token called DFTX (DiffEx Test) that can be used as the underlying asset for calls and puts. To get some, join our discord server: [https://discord.gg/fZksGrs89W](https://discord.gg/fZksGrs89W) or telegram: [https://t.me/diffexio](https://t.me/diffexio). If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them here or on the r/diffexio subreddit! \n\nTake a look at our whitepaper:\n\n[https://diffex.io/whitepaper.pdf](https://diffex.io/whitepaper.pdf)\n\nTo use the DApp, activate MetaMask and head to:\n\n[https://diffex.io/dashboard/](https://diffex.io/dashboard/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/np7zhv/we_made_a_defi_dapp_open_beta_on_the_ropsten/,4,2
