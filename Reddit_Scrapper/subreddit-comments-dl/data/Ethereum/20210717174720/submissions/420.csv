I’ve been fascinated with ethereum, the ecosystem, and all around learning about the possibilities of decentralized finance. However, as someone not very well versed on economics (I know the basics, but that’s about it) - where would I go to read about the impacts on the current financial system &amp; the problems that they’re trying to solve, and how they aim to solve them, from a global perspective? Also, are there any problems that aren’t being addressed with eth? I’m looking for something more in-depth, if possible.\n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lrc36i/learning_about_the_economics_of_the_problem_that/,68,66

Everyone tells me ETH is a safer then most crypto and has  long term  potential massive gains, Google the price target and I think it’s like $8k or some shit. Obviously, that’s very appealing as I don’t mind buying a few coins and walking away for a year. Scrolling through these posts it seems like buying ethereum is the opposite of what I should be doing and that’s fake news, maybe I’m wrong.
