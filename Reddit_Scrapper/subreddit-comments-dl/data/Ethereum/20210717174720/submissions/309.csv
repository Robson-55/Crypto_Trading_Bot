kycb89,1610772808,A full explanation why ether is NOTHING like oil or gas,"Let‚Äôs say I have a car with a 14-gallon fuel tank and I want to take it on a road trip. The car is not aware of the price of gasoline, and it would not travel any farther if the price of gas would double the next day. That‚Äôs because the intrinsic utility of oil has nothing to do with its monetary value. The car needs gas because of its particular physical properties and how the ICE is designed to utilize it. If I want to drive from point A to point B and it takes a full tank to get there, it will take that full tank no matter what happens to the monetary properties of gas/oil. This is fundamentally different from how Ethereum uses ether. \n\nEthereum (the network) is not trying to be money, but it utilizes ether exclusively for its monetary properties and not because it can be magically burned by an imaginary engine of sorts. It costs money to participate in the network as a miner, and their engagement is financially incentivized with ether. Block space is a scarce resource, therefore participants who wish to transact use ether to bid for it. These interactions are utilizing ether as a monetary medium of exchange. When the price of ether goes up, the ether denomination of gas prices go down. That happens because no one is using ether as gas/oil, and it is actually being used as money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kycb89/a_full_explanation_why_ether_is_nothing_like_oil/,1,41

kykngf,1610810233,Staking rewards now vs later,I've seen that if you start validating now or if you commit funds to start early you can should expect increased ROI from staking that lasts forever.

I think ~5% ROI if I were to wait until later on is what I remember. \nCan someone give me a quick rundown on this? How long do we have to secure the higher rate of ETH rewards?
