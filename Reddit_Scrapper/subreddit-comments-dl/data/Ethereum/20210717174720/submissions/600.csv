n4853w,1620077984,Crypto for the homeless - 5/3/21 pizza trip - also some info for newcomers," \n\nThis post is mainly for new people who don't know about my project but basically I am the guy running crypto for the homeless\n\n[http://cryptoforthehomeless.org](http://cryptoforthehomeless.org/) (main site)\n\n[http://cryptohomeless.home.blog](http://cryptohomeless.home.blog/) (blog site)\n\nTo give a gist of what we are about: we deliver food to the homeless using funds from crypto crowdsourcing.\n\nPictures from earlier today:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/G8tSzQ5.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/G8tSzQ5.jpg) \- homeless person #1\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/IJZKFO0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IJZKFO0.jpg) \- homeless person #2\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/3wHdlrx.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3wHdlrx.jpg) \- homeless person #3\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/2yuG0m9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/2yuG0m9.jpg) \- homeless person #4\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/nURvMTs.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/nURvMTs.jpg) (pizza w/ the flyers)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/l0nwLdT.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/l0nwLdT.jpg) (receipt)\n\nI already know that there are a decent amount of people that do not like the fact that these people are getting photographed because they believe it is for humiliation. That isn't the point of the photos at all. One huge obstacle we ran into time and time again is that the skeptics of the internet DEMAND PROOF of everything we do otherwise it basically didn't happen. I believe one quick picture is a good compromise.\n\nI've been trying hard to learn about up and coming projects to the best of my ability and added 11 total cryptos we currently are accepting (many more to come - specifically Defi tokens).\n\nThings like gas/toll/labor is absolutely not compensated - the money is going directly into food (and or clothes/goods for the homeless ). As a result, it is not super easy to get volunteers to help with the project (we have had volunteers from all over the world - just not consistently). For the most part, I personally have done most of the trips out to hand out food. Finding the homeless people to hand the food to in itself is quite a task, especially in a big city where you don't have the convenience of just parking anywhere. I am looking for more volunteers! You just have to go out and buy/hand out food and document it exactly like I did above, and you will be reimbursed.\n\nThanks to all of the communities that have shown interest in helping out/be supportive. We are 2+ years strong now!\n\nOur current donation addresses:\n\n**BTC:** 3Cdp95cJ2gWTfoH7ydszwxRztPRWgJhxJT  \n**BCH:** qr0g850dfthha5v2fatmfvvmkz2nmwjqpgnfz0kywr  \n**DOGE:** DDBHNdxmdZ2QXfDBdY1nC7CTUw4y1kz1uf  \n**LTC:** MM26USuiX7WUkD1EaV3peKVdsvM7YrDFFJ  \n**ZEC:** t1PGRsvYRCYC3u7WF3GcfgmCaUNnFFwcF6V  \n**ETH:** 0xdb50c8e8a69d7baa3abab95107db1d315c84a8ca  \n**MONERO:** 447u6QpZgrUN6H4s3vsZ9mRfJ88ZMmEsWKxToNuUYe5DcgKsRjZyK49N7y3A6McE9MaEyX4y5bd7yPfLgWcvAatPKGr51Vm  \n**GARLICOIN:** grlc1q9wr4de97405genpp3g4vw62ete4nl05ju47pfg  \n**BANANO**  \nban\_3huffb6oj7uppkxu6su9fii943w61gf4cmyzc9tex6izrf6xqaopwdiiib9b  \n**CARDANO**  \naddr1q858uwjjvhuxtph6nce9s3v4d4gq32sqczlme2evxgguwd0g0ca9ye0cvkr0483jtpze2m2spz4qps9lhj4jcvs3cu6s9cf6ep  \n**NANO**  \nnano\_3p64ab97w1ma4p4nsssw15foc1kmhxufe64hcra63xdwew4sh9ofmfhn9unr  \n**SOLANA/KIN**  \n5KeA65ywRUwpJHqhvjNzTyHQ7ugFrvgRKdJfwWv7pdLp  \n**VECHAIN**  \n0xD6e91165AE22189740B18ba0db6f8CE707501203  \n**TRTL coin**  \nTRTLuy56S5G81BNJfwqR8EdxDmgCiAhuxP2jDVDYXAX5bHFzwa5xNeTSMzgcrDmnkdBZgnbFSPwRa1RXHh9d1PSTapighMrAjLP\n\nKin address if you're sending from mykinwallet: 6RrwWcmotzKa6jTKhXaKaTuduBv62sdvEm9SbHcAW14s",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n4853w/crypto_for_the_homeless_5321_pizza_trip_also_some/,1,1

n4935s,1620080500,Playing games now feels expensive and wasteful,"Forgive me, been wanting to get this brag off my chest: \n\nI got some tax refund money around fall last year and decided to upgrade to an rtx 3080 pc and 3070 laptop (gp66 leopard @130 watts-solid!). The pc was a prebuilt and kind of an insane deal looking back at it, $1600 us, and I bought on columbus (that should not be a celebrated holiday but whatever....) day for 5% off. As someone with **very** little money to spare, I felt like some kind of genius oracle blessed by the gods for getting my pc when I did.\n\nAnyway, I used my pc for actual gaming for a few months before I thought I'd give this ""mining"" thing a try for myself to see what I make of it.\n\nAnd now that I have, it just feels like entirely too much money to squander by actually using my two machines for gaming. Even on my laptop, a 12 hour gaming session (modest for an overachiever like me) now costs me $5 in lost passive income. Double that if I want to use the pc.\n\nI have a severe, but thankfully curable, medical condition right now so I can't bring in any money with work. Thanks to ethereum mining, unless this coin goes totally tits up when they turn mining off, I will be able to afford a really nice 4k gaming tv and a surface pro 8 in the fall. Otherwise I would have absolutely no possibility of affording either of those things without my health situation doing a total 180.\n\nThe 3080 pc alone would never have happened for me if not for the tax refund. I feel so lucky to have a really good card, especially at a time when they are basically unobtainium.\n\nSo it just feels weirdly difficult to justify gaming right now. I have never experienced this before. In order to be less bored, I actually need a cheap machine that is too weak to be tempting to mine on*. $5/day may not sound like much, but it adds up. And when that is your whole luxury budget it feels like a lot to give up. It definitely affects my enjoyment of gaming at the moment, and I'm going to feel kind of relieved when mining goes away.\n\nAnyone else feel conflicted about doing actual gaming with their gpus?\n\nI almost don't want to ask this, but when you can't farm ETH anymore, what are your plans?\n\n\* I used the last of my spending cash to back the Aya Neo windows handheld so starting next month I will be able to play some games at least without eating into my income.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n4935s/playing_games_now_feels_expensive_and_wasteful/,1,6
