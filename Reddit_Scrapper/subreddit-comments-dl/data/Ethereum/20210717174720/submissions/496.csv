mj5poa,1617444487,Why not do the docking instead of EIP1559,"From what I’ve heard it’s planned to dock mainnet with ETH2 earlier than expected, but still only in a year or so. Why are they doing EIP1559 before that, keeping the risk of miners opposing it? \n\nIt should be possible to dock rather soon, right?\nEven if it was 1-2 months later than the planned EIP1559 hard fork date, it would reduce all the debates and just get rid of PoW quickly.\nSo why are we still waiting to do the docking? Is it so hard to complete technically?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mj5poa/why_not_do_the_docking_instead_of_eip1559/,1,19
mj622t,1617446106,Interesting project in 2021 - A review,"I stumbled across the project StudentCoin. Seems to be the biggest ICO 2021. It reminds me of 2017.\n\n\nThe project is unique in the crypto space and if it starts to get more attention it can become a very popular coin.\n\n\nIn two weeks they just launched their wallet, mobile app and announced 3 exchange listings.\n\n\nThe team confirmed that STC is going to be listed on 9 new exchanges from the top 50 (a few from them are top 20 and top 10) from May 2021.\n\n\nTheir presale is currently live and 106 of 150 phases are finished.\n\n\nA review is nothing without negative points and criticisms:\n\n  - Communication of the team could be improved\n\n  - There is a lot of FUD.. The team could just clear this up better and comment on all the criticisms. To improve that they are planning to make a team interview series from next week to be closer to the community.\n\n  - The 500 universities are not all real partners.. they just have students from those universities as supporter.. its not clear which universities are partners\n\n\nThe ico price is still really low with 0.017 USD.\n\n\nA small portion of the circulating supply is beeing traded on Uniswap for 0.026 USD already.\n\n\nStudentCoin is already on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/\n\n\nStudentCoin Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/studentcoinorg\n\n\nThere are three options to participate:\n\n  - buy STC via Credit Card\n\n  - send ETH from your MetaMask wallet\n\n  - send any crypto to the Coinbase Commerce payment method\n\n\nI just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay the package.\n\n\nI recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.\n\n\nCoinbase Commerce works also for US investors.\n\n\nUse this bonus code to get 5% more at the purchase.\n\n\nCODE: Sxlb8setj7\n\n\nOr the link: https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sxlb8setj7\n\n\nI would appreciate if you support me :)\n\n\n* this is not a financial advice. Do your own research and only invest what you can afford to loose.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mj622t/interesting_project_in_2021_a_review/,1,7

I'd like to understand the risks involved. \n\nI think I've understood there to be a risk of signing something that is a cleverly composed transaction, allowing the attacker to steal funds. Is this correct? How do you identify it?\n\nI've at least seen these types of signing:\n* what appears to be base64\n* what appears to be JSON\n* what appears to be byte data\n\nHow can I feel safe, and what risks am I facing?

mj9vf4,1617461104,We're unlocking the true power of NFTs. Influence is a space strategy MMO incorporating Parallel's NFT game assets into our game.,"Within the NFT space right now, you can find almost an infinite number of artists creating amazing works and selling them as NFTs. This is an exciting new space currently being explored, but what are the true powers of NFTs?\n\nNFTs are a hot new buzzword, everyone has heard it by now, but most (even in the crypto space) are still wrapping their heads around what they are and how they can be utilized. Not to say that selling art as an NFT is a bad thing, but NFTs are vastly more powerful than this, and the depth in which they can be utilized is just beginning to be showcased.\n\nI work for an Ethereum blockchain gaming company, releasing the title [Influence,](https://www.influenceth.io/) where in-game assets are composed of NFTs. This gives players actual unique ownership over the content they acquire while playing Influence. We think that this adds a layer of depth on top of the existing utilization most know. However, even this is just the beginning!\n\nNFTs, once minted on the blockchain, can be tracked, and utilized by anyone, while the owner still maintains custody and rights to it. This opens doors to platforms like Influence to support other game assets within their game.\n\nWe announced earlier this week that we would be incorporating another game’s assets into our game. Parallel is a card game that just released their Alpha set of cards, and we loved how well their content would work in our game. So we reached out to the team and asked if they would be okay if we utilized some of their NFTs as pieces to our game. I should mention this does not take permission and is another benefit of the Ethereum blockchain, but we wanted to ensure a solid relationship with the incredible Parallel team.\n\nSo maybe you are asking yourself, “so what if you are utilizing another game’s content in your game, what does that mean for me?”\n\nGreat question! It means that the content you either acquire or purchase within one game can now cross over into other games. Imagine playing EVE Online or World of Warcraft and collecting every piece of gear possible, and you want to stop playing these games and try something new. With the cross-functionality of assets being supported in multiple games, it opens up the ability to immediately utilize what you earned in one game into the new game.\n\nThis creates an entire ecosystem that supports each other, and instead of game companies trying to steal players into their game, they can help promote each other and ensure the content is what players want. It is a symbiotic relationship that over time will benefit all parties involved, especially the players.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post and want to follow us before our launch on April 17th, join the discord, or get on our email list. Early adopters will receive some amazing perks!\n\nCheers,\n\n[Website](https://www.influenceth.io/)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pEeBHF8WsK)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mj9vf4/were_unlocking_the_true_power_of_nfts_influence/,1,14
