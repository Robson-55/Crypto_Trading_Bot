It is only a small amount  (&lt;$100)  and I am reading stories about relatively huge costs, especially for lower amounts. \n\nShould I transfer and if so, what kind of gas fee can I expect? Or should I just let the ETH sit in the original exchange for the foreseeable future?\n\nI couldn't find an answer in other posts. Hopefully someone can help me understand.

lfklyi,1612815130,"To all the newcomers in this space, welcome!","Whether you entered the crypto world during the Gamestop saga, or when Elon Musk tweeted about Doge, or when Tesla invested 1.5 billion dollars in Bitcoin, welcome.\n\nAvoid FUD and FOMO like the bloody plague. Do your own due diligence, do not follow the hype and educate yourself on the movement as a whole, rather than how to make as much money as possible, the shortest period of time conceivable. \n\nStart by only investing what you can afford to lose. Choose an exchange that is trusted (there are many nightmare stories to be shared from those who have been here for years). Binance ([https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=JN2IBGLC](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=JN2IBGLC)) is the largest crypto exchange out there and is probably the most trusted.\n\nDo not tell people how much you have invested. That information is on a need to know basis and they do not need to know, nor does anyone on some online forum. If you share too much, you will be targeted by certain individuals with nefarious intentions. A sensible level of caution is advised when operating in the crypto world. Keep your wits about you.\n\nFinally, never ever be put off by obnoxious know it alls - ASK! ASK! ASK! It does not matter how silly you may feel your question is, you will find an army of open and generous people here who are more than willing to take the time to explain anything and everything to you.\n\nBe blessed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lfklyi/to_all_the_newcomers_in_this_space_welcome/,1,56
