mqz0er,1618431300,"I can only see 1 of 2 transactions, and it's been pending forever. I'm confused. Please help!","Hello ETH Friends!\n\nThis morning, I tried sending some BAT from Ledger Live to Coinbase Pro. After submitting the transaction ***with the lowest possible gas fees***, I closed out of the screen and went on with my day.\n\nAfter two hours, I noticed that the transaction had not settled, and *I did not see any history of the transaction taking place in my Ledger Live ""Operations"" section*. Also, my ETH balance did not change, so I figured there must have been a transaction error on Ledger Live.\n\nThen, **I sent some more BAT from Ledger Live to Coinbase Pro**. I still don't see any ETH removed from my ledger wallet, but I can click on my wallet address and see that there is **1** pending transaction (I can't find any history of the first transaction).\n\nSo, my two questions are these:\n\n1. Did my second transaction cancel my first? Why do I only see **1** pending transaction instead of 2?\n2. It's been over 7 hours, and I still have no idea if/when this transaction will complete. Is this normal? Does anyone recommend that I take further action? Maybe contact Ledger support?\n\nThanks,",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mqz0er/i_can_only_see_1_of_2_transactions_and_its_been/,1,1

mr2ymc,1618443612,Question about staking ETH on exchanges,"Hi there,\n\nFairly new to the crypto scene and have been looking at different exchanges to stake some of my ETH (Binance, Kraken etc) and saw that on Binance you can both stake your ETH for the tokenised BETH at a 1:1 ratio or you can directly trade your ETH for BETH at a ratio of about 0.95:1 at the time of writing. \n\nMy question is would I need to go through the staking page on the website in order to be able to earn the rewards from BETH, or can I also earn rewards on the higher amount of BETH that I could have exchanged my ETH for just by directly trading it on the spot market. \n\nJust seems like a bit of a loophole so thought I must be missing something!! \n\nAlso any other tips or recommendations about staking ETH is appreciated :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mr2ymc/question_about_staking_eth_on_exchanges/,1,6
