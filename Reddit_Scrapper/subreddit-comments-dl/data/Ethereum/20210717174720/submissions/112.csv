iaxv5k,1597603493,Staking / Cold Storage w/ Ethereum,"Hi,  \n\n\nNew to Ethereum. Long-time Cardano holder. Actively respect and support both projects.  \n\n\nWith Cardano, I can download the wallet, delegate ADA to a stakepool, then turn off the computer / wifi and just leave it locked in a safe for years. I'll still be able to stake and accumulate more ADA in the meantime despite the computer &amp; wallet being turned off and not connected to WiFi.   \n\n\nIs there a similar process I can do with Ethereum? If so, how would I accomplish that?  \n\n\nThank you for your help and advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/iaxv5k/staking_cold_storage_w_ethereum/,1,1
