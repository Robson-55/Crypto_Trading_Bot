Are companies building for web first because they have more web than mobile visitors, or is it simply them being scrappy and focusing more on building a product than on building a mobile-friendly product?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mn1e7n/what_percentage_of_your_traffic_is_mobile_should/,1,3
