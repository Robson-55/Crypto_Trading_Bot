nibfem,1621660668,It does not matter how high or low the price is.,Dips don‚Äôt matter Highs don‚Äôt matter. All that matters is that we get away from the traditional financial system. The get rich quick mentality draws in the wrong people. \n\nWhat I‚Äôm getting at is the reason why eth and some other cryptos are valuable is not because of their price potential. It is the potential to revolutionize the financial sector eventually every other aspect of the world.\nThe reason why I hold is because I trust ETH and see the revolution ahead and being part of the revolution is reason enough. \n\nAnother reason why I don‚Äôt sell my crypto in general and take profits is because I don‚Äôt trust fiat enough. For my value to be stored  in a government asset that are performing a rug-pull on us seems riskier. \nAll I need to know is that in a year from now 1 eth will equal 1eth and no government can take that away. \n\nWhat I should ad: don‚Äôt invest money you don‚Äôt have for some moonshot dream. Create a portfolio and don‚Äôt touch it. If you do that it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs the peak of the bull run or is just starting. The rich don‚Äôt sell their assets they keep them forever and borrow against it.\n\nJust a random thought I had.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nibfem/it_does_not_matter_how_high_or_low_the_price_is/,1,1

nicsfp,1621666552,Eip 1559 - why burn? Why not just not have a base fee?,"I get that 1559 will potentially make ether deflationary and that's a good thing for investors.\n\nHowever, i would argue that ethereum being used for actual day to day transactions would add a lot more value than just making coin owners richer. To do that you're going to need to make transactions free or almost free.\n\nTherefore if that's the case, why charge a base fee at all if it just gets burnt and doesn't provide an incentive to miners? Not having a base fee would essentially make transactions free except for the network contested cases where you need to provide a tip to the miner.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nicsfp/eip_1559_why_burn_why_not_just_not_have_a_base_fee/,1,32

nih47w,1621684903,How to get FREE PIZZA TODAY on Bitcoin Pizza Day,"[Twitter going brrrr with free pizza!](https://twitter.com/search?q=rarepizzas&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live)\n\nToday is a sacred day in the cryptocurrency space. On May 22, 2010 Laszlo Hanyecz made the first ever Bitcoin transaction, trading 10,000 bitcoin for two large pizzas. Today, crypto enthusiasts celebrate this milestone occasion by sharing some slices of pizza.\n\nHow to get some FREE PIZZA TODAY:\n\n* Check our [Rarepizzas CRM](http://crm.rarepizzas.com/) to see if you have a pizzeria nearby that was onboarded, in the Pizzeria Tracker tab. We gave to each of these pizzerias $500 worth of pizza to give away to their communities, with an additional $150 tip for their work.\n* If you live in the USA you can use [Slice](http://slicelife.com) to get a fresh pie delivered by entering the code FREEPIZZADAY. We bought 1 bitcoin worth of pizza redeemable through Slice‚Äôs network of 16,000 pizza shops.\n* We also partnered with [Bitcoin Pizza](https://www.eatbitcoinpizza.com/) so you can get a fresh pie for free while supporting the Human Rights Foundation's Bitcoin Development Fund. We are giving away 1000 bitcoin pizzas! Stay tuned for the announcement!\n* Order your pizza, snap a picture and post it on #Twitter [and send us a receipt](http://pizzaproof.com/).\n\nMore about Rarepizzas:\n\n* On March 14, 2021 (Pi Day) we sold digital collectible Rare Pizzas Box NFTs that will open to reveal a unique, generated pie on June 28. So far, we‚Äôve raised over $1M USD which will go to buying the world pizza, with a portion going to the artists and contributors who helped coordinate this momentous project. Collectors can get a box by visiting [Rarepizzas Store](https://www.rarepizzas.com/store) or [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/rare-pizzas-box), there will only be 10,000 of these made and they are sold on a bonding curve.\n* All this free pizza is possible thanks to PizzaDAO and the efforts of a community with 100+ members and the collaboration of 300+ artists that participated in the Rare Pizzas generative art project.\n* We also donated over $30,000 USD to charities across the world to throw local pizza parties. This includes feeding hundreds of kids and elderly households across the world.\n* Why are you doing this? We believe that pizza should be free, or at least once a year. We want to celebrate a world wide party every year in which pizza is free, for Laszlo! And we want to do it with mainstream adoption!\n\nWelcome to the party!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nih47w/how_to_get_free_pizza_today_on_bitcoin_pizza_day/,1,150
