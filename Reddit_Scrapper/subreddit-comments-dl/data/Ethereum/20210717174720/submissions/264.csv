kjzsu6,1608906355,How is the price of ETH tied to ethereum features?,"I can see XRP's price dropped from news of the SEC lawsuit, since XRP owns 60% of their tokens, but in the case of ether, chainlink (or dogecoin for that matter), each of their ""parent"" organizations do different things, but aren't their currencies ultimately measured across the same set of metrics (e.g. circulating supply, max supply, transactions / sec, block time, etc.). So how does whether their parent organization provides smart contracts to external APIs or files for bankruptcy protection affect price performance?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kjzsu6/how_is_the_price_of_eth_tied_to_ethereum_features/,1,16

kk46iq,1608923170,Will Ethereum outlast the competition?,"Hey everyone, fairly new to the cryptocurrency scene, so would appreciate some guidance. It would appear that Ethereum does have several advantages over Bitcoin, making it especially attractive to big business and investors alike. That much is clear. However, Bitcoin is still leading to the race, and by a fairly huge margin (if one could even call it that). Obviously, not one can predict what the future holds, but given Ethereum's utility, can't one be assured that it will eventually catch up?  \n\n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kk46iq/will_ethereum_outlast_the_competition/,1,65

I use two exchanges. Binance and Coinbase. Binance for alt coins I don’t plan to hold an insanely long time, and Coinbase for BTC/ETH. I’ve considered using a hot wallet but this leaves me to difficulties selling quickly if I want to. \n\nI’ve ready Coinbase keeps 98 percent of crypto on cold storage, and Binance around the same. Obviously someone could get my password, but it at least alleviates responsibility of holding it on my phone. \n\nCan anyone legitimately talk me out of it outside of “not your keys?” I’m doing long term investing and I’m not looking to see it as just having currency, but as a means of building worth in USD.

kk6mws,1608932861,Which ERC should I choose to implement USDT payments for my website?,"Hello there,\n\nI'm new to Ethereum but need to implement some serious production-ready smart contract.\n\nThe idea is to accept USDT (ERC20) tokens on my website. As I know, crypto exchanges are generating a unique address for every customer and then they can identify how much each of them has deposited to the store. But in my case, I need to forward that money to my own wallet but can't do it without a gas which users don't send to the generated wallet. Of course, I can send to these wallets some gas and then initiate tokens transfer back to my main wallet but I guess this is not the canonical way.\n\nPlease help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kk6mws/which_erc_should_i_choose_to_implement_usdt/,1,2
