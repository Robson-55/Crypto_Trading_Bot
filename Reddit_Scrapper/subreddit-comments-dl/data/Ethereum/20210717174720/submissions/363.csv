lcse2v,1612478575,New to Ethereum (about 2 months) and looking for a wallet,"I’m ideally looking for one on a mobile device (iOS) and after searching and reading many posts I’ve narrowed it down to MetaMask or Argent. I just want to be sure of my final choice. \n\nThey both look really good, and I’m leaning towards MetaMask as there seems to be a lot of enthusiasm in the community here. \n\nDoes having a browser built in to MetaMask make it any less secure? (Hope this isn’t a silly question). \n\nOut of the two is it possible to say one is more secure than the other, without having to choose one a novice may find complicated?\n\nI’m hoping to get a good temperature read of what you all think of both of them. Being user-friendly is also another perk I’m looking for. And whilst I’m concerned about gas prices (still learning what they are) I’m not sure if I should be concerned about this too much. \n\nAnyways please feel free to let me know, and add any relevant info aside from the points I’ve mentioned. \n\nThanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lcse2v/new_to_ethereum_about_2_months_and_looking_for_a/,1,7

Does the logic difficulty cause the gas price to go up, if so how does someone know how much gas to charge before executing complex logic?\n\nI’m sure my questions are riddled with fundamental misunderstandings and I really appreciate the help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lf0dx5/newb_questions_about_eth_transactional_logic/,1,8
