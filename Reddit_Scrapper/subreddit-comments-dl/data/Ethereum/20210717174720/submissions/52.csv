hh8gko,1593319330,How to deal with an Ethereum investor who thinks he's my wife?,"Hey so welcome. I'm having some trouble getting one of the biggest Ethereum investors to pay me for my work. \n\nBasically, one of ethereum's biggest investors has been profitting millions off my work without paying me. His name is Fred Ehrsam over at paradigm capital. I think it's EXTREMELEY relevant to Ethereum because he's investing my money all across the space, and i worry every night that other innocent people will be ripped off by him.\n\nI met Fred shortly after he left Coinbase. I had taken a year off from medical school to seek funding for a very proftiable crypto trading algorithm. I knew that if i could get funding for the trading algorithm, then i could use the profits to develop a blockchain-based clinical treatment platform, and in turn treat more patients than i would otherwise as a doctor. Although i was making a very high percentage per day doing this trading strategy, i didn't have enough base capital to completely cover withdrawal fees from more than two exchanges. After examining graphs and other materials i prepared for him, Fred encouraged me to fully drop out of medical school to start a hedge fund with him. Together we came up with the name Paradigm Capital along with about 48 other hedge fund names. So, after that, I worked extremely hard to expand the algorithm from two to five exchanges...\n\nAt one point I was literally living out of my car in a Walmart parking lot to keep as much money in my trading algorithm as possible, because Fred kept saying he was going to send money to help see if it would scale to 5 exchanges. This guy had a net worth of $21 million at the time i believe. But he never wound up sending the money but kept promising he would. So after a lot more work I expanded the algo to 5 exchanges doing my part.\n\nAfter a few months of expanding the algorithm i stayed at Fred's for a second time a few months later, where he asked me to shower in his room and I then introduced him to a girl i was into, but then he changed gears and told me that i didn't have enough social awareness to start a hedge fund with him. I pretty much knew right then that Fred had stolen or was going to steal my algorithm. But I didn't have enough proof until this [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2020/02/14/crypto-heavyweights-coinbase-polychain-and-paradigm-invest-28-million-in-hong-kong-crypto-trading-firm/#8b074b2b833c) came out this year. So, my algo is making 100% per month profits for Paradigm Capital, and Fred has stolen a lot of money from me, like millions. \n\nWhy is Fred so comfortable profitting off my work, and feeding himself off it? Why am I doing all the hard work out in the fields, and he's sitting back and eating fruit and  primping himself? Fred must have one of those delusions that he's my wife in the olden times. But I never wanted to have that kind of relationship with him. \n\nIf I were an investor who wasn't involved in this, I would take into account that nothing Ehrsam has done aside from my arbitrage algorithm has worked. Augur, Veil, tBTC, MakerDAO... they've all been more problems than solutions. Why would you invest in an ecosystem who's philosophies give dozens of tries to a dishonest guy, while the honest, competent people are boxed out? Uhh... Fred literally killed the patients I could've treated as a doctor, and also those I could've treated on my blockchain platform. That's not good. Fred likes prediction platforms because they can be used to kill people through bounties. U think that's the best way to use a blockchain? Fred you will never kill me with a prediction market. You go try and do that with the money you stole from me. He's making decisions with money that's rightfully mine, spending it on projects that, in my opinion, won't be profitable nor do much to reduce suffering in the world. My opinion as a VC would be that if you're going to blow millions of dollars on high-risk projects, at least choose the ones that will have a positive societal impact. Not tBTC copycat projects and augur bounties etc\n\nRegardless of sexuality, having a dishonest guy like Fred in your ""tribe"" only makes the rest of you look bad. Is it true that in SF you always have to have poke the noobs before doing business with them? Because that doesn't sound fair nor profitable. Divinity doesn't exclusively speak through people who love pretzel sticks.\n\nNow PTT wants to Pied Piper the 14-year-olds over at /r/forniteBR into supporting Ethereum through ""community points"", hoping a changing of the guard on the East Coast will give him an opportunity to rise up? PTT, He will never let that happen. Not because you're gay, but because your tribe destroys people's lives, like Gawker once did. I will die making sure you don't get Ethereum off the ground. \n\nWhat is it about Fred that makes him so proud to keep profitting off my work without paying me? He's not my wife. Maybe he's not much a man, but that doesn't make him a woman living with me on a farm with me in 500 B.C. Do u know how easy it is to lie and backstab people to get ahead when you're smart? Actual smart people don't shoot lay-ups, they don't take the easy way. They go for the D U N K S. Does Joe Lubin's backstabbing mantra account for that?\n\nI just want to be paid for my work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hh8gko/how_to_deal_with_an_ethereum_investor_who_thinks/,4,88

Some of that is ancient data, which can be put on a different drive than the rest of the chaindata, but even without ancient, it's around \~650GB. In early March it wasn't yet 300GB. My guess is that all the DeFi activity is causing the chain to grow much more quickly.\n\nMy big fear is mainnet full nodes approaching 1TB. I suspect this will wipe out a non-trivial number of full nodes. Firstly, my impression is that DappNode and Avado are running on 1TB hard drives, meaning that they won't be able to run a full mainnet node anymore, but I also suspect many others are likely running their nodes on 1TB drives. Without resorting to upgrading to larger SSDs or RAID setups, they'll drop out, too.\n\nIs this as big an issue as I think it is?

hhc56v,1593339912,Blockchain Charging Station for Electric Cars," \n\nHi to all blockchain community from our e-mobility startup team. Two years ago we have started developing our charging station for Electric Vehicles and as we are blockchain enthusiasts too, from the early beginning we desired to add blockchain to electric vehicle charging. The integration of world-wide payment processings brings the flexibility to charge electric vehicles at different locations and EV drivers are able to go whenever they want. Our aim is to make a residential wall box charging station that is compact in size for mobile as well with commercial features so owners can get profit by allowing other drivers to access their charging point.\n\nTo reduce the waiting time of transaction confirmation and bring a good user experience, the charging process starts even with a **zero-confirmation** transaction. As soon as a new transaction is broadcasted to the blockchain mempool, the charging station will immediately (**5-10 seconds** after making a payment) start to supply energy. If that transaction is not confirmed during the next 30 blocks in the Ethereum network, the process will be suspended and [EVSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_station) will wait for network confirmations. If double-spent is detected or transaction is deleted from blockchain, the charging station will stop supplying energy to the electric vehicle. We assume that these events, when payment doesn't reach the recipient, happens rarely, and even in that case, charging stations owner will not lose a lot of money for giving a free charging about 10 minutes (less than 1$). Also, the owner will get a push notification to his phone about each payment state. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](28irrg5pnm751 ""Ethereum QR-payment from mobile wallet"")\n\nFor the friendly user experience and neat design, the charging station displays a payment address as QR-code that is possible to scan via phone camera or mobile wallet app. We have tested about 10 wallets every time it is successful. Also, a price per kWh is displayed in a cryptocurrency, so the driver can select the energy limit and send cryptocurrency. Fiat (USD/EUR) equivalent price is not displayed because the user can see it in his wallet app, or should we display it?\n\nThe charging station owner is able to set up his Bitcoin or Ethereum address for receiving payments and price per kWh in the device web-interface. Usually, one car consumes 15-30 kWh per one session.\n\nYou can watch a video of the driver interacting with the charger. Charging stations are fully automatic and are able to continue charging the car even if the Internet connection is lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![video](9a98r10tnm751 ""Ethereum payment at EV public charging station"")\n\nWe would really appreciate your experience and feedback about this idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. What do you think about zero-confirmation algorithm? Is it secure enough to allow charging as soon as payment is broadcasted to the blockchain? If you have some experience in this field please let us know it.  \n \n2. Should charging station owner set up the price per energy (kWh) in cryptocurrency or in fiat (USD/EUR) (in this case EVSE has to check the exchange rate and show the equivalent in cryptocurrency at the time of payment)?  \n \n3. **What do you think about this idea?** As the device is in ready to use state is it worth the ICO campaign to increase production capacity? If you (or your friend) have a shop, restaurant, cafe, or other business with parking would you like to install such one? PS. If you already want it, we are really happy to cooperate with you. Please contact us via private messages about shipping terms. We have a cheap 14 days **worldwide delivery** (already have clients in the USA, EU, Canada, Australia, and UAE). Also, it is possible to connect our device to your national charging station operators via a standard e-mobility open protocol called **OCPP** and gain advantages both of blockchain and bank card payments.  \n \n\nIf you have other questions please write down in comments or write us directly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hhc56v/blockchain_charging_station_for_electric_cars/,1,0
