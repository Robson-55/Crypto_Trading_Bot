mv6fnq,1618972366,Noob here with a few question!,"Hey everyone!\n\nI bought eth a few months ago for 600$ that I saved.\nI keep them in my Ledger wallet my friend told me to buy so my crypto will be safe. I have a few dumb questions and it would be awesome if you guys can help me:\n\n1)can I invest/loan eth? I know you can loan USDT but I gain more money just holding to my eth without all the fees.\n\n2)sounds kinda weird but I saw a Youtube video of someone showing a eth based site that let people buy and sell crypto for you and they get % of gains. You also have on that site the ""main site bot"" that does that for you for even less. Someone knows what I am talking about? All I remmber is this and when you scroll down a bit you see all the traders and you can Press to see what they are investing in and notes.\nI remmber the name of the site starts with de and you have 3 some where.\n\nThanks for the help!

mvafli,1618989742,ðŸ¤– 99 NFT Robots or how to get free Tesla supporting NFT-movement,"Hey, everyone ðŸ‘‹\n\nI'm here to announce the new era of fintech with a pinch of charity.\n\nCouple of months ago, when all the NFT movement started to become bolder, we had come to idea, which realisation will help the NFT thing grow.\n\nWe came up with a challenge, according to which we will release 1 unique crypto-art per day for 99 days.\n\nBut the most important thing is that we believe in the future of cryptocurrencies and therefore everyone who buys at least 1 copy of 1 drop will have the opportunity to win a Tesla Model S. \n\nWhy Tesla? Because it can be bought for bitcoin!\n\nAnd at the end of the challenge, we will present Tesla to one of the owners of at least 1 robot.\n\nThe winner will be chosen at random, however, the more robots you buy, the more likely you are to win Tesla ðŸš™\n\nðŸ‘‰ Subscribe to our Instagram and Twitter accs, join our Telegram chat and follow the news of the challenge: [linktr.ee/chatexrobots](https://linktr.ee/chatexrobots)\n\nToday we release our first drop, and we will drop 1 robot every day till 29.07. The winner will be announced on 09.09.2021ðŸ”¥\n\n**Who we are**\n\nWe are creators and creative designers of Neobank Chatex, which is one of the fastest growing cryptocurrency services on Telegram. It is a comprehensive service integrated messenger, which has been offering reliable and easy access to cryptocurrency to users from all over the world for more than 3 years.\n\n![video](kgdjgv83ahu61)\n\nThe year 2020 has been extremely eventful for Chatex. In addition to intense activity in the CIS countries, the company also presented its product in the markets of India, Turkey, Georgia, and Latin America. As a result, since the beginning of 2020, about 190 thousand new members have joined the Chatex community, and now their total number is almost 300 thousand people.\n\nIn 2021, from a cryptocurrency exchange in the Chatex messenger, it has grown to the service of a new technological type with its own system of instant and free transfers, a multi-currency wallet, an integrated trading platform and the Chatex Pay payment system. Already this year, Chatex will become a cross-platform service, develop its own mobile application and integrate a cryptocurrency deposit system.\n\nConsidering the background of such activity and outlined plans for the nearest future, participation in the development of digital art is not something unexpected. The NFT market entry becomes a natural vector for Chatex's development. The company has many thoughtful plans and new advances ahead that will help strengthen the liquidity of NFT Chatex Robots.\n\n*To participate in the challenge and get a chance to win a new Tesla and other valuable prizes for collectors, follow Chatex Robots on Telegram:* [*https://t.me/joinchat/iFIc7gTmF-AxOWIy*](https://t.me/joinchat/iFIc7gTmF-AxOWIy)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mvafli/99_nft_robots_or_how_to_get_free_tesla_supporting/,1,0
