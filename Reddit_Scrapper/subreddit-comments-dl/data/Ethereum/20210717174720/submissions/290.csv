kssefg,1610070730,Need assistance with old ether.,"Hi,\n\nAs the title states I need a little assistance ""recovering"" some ether.\n\nIn 2018 I did some light mining and collected roughly 2.2ETH. I have verified that it is indeed still there via checking the address on ""etherchain.org""\n\nI have a ""nodekey"" file, and a ""keystore"" file.\n\nMy question is: what's the easiest way to access this ether, and transfer it to something like Coinbase?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kssefg/need_assistance_with_old_ether/,1,3

kstleu,1610074852,Is there an economically viable way to create a series of one of a kind NFT tokens without coding or without coding much (beginner noob level)?,I‚Äôm a lifelong trading card collector. Recently been working on an idea for an nft series/collection.\n\nI‚Äôve been talking to freelance programmers and the prices they‚Äôre quoting me are kinda high and out of my range. \n\nI see that there are websites that create nfts like mint/rarible etc.\n\nThese seem a bit expensive and impractical unless you are creating single unique tokens like digital art as opposed to a series that resembles trading cards. Not to mention the cost and gas fees per individual token.\n\nThe concept for my series involves a couple hundred thousand uniques. I don‚Äôt need them all to exist at once but I‚Äôm hoping to discover some kind of method to safely and simplistically produce the tokens. \n\nDoes some kind of an nft series generator exist?\n\nI‚Äôm not sure where to begin but I‚Äôm hoping someone out there might have a suggestion.
