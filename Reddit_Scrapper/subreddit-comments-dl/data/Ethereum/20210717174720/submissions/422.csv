lrqbx8,1614209468,Do you think L2 adoption is slow because to end users it's confusing?,"Over the past several days I've been trying to learn the logic behind how plasma, snarks and optimism work. I have a rudimentary idea of how they work now (holy crap the concept of the OVM is interesting). I've been trying out several L2 platforms.\n\nFrom a user perspective, they're confusing. ZKSwap:\n\nhttps://zks.app/en/wallet\n\nIs beautiful. Modern looking UI with some nice CSS and a pretty dynamic animated background. But it requires knowledge of how to switch networks in your wallet companion app. It also requires upfront knowledge about *just what is going on* here. Not intimate details around the math behind why zk proofs work, but just some basic understanding (maybe a quick video or flow chart?) of generally what's going to happen to their ETH or tokens here. Typically people are skeptical to use things they don't understand, and so building a UI that guides a user through the steps required of them would probably be a lot less jarring. I don't think most users would feel safe using this app.\n\nA user would land on their app page and have no idea what anything is, and if they stumble around in the menu they'd see a tutorial under More -&gt; Tutorial that's just a (sort of poorly) formatted PDF that's not very user friendly. Next the user has to fiddle around in back menus of metamask to connect to add another network and then connect to it.\n\nOk I am complaining about zks a lot. Lets check loopring:\n\nhttps://exchange.loopring.io/swap\n\nnow an end user is really confused. Not only is their UI less attractive (sorry, not trying to be a dick, just saying from a user friendly perspective it's more messy) but there's a whole bunch of economic statistics related to AMM being shown here _in addition to_ the L2 mechanics. And also no tutorial.\n\n-----\n\nI think these L2 projects could really benefit from:\n\n1. a better wallet companion app or changes to metamask to make it easier to switch networks. Ideally a website should be able to prompt a wallet companion app to switch to a different network. Wallets should also be louder and clearer as to what network you're connected to.\n\n2. more handholding and cleaner UI on the part of these L2 websites so that regular users can understand them better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lrqbx8/do_you_think_l2_adoption_is_slow_because_to_end/,34,71
