jb1nt4,1602685595,Mining Ethereum in 2020. It's a good time.,"There are two main theories about how ETH will develop further. One suggests that ETH is completely dependent on Bitcoin, it rises and falls along with it at the same time. The second theory argues that Ethereum may soon lose its altcoin status and become an independent cryptocurrency - [according to researchers](https://www.sfox.com/blog/bitcoin-volatility-libra-trump) at the San Francisco Open Exchange (SFOX), for example.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, ETH has risen in price by more than 34%, and this trend continues. Some experts expect the coin to rise to $400- $500 by the end of 2020, the most positive optimists expect it to reach $2,000 in the next year. And all because of the DeFi’s boom and the massive tokenization process, which became possible thanks to the Ethereum technology.\n\n**Foolproof Mining**\n\nToday, to start mining Ether, you do not need to undergo special training or be super tech-savvy. Forums have useful information for beginners. Mining equipment manufacturers are investing more and more money in creating the most productive and easy-to-use and energy-efficient hardware possible. \n\nAccording to [Technavio's calculations](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5031201/global-cryptocurrency-mining-hardware-market-2020), the volume of the world market for mining equipment in 2019-2023 will grow by $2.7 billion. Users usually benefit from such a race, because when the opportunity to “show off technologies” ends, vendors begin to reduce prices for their solutions and offer special conditions.\n\nAs for software, it is better to mine on a specialized one and avoid unnecessary problems. For example, [ethOS](http://ethosdistro.com) or CoinFly's COS copes well with high loads, manages mining processes of any scale and on any equipment through a single interface, automates routine and controls income and expenses.\n\n**Profit in Mining Pool**\n\nGreat thing about mining in 2020 is that you can choose a convenient profitable pool that will regularly fill your virtual pockets with Ether and sleep peacefully, read about what to look for when choosing a pool [here](https://medium.com/@coinfly/how-to-choose-a-mining-pool-34b5c52905a2). The main thing is to understand which one brings more money. Take a look at the [CoinFly pool](https://ethpool.coinfly.cc), which according to independent tests’ giving well profit…\n\n**Hedge risks**\n\nWhenever you’re afraid of losing income due to price fluctuations, buy Put Options (on Binance, for example) or/and short ETH futures.\n\nThank You!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jb1nt4/mining_ethereum_in_2020_its_a_good_time/,1,9
