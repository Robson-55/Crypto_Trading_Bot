m27v86,1615408761,Last will in ETH?,"Hey, \nI've been wondering whether ETH can provide the function of a last will in sort of a smart contract or similar... I also crossposted this over at /r/cryptocurrency but moons take most of the attention, I guess. :)\n\nAnyway.\n\nIn case of my death I have to leave some important passwords to others and like to have them stored safely under my control until then.\n\nI thought about splitting an access file in 3 or more parts and send this to a corresponding number of people.\n\nAs long as I am alive I'd also have to sign the smart contract to continuously deny access to the content.\n\nIn short:  a ""if not signed / dead man switch"" rule must be obtained to grant access.\n\nI'd like to give the other parties access to an encrypted file which contains the passwords / important documents. The password to the encrypted file would only be released from the smart contract if my interaction with it does not happen for a set amount of time.\n30, 60, days -  any amount of reasonable time.\n\n\nHow do I achieve this and which project does provide such a functionality?\nETH maybe?\n\n\nDo you think ETH is stable enough to exist in the unforseen future and is reliable enough today in terms of security?\n\n\nI'd love to hear your ideas.\nSorry, I am not a native speaker. :) Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/m27v86/last_will_in_eth/,1,20
