j5zpcj,1601963155,"About Ethereum mining pitfalls, risks, and threats","Bitcoin miners are massively switching to Ethereum. According to 8btc [estimates](https://news.8btc.com/ethereum-miner-in-short-supply-as-eth-hits-2020-high), the payback period for a Bitcoin miner is 600 days, while for the same metric on Ether it only takes 200 days. But this goodness won‚Äôt last forever. Read about what threatens the development of Ethereum below.\n\n**Hardware and Filling ‚Äì Halfway to Success**\n\nExperienced folks advise taking the most productive video cards, for example, the latest models from Nvidia and AMD. When choosing, pay attention to the amount of video memory (ideally from 2 GB), memory speed (with DDR 5 memory), bus width (better with a 256-bit bus), and cooling (basically there‚Äôs no competition to Radeon devices). Take Radeon RX 570, this 169 USD card produces 24-30 Mh/s, which is superb.\n\n**The Illusion of Stability**\n\nThe entire multi-million community of Ether lovers trembled in early August when the Ethereum Classic network was subjected to several [51% attacks](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/ethereum-classic-suffers-another-51-attack/) at once. In addition, in the first half of 2020 alone, over 5 attacks were carried out on popular DeFi platforms, including Balancer ($500,000 stolen) and bZx (17,500 ETH were stolen in total). Moreover, cybercriminals do not always use technical vulnerabilities, sometimes good old social engineering works.\n\n**Reduction of Reward**\n\nEthereum developers have proposed to reduce the block mining reward by 75%. ConsenSys Managing Director John Leelik [published ](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2878)the EIP-2878 proposal aimed at reducing inflation and preserving purchasing power. If supported, the reward will drop to 0.5 ETH.\n\n**The transition of ETH to ETH 2.0 (PoS)**\n\nWe already wrote about this in the article ""Problems of Ethereum Mining"", and you can also [watch the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTyV0yrsKjo&amp;feature=emb_logo) by Peter McCormack with the project founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nWhile the opportunity is still there, we offer everyone to get the most out of it and mine profitably. For example, take a closer look at the new [CoinFLy ETH Pool](https://ethpool.coinfly.cc/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_content=medium), that nowadays offers more rewards than others, at least by 10%.\n\n**Profit That is Not Profit**\n\nA hidden and obvious problem is choosing the pool based on its profitability. If you only have a few capacities, then it is better to choose a pool that uses the PPS+ model, if you‚Äôve got a lot of them, then a powerful pool with PPLNS is better. And if you‚Äôve got so many capacities that there‚Äôs even enough for others, then you can also go SOLO, buddy.
