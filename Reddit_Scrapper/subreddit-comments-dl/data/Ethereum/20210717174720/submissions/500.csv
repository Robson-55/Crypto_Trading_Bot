The transaction speed is very quick and reliable, bringing the required performance, thanks to a flexible network and low transaction fees. Our framework and plan aim to gain universal acceptance and acknowledgment, culminating in the requisite transition and a new level of growth in the cryptocurrency room.\n\nLet‚Äôs join hands and create something beautiful!\n\nCryptoSwap Finance Website: [http://www.cryptoswap.finance](http://www.cryptoswap.finance/)\n\nWhitepaper: [http://www.cryptoswap.finance/whitepaper.pdf](http://www.cryptoswap.finance/whitepaper.pdf)\n\nCryptoSwap Finance on YT: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dMT1kramM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dMT1kramM)\n\nMain products launched in May/June 2021:\n\n\- Crypto Trade/Exchange - The exchange platform is an automated market maker (AMM) that enables two tokens to be exchanged on the Binance Smart Chain.

It appears that the person methodically did the same with a number of other wallets. My wallet that was drained is relatively new and only connected from one Windows machine through Metamask Firefox extension. A Malwarebytes scan was negative. It is not plausible that anyone had the keys or passphrase, except through my computer or Metamask. How did this person get a list of credentials to go through like this? Is there any post-facto forensic ideas I should think about?
