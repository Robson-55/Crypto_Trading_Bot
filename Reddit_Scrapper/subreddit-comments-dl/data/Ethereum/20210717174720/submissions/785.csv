o26uor,1623961347,Stolen Ethereum,"I must say, I didn‚Äôt think this would happen to me. I made one slight mistake and ALL of my hard earned and accumulated ETH gone in 47 seconds.\n\nI downloaded Metamask and it looks like it was from a phishing site, imported my wallet and all of my ETH was stolen.\n\nI don‚Äôt really know what to do or think. I took all actions, filing a police report, NFIB report. Contacting Metamask, binance, I even tried tracking the transactions myself. I noticed transactions on the Binance Smart Chain and wondered if Binance could assist, no luck. \n\nI‚Äôm just posting this as a reminder for anyone that sees this. Please be extra careful, think not twice but three times before you execute a trade or move aby of your crypto. Just avoid this dumb browser extension wallets at all costs. \n\nLosing such a large sum of money is crazy, but losing that much ETH is even worse. I don‚Äôt know how I will feel when ETH eventually doubles, triples in value. \n\nMy heart is torn right now and my stomach feels bottomless. I just wish I had thought twice before doing what I did and I could have saved myself so much grief. I guess i‚Äôm posting this to not only bring awareness, but to vent.\n\nI hope none of you go through this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o26uor/stolen_ethereum/,88,405

o2imn7,1623998074,Why an Ethereum Air Drop is a good idea,"Uniswap's Air Drop and Dogecoin were the best things to ever happen to me in crypto. Dogecoin has done quite a bit in attracting people to crypto and Uniswap has done the same for DeFi. These stories help make crypto become mainstream and build trust.\n\nThe Ethereum project has splintered into many other similar projects like Binance and Tezos and countless others. They can pull users away permanently from Ethereum. To retain and reward user loyalty and trust, an Ethereum air drop is needed. It could be a life changing thing for the many people who have built upon it and used it.\n\nI propose an air drop in honor of the upcoming change to Ethereum 2.0 for all users of Ethereum, and more so for those who have invested heavily in Ethereum - developers based on the number and size of smart contracts they have deployed.\n\nIt would be a blessing to all users and to the hopeful but unfortunate who have tried to build on Ethereum in vain. Seeing how Ethereum is becoming deflationary, it is possible to do an air drop without diluting the value. It would certainly win the hearts and minds of the crypto community and Ethereum would become the people's hero.\n\nUniswap did the air drop based on wallet address alone. They did not care who you were. I think Ethereum should do the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o2imn7/why_an_ethereum_air_drop_is_a_good_idea/,0,21

Or should I use a more eth centred wallet? I will tell you from now: the eth that is going to be in dove/other wallet, I will send it to crypto.com app. I am asking if I can do that without caring to much about fees.\n5. Will mining eth affect my GPU very badly? I will not mine 24/7. Just 8-10 hours a day.\n6. Is it worth to start mining eth now or is it to late? Should I keep doing what I said in the beggining?
