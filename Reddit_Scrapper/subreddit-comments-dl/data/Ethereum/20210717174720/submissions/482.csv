mga2x0,1617087761,Noob gets rekt by ETH gas fees,"So lately like most people I‚Äôve been hearing a shit ton about NFTs. Being the curious soul that I am I decided to check them out. After doing some research I figured it was something worth my time. Being somewhat of an artist myself (Totally kidding btw), I thought it would be fun to make some, so I did. \n\nNow fast forward a few days to when it‚Äôs time to mint my Picasso esque MS Paint drawings. I go to mint them and it says 15 dollars, in my head I‚Äôm like ‚Äúok this started off as a joke, but now it‚Äôs a $15 dollar joke, pretty expensive joke but fuck it.‚Äù After paying the $15 to get it approved by Rarible, I was encountered by another fee, this time a fee for minting my tokens. \n\nOh no no no PepeLaugh (iykyk)\n\n50 fucking $$$$!!! Being the broke college student that I am, I was like no shot I‚Äôm paying this. So I decided to be a smarty pants and put a custom gas fee. I made it the lowest gas fee possible, $15. Now my $15 joke is a $30 joke and I‚Äôm not finding it as funny anymore. But the story doesn‚Äôt end there. \n\nPepeLaugh\n\nFast forward like a week later, the transaction still hasn‚Äôt gone through. At this point I‚Äôm gassed (pun intended), I say screw it, I‚Äôll pay the $50 just to get this over with. And that‚Äôs what I did, but guess what, I chose to speed up the transaction that had already failed. I SPENT $50 on an already failed transaction. Instead of being a cheap fuck, I should‚Äôve paid the first time instead of messing it up on the second. \n\nLesson here is don‚Äôt mess with ETH and these gas fees man, they ain‚Äôt no joke.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mga2x0/noob_gets_rekt_by_eth_gas_fees/,1,436
