The folders are simply called ""Private"", ""Private 2"" and ""Private 3"". Inside each folder is an identical text file, and they're all called ""Ethereum MetaMask.txt"". The txt file contains one string of letters and words 27 characters long.\n\nObviously i've tried to do some research myself, and all i could find out was what metamask is (Some crypto wallet browser extension).\n\nNow my question is, what in the hell is the code? Is it a wallet code of some sorts? Can i use it for anything?\n\nI dont remember downloading the file, and have never used metamask.

lo9cmw,1613834822,A case for all traditional artists to digitize their work as NFTs.,"I posted this on the NFT board yesterday but I'm posting here too, for discussion. While I'm an artist, I'm also a clinical psychologist - so I like to think about how people think!\n\nAnd full disclosure, I just started minting my art as NFTs on OpenSea, and I can post a link if anyone's interested.\n\nA lot of people have mentioned to me that it's not exactly clear how traditional art (e.g., watercolors, oil paintings) transfer to NFTs. The best ideas that people had were to use the NFT as a digital certificate of authority that gives one ownership of the original artwork.\n\nHowever, I was thinking that there are a few arguments for why the scanned digital asset of a traditional artwork should be *decoupled* from the original, and may be able to hold just as much value, if not more, than the original. Here's the case.\n\n1. Artists have been making prints of their original work for over a century. Many of these can be fairly valuable when signed and numbered - it's the *limited* nature of the prints, and the authorization from the artist, that make it valuable.\n2. Visual art in traditional media is notoriously fragile. Old canvases get holes in them, the varnish on oil paintings goes yellow, pigments in paintings begin to fade over time. Art investments require careful temperature and humidity settings. There are whole industries in art restoration because of this. Digital media does not have this problem. A person who owns one of my digital NFTs in 100 years will have an exact duplicate of the original, never requiring restoration.\n3. Scanning artwork gives the artist an opportunity to make adjustments that bring the digital artwork closer to their vision. If I have a certain vision of vividness and my watercolors can't reproduce that vision, I can actually make colors pop in a digital asset better than I could while fighting the limitations of the media on paper.\n4. Traditional media has limitations when it comes to display. An 8x10"" watercolor can only be displayed in a frame of that exact size, and care has to be taken to have the exact lighting and arrangement necessary. A digital asset version could be blown up to an enormous plasma display, allowing viewers to see details they could never see behind a velvet rope. Or it could be shrunk to the size of a phone screen.\n5. NFTs allow artists to continue getting commissions off sales of their work on the second-hand market. Physical media absolutely do not - there are plenty of stories of artists whose artworks went on to make millions while the artist themselves (and their heirs) died penniless. This incentivizes the artist to prioritize the digital asset OVER the traditional one.\n\nThe key, in my opinion, is scarcity. If I create a single, unique NFT asset for each watercolor I do, that establishes scarcity in a way that creating 100 prints does not. It is just important that as an artist I honor my commitment to not create more versions. But why would I? I would only be devaluing the original, and devaluing my commissions.\n\nThe only counter-argument here is, why would an artist choose traditional media rather than just creating artwork digitally in the first place? I can think of a few reasons - you can still use techniques in traditional media that are not available in digital format. Maybe the artist simply prefers traditional media instead of staring at a glowing screen while they work (this would describe me, since my job requires me to stare at a screen).\n\nAnything I'm forgetting or missing?
