I hope it helps others to learn more about upgrades.\n\nhttps://kushgoyal.com/ethereum-2-upgrade-summary/\n\nOpen to feedback.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nfcpds/ethereum_20_upgrades_explained_in_under_5_minutes/,1,45
nfcskm,1621349728,PSA: Kraken potentially eating deposits &lt;0.05 ETH (~$165)," Kraken has an odd ""minimum deposit"" rule of 0.05 ETH.\n\nThis is noted on the deposit page, so nothing nefarious if the funds go into limbo when the amount is below that.\n\nHowever, what's appalling is:- Kraken only allows 5 addresses at a time. If you generate any more, it expires the old addresses- Kraken doesn't show addresses receiving &lt;0.05 ETH as ""used"", so you have no idea if there's deposits in limbo on it- Once the generated address expires because you added new ones, funds sent to the old ones are unrecoverable- Once an address is expired, there's no ""previous addresses"" history page\n\nI have confirmed all this with Kraken support. They didn't find the lack of disclosure concerning, or that addresses with limbo deposits unbeknownst to the user may be expiring.\n\nOf course, I would love to know how many of my prior expired addresses had limbo deposits, but they can't provide this. Nor can I know since the previous addresses are not displayed in their UI.\n\nThis seems to be a recurring issue:- [https://www.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/comments/kq9hfv/accidentally\_sent\_less\_than\_minimum\_eth/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/comments/kq9hfv/accidentally_sent_less_than_minimum_eth/)\- [https://www.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/comments/nevysa/accidentally\_deposited\_less\_than\_the\_minimum\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/comments/nevysa/accidentally_deposited_less_than_the_minimum_of/)\n\nWith the ETH price where it is, these might not be trivial sums going into Kraken's pocket. There's no accountability or disclosure of it, which I find frustrating.\n\nI love Kraken, but can't see eye-to-eye on this. My recommendation would have been to not expire old addresses and show the ones with limbo deposits as ""pending"" (not unused!). However, their support doesn't feel anything needs to change.\n\nSo I ask the community: Am I in the wrong to find this concerning?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nfcskm)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nfcskm/psa_kraken_potentially_eating_deposits_005_eth_165/,1,2
nfctee,1621349783,Potential arbitrage opportunity with Ethereum ETF's?,"It seems like close-ended funds and ETF's for Ethereum are trading well below the NAV (i.e. the value of ETH that they're holding). For example, with [QETH](https://3iq.ca/the-ether-fund-qethu-qethun/), they're currently trading at a 10% discount compared to NAV.\n\nMy thinking is that, to take advantage of this situation, you would sell ETH and buy QETH when there's a sufficient discount (e.g. &gt;5%) to offset any transaction fees. And when the discount gap closes or turns into a premium, you would sell QETH and buy ETH.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. Negligble third party risk because these funds that are traded on stock exchanges are usually insured or protected somehow.\n2. QETH discount is due to short-term market volatility that will disappear in the medium-term.\n\nWhat am I missing here?

nffpes,1621356639,Ethereum 3.0 - A Roadmap to Zero Fees and Instant Transfers,"1) Zero fees - I think that after adoption progresses it will make sense to move in a direction where there are zero fees - this will remove roadblocks from lots of transactions and enable efficient commerce.\n\n2) Instant transfers - We will need to further reduce transaction time.\n\n3) Reduce network dependency - Allow transactions in emergency situations and where there is no network access or limited access. This is key to a progressive equitable world for everyone.\n\nEach ETH can be represented by something physical. It should be small, durable but also hard enough to counterfit that society has trust in it's value. A blend of materials like paper and cotton can be used to make a small square or rectangle voucher that will fit into your pocket. Because it is thin, you can fit many into your pocket and this will also provide for a layer of redundancy so that you are not dependent on a network in order to pay for something. People won't even need their phones to conduct transactions, they can give these voucher notes to each other instead.\n\nThis would enable instant transactions on-the-spot with zero fees and would be a true economic steroid. Enabling that type of commerce would allow for markets to popup all over and people would make monies.\n\n\-Thub",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nffpes/ethereum_30_a_roadmap_to_zero_fees_and_instant/,1,10
