o460et,1624196845,Migrating from Parity wallet,"Hi, I've been out of Ethereum for a while. The last wallet I used was Parity, which seems to no longer really exist, in any similar form. It's not clear to me what to migrate to. There's MetaMask, there's Exodus. I don't want to run my wallet as a Chrome extension, because that's just utterly ridiculous, so I'm looking at Exodus. (Focused on desktop here)\n\nI just want a wallet to manage my holdings, but Exodus is so focused on ""Apps"", that I don't really care about (yet). I have my private key from Parity, but it doesn't seem possible to just use or import this private key into Exodus or another wallet. They all seem to have their own recovery phrases and the only way to use my funds is to transfer them? Why?\n\nWhat wallet should I use if I just want to use my private key(s) again to manage my coins? I just want a simple interface to moving coins around using private keys.\n\nExodus (and other wallets) are just so opaque somehow, versus the simple wallets of the past. Something seems to have changed since Parity was around and it's left me a bit confused, to be honest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o460et/migrating_from_parity_wallet/,1,11
