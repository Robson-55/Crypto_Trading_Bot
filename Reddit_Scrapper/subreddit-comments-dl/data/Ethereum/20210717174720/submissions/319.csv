As I understand it (so far) the new protocol will use ""staking"" instead of proof of work.   In staking, you put 32 ethereum into a validator, and you are either rewarded or punished with additional/fewer ethereum for your actions.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1) What will happen eventually if they need N validators for the new network, but the available ethereum that want to participate in that scheme vastly exceeds the required number of validators?   Will the new entrants be put into a queue?   Will the network round-robin participation between every validator that wants to participate?  Are such things even decided yet?   \n\n2) If you want to participate as a validator on the new network, that effectively means you will be running your own server and will be constantly under hacking attacks trying to steal away your money?  What are the main security threats you need to protect against?\n\n3) If you buy ETH today, are you fully guaranteed in having your money be portable to the new network?   Do you need to run your ETH 1 coins through some process to officially convert them over to ETH 2, and is that process reversible?   \n\n4) What would be the main arguments for and against starting to participate in ETH 2 today?\n\n5) Has the phase 0 started, and if not when will that happen?

l1udnl,1611217701,Poster to Learn ‚Äî The Value of Ethereum-Eip1559 Proposal,"&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 0wgnyhbwbnc61...*\n\n**An Innovation in the Gas Rate Market / Burning Concept**\n\nIn the current Ethereum system, new transactions need to be packaged by a miner to enter the next block. A higher gasPrice can also encourage miners to package transactions. A rational miner always wants to package the transaction that carries the largest transaction fee. During the peak period, the gas cost becomes unpredictable or even uncontrollable.\n\n**EIP-1559 Ethereum Improvement Proposal**\n\nThe proposal, first made by Vitalik in 2018, aims to reduce transaction fees by introducing fixed rates and a burning mechanism, thereby making the dynamics of the Ethereum blockchain fee more predictable and alleviating congestion.\n\n**EIP-1559, a Predictable Market Rate**\n\nThe basefee will dynamically adjust so that the total gas used in a single block approaches the limit of 10 million gas. Instead of going into miners‚Äô pockets, the basefee will be burned.\n\nTo incentivize miners to package transactions, users can also set Tip, a parameter of the maximum amount that users are willing to pay when a transaction is packaged into the block. In the end, miners will receive the tip.\n\nThe basefee does not fluctuate drastically on changes in network demand, and alleviates the inefficiency in the past ‚Äúbidding‚Äù model (which is what the tip follows), making the gas fee more predictable.\n\n**EIP-1559 Burning Mechanism**\n\nThe burning mechanism promoted by EIP-1559 (the destruction of the basefee) establishes the dominance of ETH in the Ethereum ecosystem, provides a deflation mechanism for the supply of ETH, and makes tokens scarce and secured in the long run. All these will benefit ETH holders as a result.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l1udnl/poster_to_learn_the_value_of_ethereumeip1559/,1,23
