Cryptocurrency investors mostly measure their wealth in US dollars, not in Bitcoin. Getting rich in US dollars is what they want to do. Replacing the US dollar with cryptocurrency would seriously damage their wealth. It is not what they want to do.\n\nThe original vision of the early Bitcoin adopters was that cryptocurrency would replace the legacy financial system. But instead, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is being absorbed into it. A decade from now, cryptocurrencies will be a normal part of the investment landscape. And when central banks start issuing cryptocurrencies, they'll become a normal part of the payments infrastructure too.\n\nBut replacing the US dollar, and the banks &amp; central banks that depend on it?
