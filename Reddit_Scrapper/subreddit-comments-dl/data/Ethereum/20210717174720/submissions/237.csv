k6r3su,1607108326,Why it is a good thing Jun Hasegawa left OMG network,"What was omg network? It’s a concept that vitalik buterin and joseph poon come up with. It’s a project we invest in based on certain claims what was made by Jun Hasegawa\n\n&gt; OmiseGO is building a decentralized exchange, liquidity provider mechanism, clear- inghouse messaging network, and asset-backed blockchain gateway. OmiseGO is not owned by any single one party.\n\nFirst paragraph from the white paper. OmiseGO is not owned by any single one party. Funny that because it was just sold by one single party \n\n&gt; Owning OMG tokens buys the right to validate this blockchain\n\nAnother claim from the white paper which was simply a lie. No one was aloud to validate expect Jun \n\n&gt; As part of the consensus rules of this network, it is required that all OMG (Omise GO) validators also run the Ethereum network to validate in parallel.\n\nHow many OMG validators was their?\n\n&gt; In order to build this decentralized interchange network, it requires not only a blockchain well-suited for payments and interchange of issued tokens, but also a decentralized exchange which supports these activities\n\nHow did that decentralised network work out? Ended up being sold by a single entity so much for being decentralised!! \n\n&gt; 02/04/2018 OMG website: Big news guys: OMG and cosmos have decided to start spooning...hard. That’s right, you get a token, you get a token, everybody gets two tokens!\n\nMore lies from Jun Hasegawa \n\n&gt; 14/06/2020 Twitter: My company is everything for me. It’s my life\n\nYea so he sold out six months later because it ment everything to him\n\n&gt; 13/05/2020 Twitter: Imagine if it’s on #OmiseGO. More Faster and cheaper. However first of all we have to tokenizing more cash into the chain. Otherwise we never get programmable money + new decentralized internet for society. Our subsidiaries connecting dots for new payment. #Synqa #Omise twitter.com/\n\nHe is clearly delusional if he thinks OMG was decentralised \n\n&gt; 06/06/2019 Twitter: Grow and conquer entire market, Or go home. \nAsk your self ""If you have Billion $, Are you sure you will get whole market ? That what you are doing right now?"" \nI also asked my self, ""Do i really have team that capable to lead this?""\n\nGrow and conquer entire market or go home. Well now we not what one Jun took \n\n&gt; 24/5/2019 Twitter: People can’t trust Centralized party because of data utilization etc doesn’t mean people can trust decentralized apps spontaneously, Industry need to gain trust from mass people by industry credit proof and adoption with phenomenal user experience\n\nI agree people can’t trust centralised party because they can get up and go when ever they want without a single word or explanation why\n\n&gt; 01/08/2018 Twitter: While L2 scaling solution #Plasma and others supporting real business adoption in 2018~ , L1 (Including sharding) will ready for significant massive adoption of #Ethereum . #OmiseGO #OMG teams already helping a lot of real business to adopting this new era / tech. Matter of time\n\nTwo years and four months later “a lot of real business” turned into two company’s \n\n&gt; 30/07/2018 Twitter: Crypto economics my perspective / prediction 2019 : Real business adoption / UIUX focus tools / More Dapps \n2019~2020 : #Ethereum massively scale and used by gov. We will see huge difference between real adoptable protocol and toxic speculation project.\n\nWe will see huge difference between real adoptable protocol and toxic speculation says the man who does nothing but speculate \n\n&gt; 16/07/2018 Twitter: One of beautiful things of blockchain space is Community engagement. I really glad to having strong #OMG #community for supporting open source OMG Network project.\nThank you for all your support. We are keep our transparent communication. #OmiseGO #Plasma\n\n“Transparent communication” at this point you just have to laugh. Not much communication for last two years and it definitely wasn’t Transparent what was going on behind the scenes \n\n&gt; 13/12/2017 Twitter: “Unbank the Banked” #OmiseGO #Ethereum True decentralization.\n\nIt was a central company owed by one person, sold by one person with no consulting with the community. \n\n&gt; 10/10/2017 Twitter: No, I'm not worry about those things. \n&gt;1. More important things is how we will make Omise acceptance and OmiseGO working seamlessly \n&gt;2. How we will transition all our customers to new generation of public chain without hustle.\n&gt;3. Maintain our security on DEX network.\n\nPoint number two obviously is a lie just like most things Jun claimed. We should be great full that such a character is no longer in charge of our project. He has no leadership skills and should not be in charge of such a project with so much potential. \n\nOMG a concept that vitalik buterin and joseph poon come up. A project that we invested in to get started and change our world and lives. That a team built to the best of their abilities. That Jun Hasegawa sold for his own profit \n\nHe never wrote the white paper \n\nHe never invested in the ICO\n\nThe team built OMG network with hard work and dedication\n\nWhich Jun sold for personal profit. Good riddance. \n\nFor the team that work night after night for a project we all wanted to succeed congratulations on everything you achieved \n\nFor the moderators who have to deal with our moaning day after day sorry for your hardship\n\nFor Jun who continuously lied about the project and where it was headed it’s all your fault that so much complaining happened on this sub. I hope to never see your name again in the crypto space\n\nAll quotes was taken from @JUN_SYNQA",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/k6r3su/why_it_is_a_good_thing_jun_hasegawa_left_omg/,1,2
