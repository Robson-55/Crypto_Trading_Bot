la1ht6,1612180669,Ethereum and scarcity,Hello!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am new to ether and have a question about the scarcity aspect.\n\nIs it possible for ether to become more scarce? Or will it always have a steady supply that's mined and so in the long term it can not crack the same price point that bitcoin?\n\nWill eth 2.0 affect this in any way?\n\nCheers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/la1ht6/ethereum_and_scarcity/,69,70

But in the interim, I'm wondering what strategies can be used to save on gas?\n\nI'm a relative new-comer to DeFi but am excited to get more involved. The problem is that many of the things I'd like to don't do make sense without investing large sums of money. i.e. I want to set my girlfriend up to lend some money on Compound. I wanted to shift some of my BAT around. and I wanted to test out PoolTogether. With tx fess what they are, none of this makes any financial sense right now.

The cashier scoffed and said, ""no can do, friend - we're not gonna sit here for a quarter of an hour waiting for you to pay for your Whopper Jr.""\n\nI guess my question is whether there are future plans and if so what are they to lower transaction latency?\n\nSorry if this has been asked before!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/la40v8/barriers_to_drivethrough_purchases/,6,10

la4ogu,1612190895,Adopting XDai Stable Chain as a layer 2 solution,"I have recently been looking in to XDai, and it looks beneficial to Ethereum for use right now. The fees on Ethereum are at a point where if you aren't doing a large buy, then it's worthless to even use dex's such as uniswap, as your ETH gets eaten up by transaction fees. The fees on XDai are much smaller in comparison, will be a traders dream, and it's possible to gain access to them using a dex such as honeyswap.\n\nThe problem I see is that it's quite technical to use because of the bridging of your tokens, and difficult to figure out. It's already quite technical using uniswap, so this extra layer adds complexity. This is why there isn't much liquidity on honeyswap.\n\nCan anyone involved with XDai or Ethereum tell me if dapps are being built that will be integrated with wallets such as MEW, to do this bridging of tokens with a few clicks, and then complete honeyswap trades within MEW (as you can with uniswap)? This feature in MEW would be a game changer for liquidity. With a few simple clicks you could convert every token in MEW to the XDai version, and trade to your hearts content.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/la4ogu/adopting_xdai_stable_chain_as_a_layer_2_solution/,5,6
