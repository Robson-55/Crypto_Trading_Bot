l1uyv0,1611220469,Opinions on bitpanda,"Hi Eth community, pretty much self explanatory title. Iâ€™m quite a fan of bitpanda, mostly because their KYC is light to say the least. Wonâ€™t go with Binance out of principle and coinbase Iâ€™m not a fan of. What are your opinions on this platform? FYI I store on hard wallet &amp; own about 20 different crypto with Eth &amp; ada being my most popular. \nThanks !",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l1uyv0/opinions_on_bitpanda/,1,3

l1vpb5,1611223847,MSI Radeon Rx 5700XT Gaming X Afterburner/Mining settings.," \n\nHello guys, this is barely my second post on the subject so please be kind.\n\nIm interested in starting the journey of mining, and after some info i found out that the card i bought for gaming is one of the best possible cards for mining as well!\n\nSo i wanted to ask, what is the BEST possible settings in afterburner/radeon centre, and in general, so i get the highest hash speed WITHOUT altering my bios or hurting my machine in any way. I also want to preserve its life and not burn it, or make it die prematurely if i leave it non stop for mining, because after all im just some guy that chipped in to buy a new gpu and would be really bad for me if it failed, not a seasoned miner with a bunch of gpus and if one dies has no effect on me.\n\nNormally theres plenty guides out there but they all alter the bios, and i want to still use this machine for my browsing, chatting and gaming, and when im sleeping or working, since i never power it down just earn a little bit of revenue maybe.\n\nIn the imgur post i attach my current results and settings, please guide me if youre in the know.\n\nOne notable detail that i want to add is, that in afterburner some settings seem to not want to go on the values i set, and most importantly, for some very weird and upsetting reason, when i increase the memory clock at anything over 1750 My screens (dual -trial setup) start to flicker. Only when i go lower than that they stop. Do i have a bad faulty card, or why is that?\n\nThank you for your time!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xB7lZt3](https://imgur.com/a/xB7lZt3)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l1vpb5/msi_radeon_rx_5700xt_gaming_x_afterburnermining/,1,0
