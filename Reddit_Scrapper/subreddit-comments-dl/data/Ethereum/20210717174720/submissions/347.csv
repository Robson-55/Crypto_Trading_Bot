This was my first transfer out of Gemini just to test the waters and see how everything works with an outside wallet. I have found plenty of info on gas fees but a few questions remain : \n\nIs there no fee when transferring into the Ethereum network? It only costs to transfer it back to Gemini?

I was curious how gas works in dapp games? \n\nI understand gas as a transaction fee in smart contracts, but when I simply issue a command on my character e.g. move to a new location and load in visual assets, does that command cost anything? Just quickly messing around on some of the dapps seems to suggest not unless I were to purchase things in-game. But there‚Äôs still computational power required by the ‚Äúserver‚Äù to process my request right? So is that cost compensated somehow? In a conventional gaming company they would have to run maintenance on the servers to keep it sustainable so if the distributed network isn‚Äôt compensated somehow is it sustainable for these networks to offer this service?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lajkud/gas_in_dapp_games/,2,4

If I can use 1 eth as collateral, say it trades at $1000, and I trade at 2x leverage, and I put in a long at 1000 for 1 eth, ETH would need to go down to 500 for me to get liquidated correct? I‚Äôm also not REALLY sure what trading at 2x leverage means in terms of profit. In the scenario i mentioned above, does that essentially mean I‚Äôm longing with 1 ETH? \n\nif what I‚Äôve said is correct so far, it seems like a relatively safe strategy with good upside.
