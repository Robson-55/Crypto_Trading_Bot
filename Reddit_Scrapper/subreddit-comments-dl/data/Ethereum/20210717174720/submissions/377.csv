libgr0,1613138076,Semi-technical questions from a software engineer,"Hi all, I've read a bunch of articles on ethereum and the inner workings of crypto in general, but some things are still fuzzy to me as far as how they work.\n\n1) Is the entire blockchain on every node in the network? If so, how will this scale over time? If not, doesn't that mean that over time, some nodes will be 'historical nodes' which will ultimately become fewer and fewer and could theoretically reach 0?\n\n2) Where is the code for smart contracts stored? Is it on every node in the network? In the case of 'historical nodes' with #1, doesn't that mean that mean that there is a theoretical case where code for old smart contracts won't exist on the network any more?\n\n3) If the code for smart contracts resides on nodes in the network, what is to stop someone from creating a smart contract with a billion lines of code with the intent of not executing it, but just causing memory issues on the nodes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/libgr0/semitechnical_questions_from_a_software_engineer/,1,6

liblrt,1613138521,Noob question: Use Binance network or leave ETH on exchange,"Hey everyone,\n\nI've already asked this question on r/ethtrader, but didn't get any replies, so I figured you guys might be of more help. I recently purchased some ETH on Binance. I had done some research beforehand, and decided to use the MEW android wallet to secure my funds. Problem is, I can't really afford to move my tokens with these gas prices. So here's the question: not being able to use my preferred ERC wallet, should I use Binance's Trust Wallet instead, which is much cheaper to send crypto to as it uses Binance's chain, or should I leave it on the exchange? What are the disadvantages of using BEP20 or Binance Smart Chain if I just plan to hold and to add some more from time to time?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/liblrt/noob_question_use_binance_network_or_leave_eth_on/,1,8
