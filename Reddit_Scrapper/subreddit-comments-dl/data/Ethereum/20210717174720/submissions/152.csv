ivngom,1600497516,FOMO into DeFOMO,"*Fear of missing out* can be an incredibly strong emotional force when it comes to an investors decision making. Keeping emotion out of the investment game is difficult enough. Preventing yourself from investing in a stock/cryptocurrency can be one of the hardest things you can do, and for good reason. While not every ***FOMO*** experience is a slam dunk, ***DeFOMO*** aims to be just that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2f6vatoqu1o51.jpg?width=312&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b0663027a2eda9cfe2e1e01c3eb0c8a0dcfb40e\n\n \n\n***DeFOMO*** (***FOMO***) is an ERC20 token on Ethereum that is driven by FOMO itself. When taking into account the current landscape of crypto, ***FOMO*** can be one of the largest contributing factors in the decentralized finance craze. ***DeFOMO*** is set to capitalize on this, but in an innovative way. The circulating/total supply of the token is 1,000,000. Liquidity mining is also implemented into the smart contract via providing liquidity to the pool. 0.05% of ***FOMO*** will be distributed to these liquidity providers on a daily basis, with new providers being dispersed ***FOMO*** starting on the next distribution cycle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe tokens economy is funded by the presale, where 30% of the presale funds will be sent to the ***DeFOMO*** pot. After launch, a 3.3% transaction fee (3% of this fee is taken by ***FOMO***, and 0.3% taken by Uniswap) will be applied to every transaction in the ***FOMO*** economy. Of that 3% transaction fee taken by ***FOMO***, 20% of that fee will be used in the ***DeFOMO*** buyback system, 40% of that fee goes into the ***FOMO*** Pot, and the remaining 40% goes to liquidity providers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ***DeFOMO*** Pot is one of the biggest driving forces in the ***FOMO*** economy. The Pot has a 24 hour timer. The timer slowly counts down to zero, but if someone buys ***FOMO***, the timer is replenished with 15 seconds each time a buy is sent through the economy. Sells do not trigger a 15 second replenishment. If and when the ***FOMO*** Pot reaches 0, the last buyer of ***FOMO*** will receive 65% of the funds in the pot, with the remaining pot funds rolled over into the next 24 hour cycle. This mechanism and design creates a large incentive to buy ***DeFOMO*** and creates unique tokenomics which will look to increase demand at every purchase. A quick visual of how the ***FOMO*** economy works can be seen below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j92m059vu1o51.jpg?width=711&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ea2397a22f28b43afbe39164e7db494f555495d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n As mentioned above, Liquidity providers of ***FOMO*** are also included in the distribution model. This creates an incentive to our your ***FOMO*** to work instead of just holding. In addition, every person who refers a friend to the ***FOMO*** presale will get 10% of the presale tokens held by the referral. The presale will begin on 9/19/20 14:00 UTC+0.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***FOMO*** is a non-minable token, and all 1,000,000 tokens will be distributed into the ***FOMO*** economy as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vxjev09zu1o51.jpg?width=793&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a6993a0a900b279c1dbe0a73d95cc2b03301a71\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Its interesting to note that the development team has decided to lock up their share of tokens to instill trust in the community and fellow ***FOMO***ers. There will also be a small airdrop of ***FOMO*** at a later time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn their whitepaper, which can be found here, the development team has provided a short but detailed road map which can be seen below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4icu6j1v1o51.jpg?width=538&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d57062f99476265bdd0dd4f7190a9fc8392c1e1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n*Decentralized Finance* is proving to be a driving force in the cryptocurrency industry and has shown no signs of slowing down. New innovations, like **DeFOMO** are being tested and studied to see how DeFI can truly alter the financial world we have come to know and appreciate. *‚ÄúHow long will it last? Is it sustainable?‚Äù* Time will tell. But the question we will all have an answer to soon is, *‚Äúwill you DeFOMO?‚Äù*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I write articles and reviews for legitimate, interesting, up and coming cryptocurrency projects. Feel free to PM me to review your project. Thank you!* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. The sole purpose of this post/article is to provide an informative and educated discussion regarding the project in question.
