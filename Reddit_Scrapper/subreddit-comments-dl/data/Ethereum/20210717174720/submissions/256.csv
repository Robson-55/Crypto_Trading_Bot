It seems like Vitaik controls all aspects of the ethereum platform. For a decentralized platform, it's a little concerning. I heard he infamously reversed huge transactions in the past which basically breaks the blockchain (hardfork?). Like this is fundamentally against everything crypto is supposed to be so I'm kinda not trusting this guy. Now I'm hearing there's multiple versions of ethereum which is the result of hard fork I suppose. Also there's the problem of unlimited supply of coins which I think doesn't make sense.
