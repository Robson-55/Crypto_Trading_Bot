mgy5ov,1617165116,How long does using 'save low' gas fees take,I looked on &lt;a href=https://www.etherchain.org/tools/gasPriceOracle&gt;Eth gas price oracle&lt;/a&gt; that's sourced from EthGasStation and sent a transaction using the 'save low' price of 9 GWei that said would take &lt;30 minutes to go through. I only did it because I thought the price was just low and would go back up soon. I only sent about 0.015 eth so it doesn't suck too much if I lose it. Is it completely hopeless it will get picked up and it was just like a glitch in eth gas station or will it just take a very long time to go through?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mgy5ov/how_long_does_using_save_low_gas_fees_take/,1,15
