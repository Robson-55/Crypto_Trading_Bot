ke9fwk,1608126360,Dai Hard - A Christmas challenge,"An explosion rocks Serenity City.\n\nIn the aftermath a message is anonymously dropped onto an obscure cypherpunk mailing list.\n\n    It is unfortunate that your elected officials were not able to meet my most reasonable demands.\n    \n    Perhaps now they will see that 10 million Dai would have been the least costly option after all.\n    \n    Thankfully for them, I believe that everyone deserves a second chance.\n    \n    I have planted another bomb in Serenity City, this time a dirty bomb containing radioactive material.\n    \n    After block 11525000 the bomb will be triggered.\n    \n    Merry Christmas, old friends.  \n\nThe SCPD manage to locate the bomb, but find themselves unable to disarm or move it due to a selection of anti-tampering measures protecting the device.\n\nIn desperation they post a reward contract for its successful deactivation:\n\n[Bomb disposal contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x673fd2220c495d4fe5ef91d65f5689d95f7a72d1#code)\n\nIs there anyone out there able to bypass the anti-tampering, cut the right wires and then disarm the bomb?\n\n[Countdown to detonation](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/11525000)\n\nTo optionally contribute to the disarm reward fund, feel free to send ETH to the contract address (do not send tokens as their withdrawal is not supported).",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ke9fwk/dai_hard_a_christmas_challenge/,1,12

kebvaj,1608134612,Why would wrapped ETH2 trade at a different price than ETH?,"Binance, Coinbase and Kraken all announced they’ll support ETH2 liquidity with a wrapped token. Binance said if BETH opens for trading then the price will be determined by the market and they can’t guarantee it. Assuming ETH will be converted to ETH2 1:1, and each BETH/wrapped ETH2 represents 1 ETH2, how come BETH could trade at a price different than ETH? For example, wBTC is pegged to BTC price 1:1 right?

kec0f5,1608135057,[ETH2] Delay in attestation can save a validator from slashing?,"I'm still digging, and probably I'm wrong, but it seems to me more like a *hole* in the specs.\n\nFew hours ago [validator 1644](https://beaconcha.in/validator/1644) was slashed for attesting the same slot with different content. This time though, [that false attestation was signed by 4 validators](https://beaconcha.in/block/102389#attester-slashings) but only one was slashed.\n\nLooking at data it seems to me that the slashed one did a ""wrong attestation"" on time, while the other three were out of sync with the network and it seems their votes were not counted for slot 102388. \n\nFew minutes later then, those three validators got rewarded for the same false attestation because it was included in slot 102391. They got payed 1/3 of normal reward because of delay, but they was payed and they are still validating now without problems.\n\nBecause there is no errors and it seems the consensus is reached among all the clients out there, this lead me to think it can be a bug in the spec (or maybe a ""feature"" that I still don't understand well).\n\nIdeas?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kec0f5/eth2_delay_in_attestation_can_save_a_validator/,1,0

This is a huge moment in the development of Kleros creating a fully autonomous platform under the full control of community members and PNK holders.  \n\nUntil now, Kleros had been using Aragon Governance to vote on proposals made to change parameters or functions within the Kleros protocol and dapp suite.
