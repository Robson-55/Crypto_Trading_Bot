lu1lno,1614473734,A solution to the erratic supply growth caused by uncle rewards and base fee burning,"I am open to criticism, if you disagree I'd love to hear why.\n\nA proper currency should be a medium of exchange. A way of converting labour into other physical things. That conversion is done through selling the physical result of your labour, or in our traditional system, the direct selling of your labour to employers (I would say the latter is not a good way of doing things, but that's a different conversation). If what you sell is wanted by others, your labour is worth more, if its not wanted, its worth less. You have to do labour that provides value to others.\n\nThe currency is what provides the conversion of your labour to other products. This currency should hold the same purchasing power over time. In order for it to work effectively, it should neither inflate nor deflate.\n\nInflation results in people losing their works value, and in people spending more than they should. That is what we have right now. People are spending more than they can afford and as a result, debt is very high.\n\nDeflation results in people not spending their money. This makes economic growth much harder, as money will not move. Gaining currency becomes increasingly difficult, as very little will want to spend. This means it is harder for people with less currency to be able to satisfy their needs, as they have very little currency to do it with.\n\nBitcoin, is deflationary. First of all, it has sudden decreases in its emission every 4 years, and the supply will consistently go down due to lost coins, making it less desirable as a currency.\n\nEther's current emission model would make sense if it wasn't for uncle block rewards and (after EIP 1559 is implemented), base fee burning.\n\n2 is ETH generated every 13 seconds. Assuming that the amount of ether lost per block goes up when the total supply goes up, eventually there will be an equilibrium, where the amount of ETH lost will match the amount lost, resulting in a stable supply. So, the optimal supply growth model of a cryptocurrency should be linear.\n\nUncle block rewards make the supply growth more erratic. Which brings makes the emission more erratic and less linear. \n\nAlso, now that the base fee is being burned, this will cause more of an erratic supply growth, and possibly deflation. Deflation is not a good thing. Its only a good thing if all you care about is price, and you don't actually plan on using ether as a viable currency.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean EIP 1559 and uncle block rewards can't be good. Here is my potential solution:\n\nInstead of giving out the newly minted coins every single block, instead do it every n blocks (n could be 10, 20, 500, etc). Let's set n as 100 for now. So every block gives 2 ETH currently, so let's say the total given out every 100 blocks is 200 ETH.\n\nNow, this amount will be distributed among the miners of every block, and uncle block. Let's say 75% of it is equally distributed among every miner, and 25% is distributed equally among every uncle block miner.\n\nThis gets rid of the erratic growth that uncle block rewards introduce.\n\nNow to add the base fee into the equation.\n\nThe total amount of ETH burned gets added to the ETH that is distributed among miners.\n\nBecause of these changes, the supply growth would be completely linear, making Ether a more viable currency.\n\nAgain, I want to hear criticisms of this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lu1lno/a_solution_to_the_erratic_supply_growth_caused_by/,3,10
