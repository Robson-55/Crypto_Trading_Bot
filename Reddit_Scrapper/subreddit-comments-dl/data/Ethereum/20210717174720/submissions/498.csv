mjxj6u,1617547458,How to DAO?,"Are there any reliable solutions to build from or do I need to build one from the ground up? I found Alchemy DaoStack, but that seems like it may be too limited for what I want to do. Also, their voting system currently requires .2ETH just to submit a proposal which seems ludicrous and I'd like to minimize that so that the community is much more free to submit their ideas. However, I'd ultimately like to have safeguards in place to constrain the types of proposals that are permitted -- what's the best mechanism for controlling that? Just establishing the constraints in the bylaws? Basically, I only want the DAO to be able to pursue certain types of projects, not any project since that could result in some degenerative projects, at least initially when the individuals within the voting body have larger stakes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjxj6u/how_to_dao/,1,0
