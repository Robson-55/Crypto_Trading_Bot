nm6ura,1622120264,Instagram Posts as NFTs,"Looking for feedback, good people.\n\nA couple of friends and I are working on an app that will let users mint their own Instagram posts as NFT's so that they can offer it to their followers. We're still a couple of weeks away from releasing it but the thinking is that content creators or artists could have a way to monetise their creations. Perhaps in a way it could be a way for up &amp; coming influencers to create value too - an early post on Instagram might be worth little for someone unknown but would be higher-priced if they become popular, so almost like their own 'shares'.\n\nI was wondering what everyone thought about this.

nm9y0k,1622129214,How does proof of stake create value?,"To simplify things, let's say there are 10 people with coin.\n\nIn the case of proof of work, for them to make more coin, one of them has to invest in specialized equipment and energy to create that new coin. They are using money from the outside world to create something valuable. Anyone from outside who also wants a coin should reasonably also pay money from the outside world equal to what it took to make that coin (there is no incentive to sell for less). So everyone with coin is slightly richer.\n\nIn the case of proof of stake, for them to make more coin, they don't have to invest anything. It takes nothing extra for them to stake their coin. Now there is more coin and no extra value. Anyone from outside who also wants a coin can reasonably pay them less, since the cost is not tied to anything of value in the real world. So everyone  with coin is slightly poorer.\n\nIsn't proof of stake like a pyramid scheme hoping for new money to be brought in?
