n7c9ch,1620430805,Anybody have any info on the old LETH ethereum wallet from 2017? I apparently have an encrypted keystore file on my computer that came from that Android app,"I was a crypto noob back in 2017 and was messing around on Coinbase and bought $20 worth of Ether for giggles and sent it to a random wallet I downloaded off of the Google Play store. And I didn't opt to write down the passphrase anywhere, but instead use a keystore.\n\nWell now that wallet is over $4000. And I have the keystore file for it. BUT IT'S ENCRYPTED, which means it's proprietary to this www.inzhoop.com wallet. Not only that, but from what I see, the website has been shut down. I can, however, download the app from the Google Play store. However, within the app, there is no option for restoring from a keystore or encrypted keystore anywhere. Only from a seed phrase.\n\nThe ending of the keystore's filename is ' lethKeystore.json ', the beginning of the file starts with ' ""{\""encSeed\"":{\""encStr\"": ', and the ending of the file starts with ' ,\""salt\"":\""lightwalletSalt\"",\""version\"":2}"" '. This info might help you if you know about keystore files.\n\nI was apparently emailed the keystore file via this app. Here's what was in the email:\n\n""A LETH backup wallet is attached.\npowerd by Ethereum from Inzhoop\n\nGet Outlook for Android""\n\nSo if you have any info on keystore files, or encrypted keystore files, or how to restore via this LETH wallet please let me know. Perhaps an older version of the wallet has this ability to load keystore files? If so, I can have an older version sideloaded.\n\nHere is the etherscan of my lost wallet:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xfc9154f217b3ec3139b56724d97a47ec933242c6\n\nSo it's worth $4700 dollars right now. If you can help me recover this wallet, I can toss the FIRST person who helps me about $1000 from this wallet. If you hook me up with the contact info of the developer of this wallet, and he manages to help me recover this wallet, I'll pay the dev ETH from this wallet for taking some time to help my sorry butt along with the person who gives me his contact info. My Google-fu is failing me right now. In the second scenario I'll pay the dev $1000 and the FIRST person to help me $500. I prefer the first scenario.\n\nI'm an honorable guy. I will pay out. I consider this wallet as good as gone, anyways. If so, it's only a $20 learning lesson lmao.\n\nIf anything, this story is a learning lesson for people not to invest in something you know absolutely nothing about. I know a lot more about crypto these days, and I have multiple locations for where I put my seed phrases, and I use more reputable wallets now. I also don't use keystore files anymore at all. So learn from my mistake, lads.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n7c9ch/anybody_have_any_info_on_the_old_leth_ethereum/,1,2

n7dztu,1620436567,"Fees, value, &amp; demand - will the bull run continue? ETH 2.0? Simple explanation of Ether improvement proposal 1559 and how it’s fueling current ATH pricing.","I felt compelled to author this small tidbit after seeing several posts explaining Ether 2.0, it’s benefits, and timeframe. They all lacked what I’m about to explain.\n\nI’ll start by saying this isn’t about STAKING. This topic has been spoken about enough, and it’s creating spam due to ppl trying to refer others to newer platforms with higher staking fees. It’s also creating scams. Be wary of new platforms, do your own DD!\n\n**Gas fees have been mentioned with minimal effort. I’ll explain briefly and also why this is pertinent to my main point.**\n\nBasically the ether blockchain uses computer power which needs energy, the consumption (cost) of the energy plus mining fees (newly minted coins) are what comprise the typical gas fee paid to miners. It creates a spam free and secure environment, but it’s expensive due to ether’s unlimited coin cap. The fee structure is also changing from individual miners to the network itself creating a more “fair” fee.\n\n**JULY 2021:**\n\n#EIP1559\n\nEIP1559 is technically phase 3 of the ethereum 2.0 roll out. Differing from other phases there is a hard start date this July. This update is creating the current surge.\n\n**This “fix” is going to GREATLY reduce gas fees. It will make ETH deflationary, not by capping the coin, but by drastically reducing the number of newly minted coins while simultaneously adding cash burns to the blockchain.**\n\n\n**Simply put; this update is going to add value and create demand.**\n\n\n*The deflationary measures alone will add value while the minimization of new coins creates less supply and more demand. This recipe lead to the recent run up to $3,500.*\n\n**Miners and ether aficionados are calling this update: The Ethereum Scarcity Engine.**\n\nAll of these updates *ARE HAPPENING* this July. People have been hurrying to grab coins now before the fix goes live. They will continue to do so until the fix and up until 2.0 is officially launched. Thus continuing a bullish run.\n\nEthereum is now searched more then Bitcoin. \n\n**Ethereum improvement proposal 1559 will reduce fees, reduce supply, and create demand.**\n\n*This is not financial advice. This is my opinion based on factual information.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n7dztu/fees_value_demand_will_the_bull_run_continue_eth/,1,0
