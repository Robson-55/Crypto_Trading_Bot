imzwue,1599307093,Secrether - Secret data in DApps,"&amp;#x200B;\n\n![video](vk7h1bzijbl51)\n\n Everyone knows that the blockchain is transparent - anybody can read any data from the blockchain. This makes impossible the creation of a wide range of applications. We solve this problem by storing sensitive data on our servers and ensure its integrity and immutability by a publicly available cryptographic hash.We provide easy-to-use APIs both for Ethereum Smart Contracts and REST APIs for back/front end. It has never been easier to build a DApp, that uses sensitive data but still benefits from all the advantages of the blockchain.\n\nWe provide well documented APIs which are available [here](https://docs.secrether.io/) as well as easy copy-paste tutorials for Solidity and Javascript. This speeds-up your DApp creation process and makes it easiest possible!\n\n[https://secrether.io/](https://secrether.io/)\n\nDo you have any feature requests or improvement proposals, community?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/imzwue/secrether_secret_data_in_dapps/,1,0
