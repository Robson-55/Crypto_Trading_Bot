j42iag,1601671073,Hypothetically Speaking - The Dao Hack,"Hi guys, don't wanna get my hopes up cause is not clear to me yet how the whole ETH ""rollback"" after the infamous Dao disaster went down back in 2016, but i remember i participated, got my dao tokens and sent them to Poloniex, after the news of the hack I panic sold those tokens, owned my loss and moved on, completely, meaning i didnt even looked back, fast-forward 2021 watching some crypto documentary i found out ethereum did a ""rollback"" back in 2016, so.. And this is why the ""hypothetically"" comes in play, so hypothetically speaking, in the very unlikely case in which by some miracle I manage to find the wallet keys from which i sent those ETH to the DAO, do I still have those ETH or not? from what i was able to find, seems the rollback was undo  the dao's hack, but is still unclear what happened from there on, did the dao returned the ETH to their respective funding addresses? if you had to send those Dao tokens to some contract i guess i moved on for a reason, anyhow, i know its a long, long, really long shot, I just want to put this thing in my head to rest and move on once again.
