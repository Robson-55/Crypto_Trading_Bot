lkhe5t,1613407341,What is Ethereum ? To beginners and not quite,"Hello redditors,\n\nWe‚Äôve just published a new article dedicated to Ethereum on D.Center ‚Äì I paste it here hoping it could be useful to beginners interested in the asset, and maybe even to some crypto amateurs who could discover new things üòä\n\n***The blockchain aiming at ‚Äúdecentralizing everything‚Äù, Ethereum brings its benefits to numerous domains by enabling complex smart contracts and Dapps.***\n\nDiverse use cases and the absence of an easily customizable blockchain helped formulate a need for a multi-purpose blockchain, on which a wide array of applications could be built. The first to come with a solution was a Russian-Canadian developer Vitalik Buterin, who submitted the Ethereum concept to the crypto community in late 2013. After a successful crowdfunding in 2014 the platform went live by July 2015.\n\nThe major innovation of Ethereum that distinguished it from Bitcoin was a wide range of possible **smart contracts** that could be coded on its blockchain. A smart contract is basically a computer program registered on a blockchain that is executed by the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) when a transaction is sent to its address; the results of a program execution are themselves being stored on a blockchain. The **DApps** (decentralized applications) using these smart contracts enjoy all security and independence benefits of a blockchain: program execution is entrusted to a decentralized network instead of a single third party.\n\n## Ethereum consensus and fees\n\nIn order to incentivize Ethereum nodes to run smart contracts, fees are paid for every transaction. **These fees are paid in a special unit called gas and depend on the amount of computations to be done**. Gas can be bought with Ethereum native currency Ether (ETH), the price being decided by the market according to the supply/demand ratio. \n\nEthereum uses a Proof-of-Work consensus, like Bitcoin, although it has some specificities of its own: hashing function is Ethash and a block is added every 15 seconds. Ethers are generated as a miner‚Äôs reward for adding a block, however there‚Äôs no hard cap on their total emission. Current yearly network issuance is approximately 4.5%, and will be reduced with ETH 2.0\n\n## Ethereum tokens\n\nEthereum is also a very convenient platform for the creation of tokens - digital units circulating on a blockchain and representing a certain value assigned to them by their creator. Its **ERC20** (fungible) and **ERC721** (non-fungible) tokens have become the standards in the industry and are being used extensively.\n\n## DAO\n\nEthereum can be used to build Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). A **DAO is an organization with governance defined by smart contracts registered on a blockchain**. A DAO allows a group of persons to interact using an open source protocol with auto-executing qualities; this protocol and the associated smart contracts formalize the organisation‚Äôs operation rules. Once deployed, a DAO is independent from its creator and isn‚Äôt controlled by an entity, but rather by a consensus between its participants, according to its blockchain-registered code. The owners of tokens associated with a DAO are assigned voting rights and are often rewarded for their participation in the DAO‚Äôs governance.\n\nThe transparency and immutability of the blockchain make such organizations difficult to corrupt, proposing an alternative model to centralized organizations. There are lots of DAO in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance), the most famous being Maker DAO - a lending platform managing the dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI.\n\n## ETH 2.0 and Casper \n\nEthereum relying on a PoW consensus, it has its standard disadvantages: the blockchain is rather slow, costly and energy consuming. To overcome these drawbacks an important update has been planned since Ethereum conception: initially called Serenity and now mostly referred to as **ETH 2.0**, this update has been released in December 2020. It has been deployed on a parallel chain first, in order to conduct all the necessary tests before becoming the main Ethereum chain.\n\nETH 2.0 relies on a consensus called **Casper**, which is a version of the PoS consensus: validator nodes stake a minimum amount of 32 ETH to be able to propose a block or to validate it. The new consensus would also improve the blockchain‚Äôs scalability, allowing a blocktime of just a couple of seconds.\n\nETH 2.0 will also affect the annual Ether emission rate, which will be significantly decreased, or even become negative.\n\n## Ethereum today\n\nEthereum is the most popular blockchain for DApps development, with over 5000 DApps built on it. It is a major blockchain for the Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, with an important new metrics - TVL (Total Value Locked), representing the collateral locked in different types of DeFi applications - exceeding $50 BN worth of crypotoassets. \n\nETH 2.0 is a major ambition for Vitalik Buterin. According to the Ethereum creator, the 4 major problems that need to be solved to push Ethereum to the next level are privacy, consensus safety, smart contract safety, and ‚Ääscalability. Some would add a governance issue to the list, for its role in blockchain‚Äôs life is crucial. \n\nThe original post is available at [https://d.center/en/explore/ethereum](https://d.center/en/explore/ethereum)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lkhe5t/what_is_ethereum_to_beginners_and_not_quite/,1,73

lkibv6,1613409944,Question/Concern surround Proof of Stake.,"So I may have some misunderstandings here and that's why I'm posting to hopefully get some things cleared up.   \n\n\nFrom my understanding becoming a validator through staking is prohibitively expensive, it costs 32ETH where as most cheaper mining rigs can be built for 2-3ETH, which in turn raises the barrier for entry for your average Joe to become a validator which in turn can cause the network to become more centralized.   \n\n\nA few people have stated that PoS pools will form which will allow people to stake as little as 1USD in ETH and not have those people require the upfront 32ETH. What I'm struggling with I suppose is the fact that PoS pools have a much greater risk profile when compared to mining pools. While a mining pool uses your hash to mine and then pays you a share when they achieve a block, if a mining pool acts maliciously and chooses not to pay you your share you can pull your hash rate and either mine solo or find a different pool. Since most pools pay out every 0.05 ETH or 0.1 ETH the losses from joining a bad acting pool are minimal, the pool also doesn't get your hardware so you can also always resell the mining hardware if desired.  \n\n\nWhen it comes to a staking pool you are trusting your currency with an unknown entity, in order to earn the 0.05 ETH I used as an example for the mining pool you would have to risk 0.625 ETH for the duration of a year to earn the 8% interest and earn the 0.05ETH. At any point during that year the staking pool could decide to go dark or run off with the ETH being held without much recourse. How do I stop staking pools from behaving badly and how do I trust them? \n\nUltimately I want a trustless system, but if in order for the system to be trustless I have to stake myself isn't the 32ETH requirement prohibitively expensive?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lkibv6/questionconcern_surround_proof_of_stake/,1,12

I missed out on all of the other RTX 30 series batches and want to make sure I don't miss this one.   \n\n\nI am fairly new to the mining scene and I don't know how to predict the RTX 3060 performances compared to the other ones. I read that ''when **choosing** the **best GPU** for **mining** you should consider core clock, memory, memory clock, power connector, power draw and outputs''. Does boost clock memory count or only base clock? I am thinking that this 3060 will match or surpass a RTX 3070 having a higher memory? See specs in picture.   \n\n\nI didn't take time to compare with AMD equivalent but here's what I found. Is this true according to you? Where would you place the new RTX 3060? : \n\n \n\n* Best Overall. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. See at Best Buy.\n* Best Value. **AMD Radeon RX** 5700 XT. $544 at Amazon.\n* Best Performance. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090. See at Amazon.\n* Best Budget. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER. $312 at Dell.  \n\n\nAlso, having missed out on the other releases, from your own experiences with other RTX models, do you know at what time stores like Newegg and BestBuy make purchases available?
