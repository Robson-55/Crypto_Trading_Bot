lnzdb4,1613796016,Will ethereum fork?,"What are the odds we see a fork when Eth finally moves to POS? Seems like some people might want to keep running the proof of work chain, if for no other reason than to extract some value, like Bitcoin gold did.

lnzhr2,1613796446,My disappointing learning experience practicing Ether transactions,"I have a paper wallet sitting at home with a significant amount of ETH on it. I've got a Ledger Nano X on it's way and want to be 100% sure that I know what I'm doing when the time comes to transfer from the paper wallet to the Ledger Nano X. \n\nTo practice, I figured out how to download My Ether Wallet and run the site offline. I generated a new paper wallet using the site and decided that I'd try sending a small amount to it. After funding my new paper wallet I would then generate an offline transaction using the private key, sign it, and then go back online and send the Ether back to an exchange wallet. This way if I messed up I would only have a small amount of Ether hanging in the balance. Like I said before, I just want to make sure I know exactly what I'm doing for when it comes time to transfer my real balance. I did something very similar  a few times just the other day with Litecoin.\n\nSo I went on to Coinbase and bought $15 worth of Ethereum. I paid a fee of $1.49 which I expected and am never too happy about but whatevs. I plugged in the receiving address for my new paper wallet and hit send. Boom, this is when the current state of the Ethereum network slapped me in the face. ""$3.71 sent"" displays Coinbase. Oh my God! [I just paid $9.93 to send $3.71"" worth of Ether!](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4d24dfd7da9d75cdacfb181f2a49f160f342137596217e0bd13c31b9b0927c39) That means that if I want to successfully follow through with my experiment I'm going to have to buy $20 worth of Ether on Coinbase, pay $10 to send $10 to my wallet so I can have a balance of $13.71, then spend another $10 to move $3.71 to an exchange wallet. $30 to run an experiment to make sure I have peace of mind when sending a large transaction. Wow! I'm not sure if that's worth it or not lol!\n\nWhen I was doing this kind of thing with Litecoin I coughed up maybe 8 cents in transaction fees in total to do this on two different paper wallets. I'm not necessarily salty or anything I just wanted to share what happened because it was a very good learning experience for me. I'm not sure if I'm going to follow through with spending $30 to continue practicing transactions. I'm just going to put all of this on hold and hang onto my original paper wallet lol. \n\nTL;DR Ethereum transaction fees are way higher than I was expecting them to be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lnzhr2/my_disappointing_learning_experience_practicing/,1,33
lnzkq9,1613796743,Exit strategy... maybe time for a new one,"Experienced traders and investors always told me to have an exit strategy and never look back and be happy to have stick with your plan. Few years ago talking with friends we were telling each other what was our price target to exit. I said mine was 2k... now that it is here, I am not too sure anymore, I see the potential for so much more upside but on the other hand that was the plan. I was watching the ticker fly by 2k just earlier and now i am lost. I did sell some in the last bull run and in the following years here and there so im thinking to ride it at least to what my initial bag would of got me at 2k.... all these price predictions of 5k and 10k are driving me nuts, but I also don‚Äôt want to watch it crash and burn just like in 2018 (that was hard to take to be honest) i am traumatized from that bull run lol. \nI needed to vent a bit, i just don‚Äôt want to be glued to my phone 24/7 like 3 yrs ago. But something inside me always told me that patience will reward me and I definitely think that bull run is far from over. I have already cashed out 5-6X my initial investment so no matter what I will never be loosing. Not sure what to fucking do. You guys need to slap me back to common sense!
