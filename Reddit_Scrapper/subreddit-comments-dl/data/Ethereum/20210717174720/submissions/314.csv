l089gu,1611017539,"After the summer of DeFi and with NFT art currently in the spotlight, is gaming the next wave of Ethereum innovation?","I wanted to write a little bit about one of the lesser discussed narratives i've been tracking over at: [r/EthGamers](https://new.reddit.com/r/EthGamers/) which is the story of blockchain gaming.\n\nDuring the network crippling, perfect storm that was the launch of Cryptokitties, the potential and the challenges of blockchain gaming were both abundantly on display.\n\nOn one hand, the concepts of in game item ownership, integrated economics and exciting new partnerships between player communities and developers was emerging, on the other, nobody really knew how this thing was going to work, and what was even possible. Cryptokitties was a great proof of concept, but what was next?\n\nOver the interim years, it's a been a rollercoaster of experimentation - both on the protocol and the application layers - and to be honest, there have been as many misses as there have hits. Even early pioneers like Dapper labs have had to roll with the punches as hard lessons have been learnt.\n\nFundamentally, we're breaking entirely new ground. And while many traditional game studios have taken an interest, and alternatively many crypto enthusiasts have spun up game studios promising the world, the difficulty of combining interesting game mechanics, with integrated economic dynamics is fascinatingly difficult. The broad multi-disciplinary requirement inherent in blockchain gaming development isn't to be underestimated.\n\nWords such as ""play to earn"" were intended to guide us towards an alternative model to the incumbent, broken models of digital asset ownership and gaming, and a range of early explanations of why this was game-changing (""Vitalik lost his warlock, imagine if you could just fork the game and start again"") were often found to be solutions looking for problems, and distractions from the actual work studios were doing to explore and build balanced ""player owned gaming"".\n\nAnd exploring they were - from taking traditional games and adding on item and loot drops, in-game currencies that could be moved to main-chain, scarcity models, pre-sales, fully on-chain gaming, fully-off chain gaming with composability, economic gaming, item rarity, gacha rolls, item ""breeding"", land assets, wealth generating assets, vanity assets, we've got to a point where a lot of things have been attempted, and we're finally starting to see a few of them stick.\n\nThe challenge remains, how do we create a truly fair, enjoyable economic distribution, that can sustainably create an enjoyable game mechanic in the long term? That remains accessible, play-to-earn, and isn't swamped by whales, or early players using their advantage against others. Oh, and after all this, it needs to be a quality (A+) game as well.\n\nWhile DeFi and MemeFi degens were rampaging over summer, almost all trading under a certain amount on OpenSea was quickly subdued by high gas prices. Unless you were moving an exclusive land parcel on Decentraland, or a world class player card on Sorare, it just wasn't worth it. The flux earning and card forging system of God's Unchained had to be put on ice, and Small Love Potions in Axie were no longer worth redeeming regularly.\n\nAnd so the story shifted, the studios put their heads down and had to come up with new solutions, with Matic stepping into the void left by Loom, Axie Infinity investing in their alternative known as Ronin, and Immutable starting the market leading work with Stark labs to create their own scaling alternative: Immutable X. Release date, months not years?\n\nWhile we're still not out of the woods, and it's going to take a few more months of seriously hard work to overcome these scaling challenges, there's definitely something in the air.\n\nAs DeFi and NFT Art finally get their time in the sun after years of similar experimentation, there's a lot on the horizon in terms of the Metaverse (Decentraland, Cryptovoxels, The Sandbox etc.), new innovation (Dark Forest, Immutable X), games using Matic, Enjin and other solutions to overcome scaling challenges today (Neon District, Hash Rush, Ethernal etc.) and those just pushing through with today's gas prices (F1 Delta Time, Brave Frontier Heroes etc.).\n\nOn top of all this, Axie Infinity has been posting some seriously impressive growth numbers, and has an active community of players around the world who are truly using the game to make money week on week.\n\nIt's a small, hardened community of early adopters and like most communities in this space - the longer you've been here, the more scar tissue you've picked up along the way, but i'm fascinated to see where they get to in 2021.

l0em64,1611040104,How does ethereum prevent illegal activity on the blockchain?,"Hi- I bought a couple hundred USD of ether because I believe in the potential of decentralized applications (defi, gaming etc.) wanted to build on the investment. As I was mentally working out use cases for ethereum, I started thinking about how a PoS network can root out illegal activity and I realized I don't nearly understand the network as well as I should. For example - if there is an app that facilitates sharing proprietary trade secrets of companies - how does the network make sure this is booted out? Are we counting on the fact that the participants of the network fear the law enough to selectively terminate that particular dApp? Sorry if this is all over the place? I am not technically well-versed on how the protocol is implemented and I'd appreciate if there is anywhere I could read how this is addressed.
