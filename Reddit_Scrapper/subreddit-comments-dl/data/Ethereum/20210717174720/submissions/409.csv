lp87kf,1613946104,"Mr Buterik, Increase the Block Gas Limit!","Out of control gas prices, are killing the Ethereum ecosystem. Transaction fees have increased by over 1,000% in the past year. On a USD basis, it’s even worse at over 15,000%. This is great for miners and entrenched players, but is killing adoption and slowing down the innovation that will be needed for future price appreciation.\n\n/u/vbuterin and the core team are hard at work on long term scaling solutions in Eth2. But that’s years away. Even EIP-1559 is a minimum of six months. In the meantime, unless the gas costs are addressed, Binance Chain is going to capture a huge amount of the ecosystem. Yes, BSC is far inferior and more centralized. But when you’re looking at paying $1000 to deploy a smart contract to Ethereum versus $1 for BSC, that’s a pretty hard to stomach difference. Pancake Swap has already rocketed past all Ethereum based DeFi protocols.\n\nWe need relief from transition fees *today*. And there’s a dead simple solution: increase the block gas limit. It’s been done many times in the past and even modest increases have always been successful at keeping transaction fees down. It’s simple supply and demand. Larger blocks mean more room for more transactions mean lower prices. Since DeFi makes demand extremely inelastic, we’d expect drastically lower gas prices from even incremental block size increases.\n\nThe argument against increasing the block gas limit is that it makes the requirements for running a full node higher. But right now, the P2P network is extremely healthy, and the number of synced full nodes has never been higher. Whereas nose bleed gas fees are an existential threat to the project. The majority of full nodes run in the cloud, where provisioning more CPU/memory/bandwidth is literally a push of the button. I’ve forked Geth to run blocks as large as 100 million Gwei, and it’s easily handleable for a beefy AWS instance. The current block size is 12.5 million Gwei, the network can easily handle doubling it to 25 million. Rough estimate is that this would cut transaction fees by 80-90%.\n\nPlease, Ethereum core team. Give the small-time ordinary users relief and increase the block size. You’ve done it before. Eth2 is an elegant long-term scalability solution. But don’t let it distract you from simple short-term fixes that would immediately boost the health of the project.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lp87kf/mr_buterik_increase_the_block_gas_limit/,1,27

lpcalp,1613958893,"The biggest security threat to Ethereum is not a 51% attack, it's getting replaced by centralized pseudo-cryptocurrency","The recent post titled [*Binance, a centralized exchange, is taking total advantage of the absurdly high gas fees. And unfortunately they’re doing a damn good job of it.*](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/loy1qe/binance_a_centralized_exchange_is_taking_total/) got me thinking. Most people including me until recenty have been thinking that the high fees on ETH are crazy uncomfortable right now but it doesn't matter long term as it's being worked on and therefore temporary, it's just a ""pause"" in its utility and all the good times will just resume once it's solved by L2, sharding or POS.\n\nThe surge in BNB value is a wake up call, as the OP in the linked thread put it:\n\n&gt; I hate that they are completely CENTRALISED but make themselves seem decentralized. They have complete control over the BNB token. **This is exactly what the crypto community feared and wanted to avoid all along.**\n\nThat's exactly right, that's what we feared and should have feared much more as it gets more real every day. Especially because as another poster put it:\n\n&gt; The open market doesn't give a shit about decentralization. If you don't agree, you're actually in the minority. That's why pancakeswap rocketed to #1. That's why Tether is used to this extent. That's why XRP is top 10. That's why exchanges control over 40% of ETH staking.\n\nThat quote is frightening, it's frightening because it's true. Majority of people in general, be it traders, devs or users do not care about decentralization. And the more people from general population join the crypto space, the more it becomes the reality for that space.\n\n**That's where lies the very real danger for ETH of, not being attacked from within, but being REPLACED and OVERTAKEN by centralized pseudo-coins and once this happens it might stay that way forever given the above!**\n\nUp until now many thought that ETH is far too ahead to be challenged and we can afford a year or two until scaling solutions are deployed, but **BNB showed otherwise, it got 500% closer in *two weeks*, we *do not have* 2 years to solve this! They repeat this feat just ONCE and ETH is no longer the largest smart contract chain in crypto.**\n\nThe fee issue needs to be taken seriously if we want to protect ETH, it's a very real security risk, far bigger at this point than 51% attack, or state growth, uncle rate etc. HALF of Top 10 coins are centralized pseudo-coins, the threat is real not only for ETH but all truly decentralized cryptos. So let's not underestimate it.\n\nWe're bleeding developers, users, future innovation right now. I've seen multiple posts and comments about people abandoning ETH leaving for another chain because of the fees. **Once they have this bad experience and invested time and money in another chain, they're not coming back. This is ""invisible"" at first, that guy who left is going to have his project completed and mature in 3-5 years but it will be too late then when we start to see it more openly, it's no stopping it then.**\n\nAlso when centralized projects close in or overtake ETH even for a while that's when they're going to take full advantage of their centralized nature. **They're going to be making big bucks which are going to go toward troll farms, media, ""influencers"", armies of paid devs and big institutions are going to buy in as they just LOVE centralization. It's also going to be too late once this becomes apparent.** We might end up rambling about it in an obscure corner of the internet, be ETH fanbois that nobody cares or even knows about - it might seem unimaginable now but once this train gets rolling it might end up exactly like that 5-10 years from now, crypto moves at lightspeed.\n\nIf you're thinking that rollups will solve this, think again, L2 is complex and suitable only for a very narrow set of use cases, look at LN on BTC, it totally flopped. Crypto is complex enough, L2 is a level above that and it takes years to make the UX good enough. L2 on ETH breaks composability or makes it complex to the power of 2. **Are we willing to gamble the future of ETH on the hope that L2 gets adopted quickly enough contrary to all experience until now? That carrot has been dangled with SegWit/LN on BTC for years now, let's please not make the same mistake.**\n\nSo what am I proposing? As a first step we need to alleviate the pressure *right now*, that can be done ONLY by raising the block gas limit substantially ASAP, at least double it, ideally quadruple it. We've had time for L2, other scaling solutions a year ago, but that ship has sailed, there is no more time.\n\nIf you're thinking about the drawbacks of raising the limit, think it in a context of a real threat to ETH security - would it be worth it if there was an imminent threat of a 51% attack? Would it be worth to raise the limit to prevent the attack then? Because that's the situation we're in, just more insidious as the damage caused today is going to show itself only in a few years when there is no longer anything we can do about it.\n\nBut I do not think there are any real showstoppers here, uncle rate is at ATL, storage and state growth doesn't matter if we can handle it now as in a few years it will become orders of magnitude easier to handle, for the comuters in 5-10 years it will be just a immaterial blip.\n\nThis will buy us time to develop L2 and rollups, which in turn buys us time for sharding and POS but we NEED to kick the can down the road right now as to stop the bleeding.\n\n**Anyway, if you take anything from this write up, even if you disagree with some suggestions, it's that high fees ARE A SERIOUS SECURITY RISK on par with a 51% attack. And it should be taken just as seriously, by the devs and by the users. Beware and be suspicious of people minimizing that risk (in a reasonable way ofc), troll farms may soon be in full swing and the likes of BNB would like nothing more than for us to underestimate this threat.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lpcalp/the_biggest_security_threat_to_ethereum_is_not_a/,3,398
