m3b95e,1615528723,FUD about crypto being a Ponzi scheme.,"After watching plenty of videos on crypto and all the negative talk, it has made me feel in the FUD trap. What is the counterargument against this? the people who get in early get rich while the new investors hold the bag. I believe that ETH puts the currency into use which makes it have more value behind it than the people's mania.

m3fdxr,1615547375,Ethereumâ€™s layer 2 and EIP1559 solutions in comparison to Cardanoâ€™s network,"TLDR\n\nLayer 2 solutions: These are several solutions that donâ€™t run on the main net and improve Ethereumâ€™s scalability and transaction speed. A way of imagining these solutions is like the highways that take traffic off the main net to reduce congestion. However, fees have to be paid when transferring from layer 1 to layer 2, so fees could remain high if congestion is high.\n\nEIP1559: Establishes the market rate for transactions, so people donâ€™t have to guess the gas fee. In addition, the majority of Ethereum is burned in the transaction, which creates a deflationary mechanism. Gas fees are determined by congestion, so they could remain high. \n\nDiscussion \n\nThere seems to be lots of hype behind these two solutions at the moment on the internet fixing Ethereumâ€™s high gas fees. However, I donâ€™t see these two solutions actually fixing the high gas feeâ€™s on Ethereum if congestion remains high on the main net. It will only really work if people start using the layer 2 solutions and choose not to convert their transaction back into Ethereum?
