Pushed the transaction. 1hour later I realized that its different address and only first 4 symbols are same. Somehow my copy-paste buffer changed the address from right one to wrong one.\n\nMoney lost. No way to recover it. Please dont repeat my mistake do not blindly trust to copy-paste buffer , your computer could be infected with malware that swaps addresses and it will be too late when you realize that.\n\nP.S:\n\nSince Coinbase not showing whole address and first 4 symbols were the same it was very easy to overlook\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wge4vg7hbaj51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c43acdbcf49c4829b3e1fd30597019381d9cf10",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/igt8ez/warningplease_guys_be_extremely_careful/,1,230
