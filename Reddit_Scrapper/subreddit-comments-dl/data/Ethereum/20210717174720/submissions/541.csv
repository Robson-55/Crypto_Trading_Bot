mvdrk2,1619005079,Is the Ethereum protocol exhibiting predatory behavior? A Wednesday morning hype thread.,"\n\n\nIt‚Äôs 1996. Google is two years from founding. Amazon is reselling books. Video streaming is possible, if you own a 56k modem, live in a major city, are rich, and possess the technical know how to complete the several steps. President Clinton is ‚Äú[B]uilding that bridge to the year two-*tha*sand.‚Äù\n\nGood old ‚Äò96, Tupac has been shot dead and the three largest companies listed on any US stock exchange (by market cap) are car manufacturers: GM, Ford, and Chrysler, respectively. Yeah, that‚Äôs hard to believe. \n\nWe‚Äôve talked about *fat protocol thesis* on this sub previously. So for those that know what it is, bear with me again while I briefly explain it for those that don‚Äôt: \n\n*The internet is a protocol. Value flows from its protocol to its applications. Google, Amazon, etcetera are its applications. Over time, they‚Äôve become valuable. In cryptocurrency protocols however, value flows in the opposite direction, from the application layer to the protocol. Thus the name: fat protocol theory. Yes it‚Äôs just a theory, but so is gravity. It‚Äôs easy then, to imagine why Ethereum is uniquely positioned amongst its competition to capture so much value, because of all that‚Äôs built on it, its ecosystem. \n\nWhat‚Äôs interesting about the internet and its applications capturing value, is that we didn‚Äôt see that really begin until the late 90s. In the early-mid 90s, things were only arranging or jockeying themselves to an unknown future, so obvious to us now. And remember the ferocious competition? Anyone? That‚Äôs a book itself. Most of the companies went bankrupt, some merged, others were bought out. The ones that survived are global household names. \n\nIt‚Äôs difficult to avoid then, comparing Ethereum and cryptocurrencies to this time period, because it‚Äôs mirroring it in lockstep. Ah the 90s. Remember its tech rockstars? Of course you do, they‚Äôre still around imposing their will in various ways. In crypto we have one living rockstar (unless Satoshi is alive): Vitalik Buterin. And that‚Äôs...not insignificant either folks, not in the culture we live in, not for Ethereum‚Äôs early days. For the younger people out there, what‚Äôs happening in crypto now is basically your chance to live, in some telling, the 90s tech boom, from which half of the top 10 wealthiest US people come:\n\n - Bezos\n - Gates\n - Page\n - Ellison\n - Brin\n\nSo don‚Äôt squander it watching on the sidelines. It‚Äôs still so new. Yolo in.\n\nLet‚Äôs consider the last crypto bull cycle. Question: What crypto‚Äôs that were top ten in 2017, are top ten now? Only two: BTC and ETH (LTC is in and out of the top ten on any given week, having fallen 6 places from what was historically an unshakeable #3 position). But here‚Äôs the curious thing: if we expand that list to say the top 50, how many are ERC tokens? 33 are. The Ethereum network is starting to arrange and position itself. They [ERC tokens] now dominate the mid-tier of that list and are moving relentlessly upwards. USDC and ChainLink for example (both ERC), could break into the top ten soon. That would put three ERC tokens (ETH, LINK, USDC) in the top ten, and that is much more substantial than people think. How about visualizing the data in a different way: if we use the total crypto mkt cap which is approximately $2T, we see the entire Ethereum ecosystem makes up $500B or 25% of it. That‚Äôs more than a double percentage gain (almost triple actually) what it was in 2017. Bitcoin and Tether have a top ten relationship too. But USDC now has a mkt cap ~28% of Tether‚Äôs and gaining fast. Why is this happening? That was unthinkable just two years ago. And about BTC, the wrapped version (WBTC, an ERC token) is top 20 and moving up. That‚Äôs predatory, because the Ethereum Network is finding solutions to chew on things not natively built on it. Now, Ethereum will never eat Bitcoin anymore than Bing will eat Google (but Bing only exists because of antitrust laws), so a better analogy might be what email did to the USPS‚Äîdidn‚Äôt kill it, but syphoned its small cost efficient property. I won‚Äôt even bother getting into the NFT market because it‚Äôs too nascent, but again, Ethereum is positioned to add this predatory wrinkle better than any other. Our century is young, and in these early days of crypto, unless you‚Äôre named BTC, innovation lag will kill you. \n\nWhat‚Äôs my point? My point is that like the internet and its value flow, the Ethereum protocol isn‚Äôt past 1996 yet. I don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre seeing *fat protocol thesis* at work...not yet. And that‚Äôs a subject to ponder, because heretofore, there‚Äôs been a belief that it is. It‚Äôs important to add, that many scholars believe the thesis to be wrong and unprovable, including my economics professor. They‚Äôre right too, but only because the timeline data is too small, the thesis hasn‚Äôt had time to develop (as opposed to grow), because Amazon is still reselling books, AWS (Amazon Web Services Cloud) hasn‚Äôt democratized starting a small online business, Google doesn‚Äôt exist, ruthless competition is still killing things before they begin because the young galaxy is still full of space rocks, and global users are a small landlocked lake, not oceans yet...there‚Äôs less than 1M *active* Ethereum wallets.\n\nMy other point is that one has to wonder with trends so linear, wether holding anything besides Bitcoin, ERC, or privacy coin is worth it. I‚Äôm unconvinced, which is why I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôd also be concerned about how many potential major ETF‚Äôs are now considering structuring themselves: instead of an *Ethereum ETF* made of ETH, they‚Äôll be made of a rotational basket of the Ethereum Network‚Äôs top tokens. Too, when some ETF‚Äôs start offering baskets of all crypto‚Äôs, how many ERC tokens do you imagine will be in there if current trends hold?\n\n\nRemember the top three US companies we talked about in 1996? Well, by the early 2000‚Äôs, tech companies (what we defined earlier as internet applications) began dominating the mid-tier list of largest US companies, some making it quite high. And integrated oil-majors (Exxon, Chevron, etc) replaced the car companies as the largest by mkt cap, you know the ones selling the *gas*? No point here actually, besides the pun. \n\nNote: I promise I‚Äôll try bringing this all around to make sense. So let‚Äôs continue this senseless ramble: \n\nAfter the 2008 economic crisis (which lasted some years) an unexpected group of companies staged a sudden move up the mkt cap rankings: Banks. Why? Quantitative Easing, zero percent interest rates, and loose central bank monetary policy on a global scale. It‚Äôs no coincidence that at this same time, Bitcoin came into existence. But, those damn longterm *internet applications* accruing value...\n\nRight, so fast-forward to today. Go to your brokerage and find the top companies by market cap on any stock exchange. What are they? Bingo:\n\n - Apple\n - Microsoft\n - Amazon\n - Alphabet \n - Google\n - Facebook\n\nThey‚Äôve all finally made it. The difference is, they‚Äôre unlikely to be replaced by anything unrelated. They shouldn‚Äôt be. Not for a generation, right? Wrong. Most will be replaced from the top spots because they‚Äôll be weakened by a DAO Web 3.0 predator that syphons, feeds, borrows, steals, learns, wraps, experiments, fails, merges, digitizes, and innovates at a pace that‚Äôs impossible to keep up with. And for good measure, add in the fact that it began as, and is unified with finance. **Its imagination will never overreach its supply of money.** On a global scale, that‚Äôs insane. At least that‚Äôs the longterm view of Ethereum. What replaces the top company‚Äôs spots is anyone‚Äôs guess. If it‚Äôs Boston Dynamics I‚Äôll know the end is near. If it‚Äôs a green energy breakthrough I‚Äôll have hope. \n\n\nThanks for reading. Just wanted to try cleaning my mind this morning. Now for some fun predictions a couple years out dealing with finance bits:\n\n - Ethereum‚Äôs gas fees fall and staking becomes available to the masses (both promises of 2.0)\n\n - Hindsight data shows DeFi eroding chartered bank margins\n\n - Central banks are forced to combat China‚Äôs digital Yuan threat by rolling out their own digital fiat much faster than we thought\n\n -Bitcoin captures 50% of gold‚Äôs $10T mkt cap \n\n - Fat protocol thesis is finally set loose\n\n - ERC tokens comprise 13 of the top 20 token spots. \n\n - DeFi friction collapses and with it the learning curve\n\n - Country‚Äôs banks compete for global retail borrowing undercutting Ethereum‚Äôs staking rewards APY by 3% or more in some places\n\n - Cryptocurrency makes the platform of both major US political parties \n\n - Digital fiat captures the stablecoin business and Tether collapses from their front end integration allowing the Ethereum Network (all ERC tokens combined) to make a run on Bitcoin‚Äôs mkt cap\n\n - Volatility continues to dissipate and wild speculation is gone, the global confidence curve of crypto is flat, longterm deflationary appreciation begins and ‚Äúmargin capture‚Äù of what were once traditional bank margins (profits) is the new speculation as YOU become the bank\n\n - Two major US banks consolidate/merge \n\n - Ethereum‚Äôs next major upgrade hype is an on-chain oracle \n\n - US Treasury sets up probate crypto address \n\n - London is no longer the world‚Äôs forex Capitol, their failure to adapt to crypto and their innovation lag is devastating\n\n - ENS (Ethereum Name Service) finally gets its act together allowing WEB 3.0 to begin in earnest \n\n - The forbidden coin (XMR) has its day entering the top ten as atomic swaps and privacy premiums spike value after decentralized platforms begin (ever so) softly merging with legacy finance\n\n - Manned moon mission data inadvertently raises serious questions about the veracity of previous manned moon missions",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mvdrk2/is_the_ethereum_protocol_exhibiting_predatory/,1,76

mve7gy,1619006694,It's Earth Day. How Can Ethereum Achieve Carbon Neutrality in the Future?,"Unlike many other blockchains, the Ethereum community has been proactive about its carbon footprint by moving to a Proof of Stake model. While this is a necessary step, the ultimate goal needs to be carbon neutrality. The logical solution for long-term scalability in this aspect would be to implement carbon credits into the cost of performing transactions to offset the energy usage needed to process these transactions.\n\nI came across a new project creating a protocol to offset all carbon emissions generated by cryptocurrency transactions. Dovu ([https://www.dovu.earth/](https://www.dovu.earth/)) allows any other project to use its system to make their network carbon neutral. Ocean Protocol announced this morning they would be partnering with them for this purpose. The project uses Hedera Hashgraph to issue tokenized carbon credits to any carbon emitter to fund carbon-negative activities, such as soil sequestration by farmers. There is a nice write-up on the Hedera website: [https://hedera.com/users/dovu](https://hedera.com/users/dovu).\n\nIf this is the route we will take to become carbon neutral, adding a carbon tax to transaction fees would help the most energy efficient networks and could make the least efficient networks too expensive to use. Of course, energy inefficient networks could resist doing anything at all to reduce their carbon footprint. But once we have blockchains that can provably claim to be carbon neutral using something like Dovu, I think the people of the world will make the right choice and transact where they know the environmental impact will be neutralized. Any network that cannot achieve carbon neutrality will be marginalized in favor of ones that can.\n\nWith Eth 2.0 expected to cut the network's energy consumption by 99%, we are on a good path. However as we all know we are still extremely early as far as mass adoption, with less than 100,000 unique dApp users each day most days. Even with a 99% drop in energy consumption, as adoption accelerates we will be forced to face the environmental impact of the ETH network. The only way to ensure the long term viability of the network from an environmental perspective is to have a provable method of carbon offset applied to every use of the network.\n\nTLDR: ETH needs to adopt a roadmap to achieve carbon neutrality at some point in the future to remain viable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mve7gy/its_earth_day_how_can_ethereum_achieve_carbon/,1,38
