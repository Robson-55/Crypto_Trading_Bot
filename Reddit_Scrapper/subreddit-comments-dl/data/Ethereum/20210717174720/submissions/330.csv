Once done, they will start earning YPF tokens as reward.\n\nThe list of eligible LP tokens can be added per on-chain governance.\n\nAt every block, 150 YPF tokens will be created. These tokens will be equally distributed to the stakers of each of the supported pools.\n\n   \n \n\n**Important!** As the introductory launch offer, the platform will generate 4x more YPF rewards per block (600 YPF) during the first 7 days after launch, divided by the proportional share of the pool. The exception to this will be ‚ÄúYPRO/YPRO‚Äù pool which will have a 4x proportional share as compared to other pools.

l5hbt9,1611678004,I have some concerns about Ethereum which i haven't seen many people cover yet.,"This post is about fees but not about the current gas price. This is a concern I have about L2s. \n\nBefore I start I feel obligated to say I'm not recommending any ghost chains here, I just want to discuss something i've been a little worried about.\n\nRight now the gas price goes up when people are willing to pay a higher gwei to get their transaction to go through and the gas price drops when less people are willing to pay the current price. This is classic supply and demand.\n\nMy concern is that once L2s become popular, the gas prices on L1 could increase exponentially.\n\nLet's say market limit on how much people are willing to pay for gas is 500 gwei for example, L2's like optimism allow people to pay 1/150 of the L1 gas price. So the gas price on L1 could be 1000 gwei, while the price on optimism is still 6 gwei. \n\nWe could run into a situation where the market within L2s are pumping their gas price up to 50/100/500 gwei, making the gas price on L1..\n\n50 gwei in L2 = 7500 gwei on L1\n\n100 gwei in L2 = 15,000 gwei on L1\n\n500 gwei in L2 =  75,000 gwei on L1\n\nThis would make it virtually impossible for 99% of people to deposit into a L2 because the deposit is an L1 transaction.\n\nTLDR; L2's offering 150 times cheaper gas prices could make L1 gas price pump to insane heights.\n\nI understand Ethereum phase 1 would massively help remove this issue as L2s will have 62 times more head space thanks to being able to store data on Eth 2 chain. This certainly isn't a long term issue, just something I'm concerned about if Uniswap, snx and chainlink suddenly gain loads of users on L2 before phase 1.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l5hbt9/i_have_some_concerns_about_ethereum_which_i/,1,0

It's great for getting your application ready for mainnet  (scheduled for late Q1 or early Q2 2021).\n\nFor  those new to the technology, Ceramic is a public, permissionless,  censorship-resistant network for managing mutable information on the  open internet. By combining a stack of cutting-edge web3 technologies  including IPFS, libp2p, blockchain, DIDs, and authenticated  (signed/encrypted) data standards, Ceramic gives developers the ability  to build completely serverless applications using dynamic, verifiable,  decentralized data. Ceramic can be used with any blockchain and currently supports Ethereum, Filecoin, Cosmos, EOS, with Polkadot and others coming soon.\n\nAlong with this announcement, [**IDX**](https://idx.xyz/),  a protocol for cross-platform decentralized identity and interoperable  user data built on top of Ceramic has entered beta. The IDX SDK is a  useful tool for adding decentralized identity functionality to your  already existing application, and is an easy entry point to get started  with Ceramic. IDX currently runs on the Clay testnet, so it has the same  guarantees as Ceramic and will move to production when mainnet  launches.\n\n\--\n\nTo learn more about the Clay testnet, read the [**official announcement**](https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/) or our [**twitter thread**](https://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork/status/1354448316512284675?s=20).\n\nTo get started, try the [**demo app**](https://playground.ceramic.dev/) and jump into the [**docs**](https://developers.ceramic.network/build/quick-start/).",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l6b1vl/ceramic_network_clay_testnet_is_officially_live/,2,0

Through this partnership, we will be increasing our commitment to blockchain, accelerating scaling and resources for the Ethereum ecosystem, and bringing the value and independence of blockchain technology to millions of redditors.\n\nIn many ways, this collaboration started with the [Scaling Bake-Off](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) that we hosted in this community with the Ethereum Foundation. In this new stage of our partnership, immediate efforts will be focused on bringing Ethereum to Reddit-scale production. Our intention is to help accelerate the progress being made on scaling and develop the technology needed to launch large-scale applications like Community Points on Ethereum. The scaling technology developed through this partnership will be open-sourced and publicly available for anyone to use.\n\nWe introduced [Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/) last year to give more ownership and control back to users through decentralized technology. Built on Ethereum, Community Points represent a user‚Äôs ownership in a community and rewards them for their individual contributions (such as posts and comments). This project is our first attempt at utilizing decentralized technology to empower individuals to have a sense of accountability and more ownership in the communities that they create and contribute to. Community Points are currently in beta on the Rinkeby network and are being tested in [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) and [r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/).\n\nOur blockchain efforts will be led by Reddit's Crypto team (hi!). We are currently [hiring](https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/2419120) great backend engineers who want to build the decentralized Internet. If you‚Äôre interested in solving tough problems like scaling and bringing blockchain to millions of users, send me a PM or apply directly on Reddit‚Äôs careers page -- we‚Äôd love to talk to you!\n\nWe‚Äôre looking forward to working closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and contributing more to the broader Ethereum ecosystem -- and we hope to share some exciting announcements over the next few months. I'll be hanging around with a couple of folks from the Ethereum Foundation to answer questions.
