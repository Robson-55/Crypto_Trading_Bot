n2o3m1,1619893384,How does everyone feel about buying ETH through paypal?,"I didnt know Paypal offered ETH til the other day. I threw $100 in it and plan to continue to do a $100 or 200 here and there every now and then. Ive always been pretty sketchy on crypto and just buy index funds and stuff. I feel like getting ripped off by paypal is highly unlikely but i understand the ""not your wallet, not your keys"" thing. For a very small time ETH investor do you think this is ok, or should i use binance, kraken, etc?\n\nAlso. What is the best exchange in your opinion? Ive followed crypto for a long time but always thought it was too volatile for my liking. Open to suggestions.

I have been holding my ETH in staking apps like Celsius, BlockFi, Nexo, etc. However, now that Coinbase is offering ETH 2.0 at 6% I am tempted to move to it. My highest APY of ETH as of today is on Celsius @ 5.05%. I was getting 5.25% on my ETH at BlockFi up until today, but they dropped their rates a lot, so I'll be dropping them (just BTW). \n\nI am a long term HODL'r that bought ETH back in Fall of 2017 and don't plan on sell any for years to come.
