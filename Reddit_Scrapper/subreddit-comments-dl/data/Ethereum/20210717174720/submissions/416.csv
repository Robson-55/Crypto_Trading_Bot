My assumption is less but I don't understand the full picture.\n\nThank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lqkfoe/gas_and_eth_20/,42,93

lql4cg,1614094439,Eli5 for the tech behind mining and staking?,"Because of how often Bitcoin and other cryptos have been in the news lately, I became aware of just how massive the power consumption of the Bitcoin network was (using more energy than Switzerland apparently).  Through wanting to learn  more about this issue, and possible solutions, I discovered that the Ethereum network may solve this issue with Eth2 and staking.\n\nHowever, I really don't understand the technology behind staking and how it can replace mining.  I still don't perfectly understand mining, but I think I understand that it just takes a lot of computational power to verify network transactions, and that verifying gives rewards in the form of fees and new coins entering circulation.\n\nIs my understanding of mining accurate?  How does staking accomplish the same thing while consuming less energy?\n\nI will say it has been very interesting to learn about the Ethereum network so far.  I had always thought it was just like another form of Bitcoin, but it seems like it has the potential to be so much more than that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lql4cg/eli5_for_the_tech_behind_mining_and_staking/,1,2
