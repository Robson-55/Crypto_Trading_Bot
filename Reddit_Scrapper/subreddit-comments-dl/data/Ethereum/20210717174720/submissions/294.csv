ktygu8,1610223357,Question about trustless smart contracts,"I've been thinking a lot about trustless business transactions using Ethereum.\n\nLet's say I am a manufacturer selling smart phones to a large retailer. I have a good reputation doing business with a retailer. In the past, I have always delivered what the retailer has asked for. Let's say I have many times manufactured smart phones that cost my company $4,800,000 to produce, and I have always sold these orders for $5,000,000 to large retailers, with a profit of $200,000 per order.\n\nAfter years of doing business, I am ready to retire. I send a box full of paperweights that weigh and look the same as the smart phones I have delivered to the retailer over the years. The currier confirms that the retailer received the goods. My money goes to the retailer via the smart contract.\n\nIf I receive fake goods, what is my recourse as a retailer? The contract has already paid the manufacturer. The currier says the order was received by me, you can't expect a currier the inspect every sealed box and know what they're looking for.\n\nIn this case, wouldn't I, as the retailer, need a legal entity to sue the manufacturer? Doesn't this defeat the purpose of a trustless system?\n\nPlease explain that I'm wrong. I want to invest in ethereum but I wonder whether this has all been and accounted for somehow. What am I missing here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ktygu8/question_about_trustless_smart_contracts/,1,0

Someone says **geth**. Gross, it has a fucking installer. No standalone. At least it extracts with 7zip. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand nope it's garbage; just command line shit.\n\nSee **WallETH** suggested. Shit tier interface. Can't even back out of it as it just loops on itself. \n\nSomeone says **metamask**. Hmm no proper Windows client either and I don't trust crypto management as a browser plugin. Ok fine lets try another android client. Can only access with 12 word seed. No option for private key and for whatever reason I only have a pass phrase for ETC not ETH stored in my old keepass entry for it.\n\n**Jaxx.io**, another fucking installer. God forbid I get a standalone portable client. Can't extract this one. Cool. Pass.\n\nFuck it, we'll go old school, **myetherwallet**. Nope, site loads as a blank on desktop browsers.\n\n    ReferenceError: BigInt is not defined[Learn More]\n\nThe hardest part in finding a way to access and manage funds is finding something trustworthy. Once found, it has to actually work and be user friendly. So far ethereum is failing.\n\nElectrum is stupid simple, offers a nice portable version which once I am satisfied is safe I can throw in a truecrypt container and have it handy, and it beats the shit out of all these products.
