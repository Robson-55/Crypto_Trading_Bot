iqb9tq,1599768754,When scalening?,"I really like Ethereum and when someone asks, I always explain the ‚Äûblockchain-possibilities‚Äú with Ethereum, not BTC. While recommending ETH I always send some ETH(fractions) to some guys for showing  ‚Äûhow simple it is‚Äú. Today I was shocked to see a 5 USDish fee inside my Blockchain app - just for sending to a simple address. \n\nMy question: What do you expect: when will wallet apps make use of ‚Äû2nd layers‚Äú to transfer ETH with more speed/much lower fees? I heard of so many 2nd layer solutions - but it seems that noone uses it. Just curious.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/iqb9tq/when_scalening/,1,79
