l9n1bn,1612130006,How will newcomers earn Ether after the docking of Eth2.0?,"Please correct me if I am mistaken, but don't a lot of newcomers to crypto come because they already have computers with the ability to start mining small amounts of coin? How will this work under a Proof of Stake concept? If I am a layperson who is interested in getting started with crypto that uses PoS, I will have to purchase some ether (or mine another coin, and trade) before I join a staking pool, whereas with PoW crypto you can begin earning coin right away. Wouldn't this make it *less* likely for increasing accessibility? I often see the argument that becoming a validator is more accessible than becoming a miner because of the small amount of resources required opposed to PoW. Also, if PoS takes over as the dominant concept over PoW in the crypto world, and mining becomes a thing of the past -- wouldn't the only way to stake would be to convert Fiat to crypto?\n\nI tried to do as much research as possible, I wish there was a super long FAQ I could fine this question in, but I guess the only place I would find that is deeply buried in some forum somewhere",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l9n1bn/how_will_newcomers_earn_ether_after_the_docking/,3,28
