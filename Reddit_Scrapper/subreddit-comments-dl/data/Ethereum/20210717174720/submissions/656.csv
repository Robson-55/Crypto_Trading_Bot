nau6qg,1620840188,A different perspective on the gas fees that points to more value on the network,"I know a lot of people have been complaining about the gas fees lately, but it seems like most of the conversation around this topic deals with the potential over congestion of the network at times and not taking into account other factors. \n\nYes, congestion will increase gas but another big factor is the price of ETH as well. After all, the gas fees are paid in ETH. So, although the gas fee price increases in our trash fiat as the value of ETH skyrockets, the actual fee in ETH seems to be hovering around the same margins over time. \n\nJust another thing to think about, especially since most of this stuff is related to FUD. From the perspective of its raw ETH value, increasing gas fees in USD is just an indicator effect of the network accruing increasingly more value.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nau6qg/a_different_perspective_on_the_gas_fees_that/,1,6

naunyr,1620841409,Why ASIC resistance is a concern in Ethereum community?,I understand ASIC resistance is touted up to reign in Miners. But as a EE i feel that its as fruitless as Trumps attempt to build a wall.

nauq9g,1620841572,Previously shutdown exchange coinexchange.io back 18th May? Chance to get lost ETH coins back or scam??,"Hoping someone can help. I, like many others was caught out and lost a significant amount of ETH, DOGE and VGX when the coinexchange.io exchange shutdown in 2019. See news article here: https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2019/10/01/crypto-exchange-coinexchange-io-is-closing-down/\nThey received quite a bit of criticism about not informing their users of their shutdown by email, instead just posting a few tweets about it. As such, alot of crypto users lost a significant amount of coins (particularly alt coins, which is what I lost, since they had a significant list of the more obscure coins on their exchange.)\nI assumed that these were lost to the internet in 2019, however by chance I checked their website today and noticed that there was a new notice posted that they will provide a short window to users to log back in and secure their coins on 18th May 2021. See photo and website.\nDoes anyone know if this is legit? There is a potential scam here whereby someone could have bought the now expired domain name, posted a fake notice on behalf of the ex-company, will provide a login page, and hope that users will login using their typical crypto passwords on 18th May, and tricking users into giving up their passwords/logins for potentially other exchanges?\nCoinexchange.io's official twitter account has no mention of this new release of login access which is on its own very strange, the whole thing seems quite suspicious to me?
