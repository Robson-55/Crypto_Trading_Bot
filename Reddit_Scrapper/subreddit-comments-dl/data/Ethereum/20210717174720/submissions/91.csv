i17rqg,1596203172,Where do I go to build a team?,"Hey guys, I have an idea of how to tokenize stocks on the blockchain in such a way that they would be tradeable on a dex like uniswap, and (relatively) stable with their current assets on wallstreet. \n\nThe project would have access to stake roughly 80% of all eth that is contributed, and would a have a clean unwind mechanism to allow investors to get their ethereum back at the same rate they bought the shares for. \n\nThe project would be for profit, and would do to stocks what tether did to us dollars. Revenue generation comes from staking eth that was paid to project, as well as minor entrance fees ($15 or 1%, whichever is less).\n\nThis project allows investors and traders to get exposure to the stock market using their ethereum as collateral. Currently, the only way to do this is to take out a crypto loan, and then buy stocks with the crypto loan. This creates a situation where the investor has to pay interest on their loan, and does not have the option to cleanly unwind if they lose on the stock market. My project fixes that, and creates a way for an investor to have no risk on the ethereum side of their holdings, along with no lost interest fees. \n\nI would like to put together a team of coders, angel investors, and privacy experts to develop the smart contracts and infrastructure for this project.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/i17rqg/where_do_i_go_to_build_a_team/,1,4

i19us9,1596210644,OMG Network's Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off Proposal,"&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img pld4qb1yp7e51...*\n\nLate last month, Reddit announced The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off, an open-invitation competition calling all Ethereum scaling projects to show the community a scaling solution that can be used to bring Community Points to mainnet.\n\nOnce we decided to take up the challenge we had one goal in mind: to build a live and scalable application that our 43K strong Reddit community\* can use to transfer ROCKs (community points) on our subreddit in real-time — all while fulfilling the technical requirements laid out by the Reddit team.\n\nIt took us less than 30 days to achieve our goal.\n\n# Introducing the Community Points Engine by OMG Network\n\nThe [Community Points Engine (CPE) powered by OMG Network](https://omg.network/reddit-bakeoff-scaling-community-points/) is a Chrome Extension that allows for fee-less and near-real-time value transfer while browsing the OMG Network subreddit. Users can transfer points without entering the receiver’s wallet address; the extension automatically extracts it for you, making transfers fluid and easy.  \n\n\n*Processing video 1a0w2vqkm7e51...*\n\nBut the CPE is not only built with the subreddit subscriber in mind, the tool serves all types of Reddit users. So if you’re a moderator, you can immediately mint and distribute points to anybody on the subreddit, as well as burn points and handle all admin actions with a user-friendly dashboard. If you’re a Reddit team member, you can rest assured knowing that the OMG Network can withstand the traffic threshold that Reddit requires thanks to our MoreViable Plasma Technology.\n\nIt’s no secret that designing for simplicity is hard, but simple is desirable, and that’s why it was our priority with this application. Because while we understand and appreciate the value of trustlessness in technology, the concept, and the feature is inherently complicated. We want the CPE to be something everyone can use, and will only highlight ‘technical’ elements when necessary.\n\n# Checking All The Boxes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 1d9588q4n7e51...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Usable:** The Community Point interface allows users to make fee-less transactions just like they would through a regular app. The integration is seamlessly built into the current subreddit browsing experience.\n* **Scalable:** OMG Network’s MoreViable Plasma design is capable of handling thousands of transactions per second. The new fee-relayer design also allows point providers to manage funds and settle multiple fee-less transactions at the same time.\n* **Interoperable:** Never build products in a vacuum. The solution is fully compatible with existing wallets such as Metamask. In fact, interoperability is so important to us that we’ve integrated a third-party provider — [CurveGrid’s MultiBaaS](https://docs.omg.network/3rd-party/multibaas) — as part of the solution itself.\n* **Secure:** We take software security seriously. The underlying network is trustless and non-custodial. This means users have full ownership over their points even if the network faces issues. Our solution also takes advantage of secure key management standards like Hardware Security Module.\n* **Decentralized:** No need to trust the operator, our Watcher software and Plasma protocol ensure nobody has to put their trust on one central point of failure\n\n# A Few Words on What We Care About\n\nThe blockchain ecosystem is well on its way to mainstream adoption and large-scale applications like Reddit are beginning to look at trustless technology to solve real problems. The time for experimentation and theoretical design is over; it’s time for production-ready software to take center stage.\n\nWe standby what we’ve accomplished in the past 30 days and consider this challenge as a great way to showcase the OMG Network and our seriousness as a team. We approached the Great Reddit Bake-Off as we would any client project, leaving no stone unturned when it came to delivering a well- designed, well-documented, and well-developed solution.\n\nThe Bake-Off’s specs are descriptive, but we know that great software is much more than that. It is a collaboration between client and solution provider. We look forward to upcoming iterations and hope to discover and work towards Reddit’s real needs so that we can design the right type of infrastructure for their application.\n\nNonetheless, a competition like this goes to show how mature the Layer-2 space has become over the past few years. As we advance as a company, we’ll be sure to design, develop, and iterate on our product and look to see other projects grow from theoretical design to a complete product.\n\nFinally, software is not done because we've met the deadline. There is always room for improvement. Over the next few days we will be inviting you all in to help us test the CPE Chrome Extension on our new subreddit: [r/omgnetwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/omgnetwork).\n\n# Find Out More\n\nIf you’d like to dig deeper into the CPE to understand the full architecture of the solution, visit the links below:\n\n1.

Anyone, anywhere, at any time, can move tokens in and out of the Fuel chain, transfer them, and more. The maximum transaction throughput of Fuel is currently around **500tps**. Transactions are faster, cheaper, and still fully decentralized.\n\n[Fuel Labs](https://fuel.sh/) is the world leader in trustless and permissionless blockchain scaling. Our team has pioneered the design of optimistic rollups, which enable dynamic heterogeneous sharding on Ethereum *today* for massive scalability without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThe Fuel rollup chain is specifically optimized to maximize transaction throughput without proportionally increasing the cost of running a full node. It is the most scalable optimistic rollup chain in the world, and is designed to enable the original use case of blockchains: unstoppable digital payments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Jump Into ""Fuel Plays Pokémon"" Immediately\n\n1.

i1ct52,1596220263,Syscoin Platform’s Great Reddit Scaling Bake-off Proposal,"&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](rqt2dldyg8e51)\n\nWe are excited to participate and present Syscoin Platform's ideal characteristics and capabilities towards a well-rounded Reddit Community Points solution!\n\nOur scaling solution for Reddit Community Points involves 2-way peg interoperability with Ethereum. This will provide a scalable token layer built specifically for speed and high volumes of simple value transfers at a very low cost, while providing sovereign ownership and onchain finality.\n\nToken transfers scale by taking advantage of a globally sorting mempool that provides for probabilistically secure assumptions of “as good as settled”. The opportunity here for token receivers is to have an app-layer interactivity on the speed/security tradeoff (99.9999% assurance within 10 seconds). We call this Z-DAG, and it achieves high-throughput across a mesh network topology presently composed of about 2,000 geographically dispersed full-nodes. Similar to Bitcoin, however, these nodes are incentivized to run full-nodes for the benefit of network security, through a bonded validator scheme. These nodes do not participate in the consensus of transactions or block validation any differently than other nodes and therefore do not degrade the security model of Bitcoin’s *validate first then trust,* across every node. Each token transfer settles on-chain. The protocol follows Bitcoin core policies so it has adequate code coverage and protocol hardening to be qualified as production quality software. It shares a significant portion of Bitcoin’s own hashpower through [merged-mining](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification). \n\nThis platform as a whole can serve token microtransactions, larger settlements, and store-of-value in an ideal fashion, providing probabilistic scalability whilst remaining decentralized according to Bitcoin design. It is accessible to ERC-20 via a permissionless and trust-minimized bridge that works in both directions. The bridge and token platform are currently available on the Syscoin mainnet. This has been gaining [recent attention](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684900781/Binance-Blockchain-Foundry-Work-Together-for-Wider-BUSD-Access) for use by loyalty point programs and stablecoins such as Binance USD.\n\n# Solutions\n\nSyscoin Foundation identified a few paths for Reddit to leverage this infrastructure, each with trade-offs. The first provides the most cost-savings and scaling benefits at some sacrifice of token autonomy. The second offers more preservation of autonomy with a more narrow scope of cost savings than the first option, but savings even so. The third introduces more complexity than the previous two yet provides the most overall benefits. We consider the third as most viable as it enables Reddit to benefit even while retaining existing smart contract functionality. **We will focus on the third option, and include the first two for good measure.**\n\n1. Distribution, burns and user-to-user transfers of Reddit Points are entirely carried out on the Syscoin network. This full-on approach to utilizing the Syscoin network provides the most scalability and transaction cost benefits of these scenarios. The tradeoff here is distribution and subscription handling likely migrating away from smart contracts into the application layer.\n2. The Reddit Community Points ecosystem can continue to use existing smart contracts as they are used today on the Ethereum mainchain. Users migrate a portion of their tokens to Syscoin, the scaling network, to gain much lower fees, scalability, and a proven base layer, without sacrificing sovereign ownership. They would use Syscoin for user-to-user transfers. Tips redeemable in ten seconds or less, a high-throughput relay network, and onchain settlement at a block target of 60 seconds. \n3. **Integration between Matic Network and Syscoin Platform - similar to Syscoin’s current integration with Ethereum - will provide Reddit Community Points with EVM scalability (including the Memberships ERC777 operator) on the Matic side, and performant simple value transfers, robust decentralized security, and sovereign store-of-value on the Syscoin side. It’s “the best of both worlds”. The trade-off is more complex interoperability.**\n\n# Syscoin + Matic Integration\n\n[Matic](https://matic.network) and [Blockchain Foundry Inc](https://blockchainfoundry.co), the public company formed by the founders of [Syscoin](https://syscoin.org), recently [entered a partnership](https://syscoin.org/news/blockchain-foundry-and-matic-network-establish-partnership-towards-full-scope-scalability-involving-syscoin-platform) for joint research and business development initiatives. This is ideal for all parties as Matic Network and Syscoin Platform provide complementary utility. Syscoin offers characteristics for sovereign ownership and security based on Bitcoin’s time-tested model, and shares a significant portion of Bitcoin’s own hashpower. Syscoin’s focus is on secure and scalable simple value transfers, trust-minimized interoperability, and opt-in regulatory compliance for tokenized assets rather than scalability for smart contract execution. On the other hand, Matic Network can provide scalable EVM for smart contract execution. Reddit Community Points can benefit from both.\n\nSyscoin + Matic integration is actively being explored by both teams, as it is helpful to Reddit, Ethereum, and the industry as a whole.\n\n# Proving Performance &amp; Cost Savings\n\nOur POC focuses on 100,000 on-chain settlements of token transfers on the Syscoin Core blockchain. Transfers and burns perform equally with Syscoin. For POCs related to smart contracts (subscriptions, etc), refer to the Matic Network proposal. \n\nOn-chain settlement of 100k transactions was accomplished within roughly twelve minutes, well-exceeding Reddit’s expectation of five days. This was performed using six full-nodes operating on compute-optimized AWS c4.2xlarge instances which were geographically distributed (Virginia, London, Sao Paulo Brazil, Oregon, Singapore, Germany).  A higher quantity of settlements could be reached within the same time-frame with more broadcasting nodes involved, or using hosts with more resources for faster execution of the process.\n\nAddresses used: 100,014\n\nThe demonstration was executed using [this tool](https://github.com/einalex/syscoin_transaction_generator). The results can be seen in the following blocks:\n\n612722: [https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/6d47796d043bb4c508d29123e6ae81b051f5e0aaef849f253c8f3a6942a022ce](https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/6d47796d043bb4c508d29123e6ae81b051f5e0aaef849f253c8f3a6942a022ce)\n\n612723: [https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/8e2077f743461b90f80b4bef502f564933a8e04de97972901f3d65cfadcf1faf](https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/8e2077f743461b90f80b4bef502f564933a8e04de97972901f3d65cfadcf1faf)\n\n612724: [https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/205436d25b1b499fce44c29567c5c807beaca915b83cc9f3c35b0d76dbb11f6e](https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/205436d25b1b499fce44c29567c5c807beaca915b83cc9f3c35b0d76dbb11f6e)\n\n612725: [https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/776d1b1a0f90f655a6bbdf559ff5072459cbdc5682d7615ff4b78c00babdc237](https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/776d1b1a0f90f655a6bbdf559ff5072459cbdc5682d7615ff4b78c00babdc237)\n\n612726:\n\n[https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/de4df0994253742a1ac8ac9eec8d2a8c8b0a6d72c53d6f3caa29bb6c171b0a6b](https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/de4df0994253742a1ac8ac9eec8d2a8c8b0a6d72c53d6f3caa29bb6c171b0a6b)\n\n612727: [https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/e5e167c52a9decb313fbaadf49a5e34cb490f8084f642a850385476d4ef10d70](https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/e5e167c52a9decb313fbaadf49a5e34cb490f8084f642a850385476d4ef10d70)\n\n612728:\n\n[https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/ab64d989edc71890e7b5b8491c20e9a27520dc45a5f7c776d3dae79057f59fe7](https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/ab64d989edc71890e7b5b8491c20e9a27520dc45a5f7c776d3dae79057f59fe7)\n\n612729: [https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/5e8b7ecd0e36f99d07e4ea6e135fc952bf7ec30164ab6f4d1e98b0f2d405df6d](https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/5e8b7ecd0e36f99d07e4ea6e135fc952bf7ec30164ab6f4d1e98b0f2d405df6d)\n\n612730: [https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/d395df3d31dde60bbb0bece6bd5b358297da878f0beb96be389e5f0e043580a3](https://sys1.bcfn.ca/block/d395df3d31dde60bbb0bece6bd5b358297da878f0beb96be389e5f0e043580a3)\n\nIt is important to note that this POC is not focused on Z-DAG. The performance of Z-DAG has been benchmarked within realistic network conditions: [Whiteblock’s audit](https://whiteblock.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ZDAG-Analysis.pdf) is publicly available. Network latency tests showed an average TPS around 15k with burst capacity up to 61k. Zero-latency control group exhibited \~150k TPS. Mainnet testing of the Z-DAG network is achievable and will require further coordination and additional resources.\n\nEven further optimizations are expected in the upcoming Syscoin Core release which will implement a UTXO model for our token layer bringing further efficiency as well as open the door to additional scaling technology currently under research by our team and academic partners. At present our token layer is account-based, similar to Ethereum. Opt-in compliance structures will also be introduced soon which will offer some positive performance characteristics as well. It makes the most sense to implement these optimizations before performing another benchmark for Z-DAG, especially on the mainnet considering the resources required to stress-test this network.\n\n## Cost Savings\n\nSee the [live fee comparison](https://syscoin.org/fees/) for savings estimation between transactions on Ethereum and Syscoin. Below is a snapshot at time of writing:\n\nETH price: $318.55    ETH gas price: 55.00 Gwei ($0.37)\n\nSyscoin price: $0.11\n\n![img](74a0j0oxh8e51 ""Snapshot of live fee comparison chart"")\n\nZ-DAG provides a more efficient fee-market.  **A typical Z-DAG transaction costs $0.0000064 USD based on current SYS value.** Tokens can be safely redeemed/re-spent within seconds or allowed to settle on-chain beforehand.  The costs should remain about this low for microtransactions.\n\nSyscoin will achieve further reduction of fees and even greater scalability with offchain payment channels for assets, with Z-DAG as a resilience fallback. New payment channel technology is one of the topics under research by the Syscoin development team with our academic partners at TU Delft. In line with the calculation in the Lightning Networks white paper, payment channels using assets with Syscoin Core will bring theoretical capacity for each person on Earth (7.8 billion) to have five on-chain transactions per year, per person, without requiring anyone to enter a fee market (aka “wait for a block”). This exceeds the minimum LN expectation of two transactions per person, per year; one to exist on-chain and one to settle aggregated value.\n\n# Tools, Infrastructure &amp; Documentation\n\n## Syscoin Bridge\n\n![video](b1bexjh9i8e51 ""Mainnet Demonstration of Syscoin Bridge with the Basic Attention Token ERC-20"")\n\nA two-way blockchain interoperability system that uses Simple Payment Verification to enable:\n\n* Any Standard ERC-20 token to be moved from Ethereum to the Syscoin blockchain as a Syscoin Platform Token (SPT), and back to Ethereum\n* Any SPT to be moved from Syscoin to the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token, and back to Syscoin\n\n### Benefits\n\n* Permissionless\n* No counterparties involved\n* No trading mechanisms involved\n* No third-party liquidity providers required\n* Cross-chain Fractional Supply - 2-way peg - Token supply maintained globally\n* ERC-20s gain vastly improved transactionality with the Syscoin Token Platform, along with the security of bitcoin-core-compliant PoW.\n* SPTs gain access to all the tooling, applications and capabilities of Ethereum for ERC-20, including smart contracts.\n\n### \n\n![img](l8t2m8ldh8e51)\n\n### \n\n![img](26htnxzfh8e51)\n\n### Source code\n\n[https://github.com/syscoin/?q=sysethereum](https://github.com/syscoin/?q=sysethereum)\n\nMain Subprojects\n\n* [Sysethereum contracts](https://github.com/syscoin/sysethereum-contracts): Ethereum contract deployment source code.\n* [Sysethereum agents](https://github.com/syscoin/sysethereum-agents): External agents.\n* [Sysethereum Dapp](https://github.com/syscoin/sysethereum-dapp): UI Dapp for reference implementation.

These will be based upon the same processes which are automated in the current live [Sysethereum Dapp](https://github.com/syscoin/sysethereum-dapp) that is functioning with the Syscoin mainnet.  \n\n### Documentation\n\n[Syscoin Bridge &amp; How it Works](https://syscoin.readme.io/docs/what-is-sysethereum-bridge-how-does-it-work) (description and process flow)\n\n[Superblock Validation Battles](https://syscoin.readme.io/docs/superblock-validation-battles)\n\n[HOWTO: Provision the Bridge for your ERC-20](https://syscoin.readme.io/docs/erc-20-to-spt-guide)\n\n[HOWTO: Setup an Agent](https://syscoin.readme.io/docs/sysethereum-agent)\n\n[Developer &amp; User Diligence](https://syscoin.readme.io/docs/user-safety-guide-how-to-recognize-a-secure-integration)\n\n### Trade-off\n\nThe Syscoin Ethereum Bridge is secured by Agent nodes participating in a decentralized and incentivized model that involves roles of Superblock challengers and submitters. This model is open to participation. The benefits here are trust-minimization, permissionless-ness, and potentially less legal/regulatory red-tape than interop mechanisms that involve liquidity providers and/or trading mechanisms.\n\nThe trade-off is that due to the decentralized nature there are cross-chain settlement times of one hour to cross from Ethereum to Syscoin, and three hours to cross from Syscoin to Ethereum. We are exploring ways to reduce this time while maintaining decentralization via zkp. Even so, an “instant bridge” experience could be provided by means of a third-party liquidity mechanism. That option exists but is not required for bridge functionality today. Typically bridges are used with batch value, not with high frequencies of smaller values, and generally it is advantageous to keep some value on both chains for maximum availability of utility.  Even so, the cross-chain settlement time is good to mention here.\n\n### Cost\n\n**Ethereum -&gt; Syscoin**:  Matic or Ethereum transaction fee for bridge contract interaction, negligible Syscoin transaction fee for minting tokens\n\n**Syscoin -&gt; Ethereum:** Negligible Syscoin transaction fee for burning tokens, 0.01% transaction fee paid to Bridge Agent in the form of the ERC-20, Matic or Ethereum transaction fee for contract interaction.\n\n## Z-DAG\n\nZero-Confirmation Directed Acyclic Graph is an instant settlement protocol that is used as a complementary system to proof-of-work (PoW) in the confirmation of Syscoin service transactions. In essence, a Z-DAG is simply a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where validating nodes verify the sequential ordering of transactions that are received in their memory pools. Z-DAG is used by the validating nodes across the network to ensure that there is absolute consensus on the ordering of transactions and no balances are overflowed (no double-spends).\n\n### Benefits\n\n* Unique fee-market that is more efficient for microtransaction redemption and settlement\n* Uses decentralized means to enable tokens with value transfer scalability that is comparable or exceeds that of credit card networks\n* Provides high throughput and secure fulfillment even if blocks are full\n* Probabilistic and interactive\n* 99.9999% security assurance within 10 seconds\n* Can serve payment channels as a resilience fallback that is faster and lower-cost than falling-back directly to a blockchain\n* Each Z-DAG transaction also settles onchain through Syscoin Core at 60-second block target using SHA-256 Proof of Work consensus\n\n### \n\n![img](pgbx84jih8e51)\n\n### Source code\n\n[https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin](https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin)\n\n### API\n\n[Syscoin-js](https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin-js) provides tooling for all Syscoin Core RPCs including interactivity with Z-DAG. \n\n### Documentation\n\n[Z-DAG White Paper](https://syscoin.org/zdag_syscoin_whitepaper.pdf)\n\nUseful read: [An in-depth Z-DAG discussion between Syscoin Core developer Jag Sidhu and Brave Software Research Engineer Gonçalo Pestana](https://hackmd.io/dStpqSfDQVC3T7W7jptjOQ)\n\n### Trade-off\n\nZ-DAG enables the ideal speed/security tradeoff to be determined per use-case in the application layer. It minimizes the sacrifice required to accept and redeem fast transfers/payments while providing more-than-ample security for microtransactions. This is supported on the premise that a Reddit user receiving points does need security yet generally doesn’t want nor need to wait for the same level of security as a nation-state settling an international trade debt. In any case, each Z-DAG transaction settles onchain at a block target of 60 seconds.\n\n# Syscoin Specs\n\n[Syscoin 3.0 White Paper](https://syscoin.org/syscoin3_whitepaper.pdf)\n\n(4.0 white paper is pending. For improved scalability and less blockchain bloat, some features of v3 no longer exist in current v4: Specifically Marketplace Offers, Aliases, Escrow, Certificates, Pruning, Encrypted Messaging)  \n\n* 16MB block bandwidth per minute assuming segwit witness carrying transactions, and transactions \~200 bytes on average\n* SHA256 merge mined with Bitcoin\n* UTXO asset layer, with base Syscoin layer sharing identical security policies as Bitcoin Core\n* Z-DAG on asset layer, bridge to Ethereum on asset layer\n* On-chain scaling with prospect of enabling enterprise grade reliable trustless payment processing with on/offchain hybrid solution\n* **Focus only on Simple Value Transfers**. MVP of blockchain consensus footprint is balances and ownership of them. Everything else can reduce data availability in exchange for scale (Ethereum 2.0 model). **We leave that to other designs, we focus on transfers.**\n* Future integrations of MAST/Taproot to get more complex value transfers without trading off trustlessness or decentralization.\n* Zero-knowledge Proofs are a cryptographic new frontier. We are dabbling here to generalize the concept of bridging and also verify the state of a chain efficiently. We also apply it in our Digital Identity projects at Blockchain Foundry (a publicly traded company which develops Syscoin softwares for clients). We are also looking to integrate privacy preserving payment channels for off-chain payments through zkSNARK hub &amp; spoke design which does not suffer from the HTLC attack vectors evident on LN. Much of the issues plaguing Lightning Network can be resolved using a zkSNARK design whilst also providing the ability to do a multi-asset payment channel system. Currently [we found a showstopper attack](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/72#issuecomment-613736569) (American Call Option) on LN if we were to use multiple-assets. This would not exist in a system such as [this](https://github.com/boltlabs-inc/libzkchannels).\n\n## Wallets\n\nWeb3 and mobile wallets are under active development by Blockchain Foundry Inc as WebAssembly applications and expected for release not long after mainnet deployment of Syscoin Core 4.2. Both of these will be multi-coin wallets that support Syscoin, SPTs, Ethereum, and ERC-20 tokens. The Web3 wallet will provide functionality similar to Metamask.\n\nSyscoin Platform and tokens are already integrated with Blockbook. Custom hardware wallet support currently exists via [ElectrumSys](https://github.com/syscoin/electrumsys/releases/tag/1.0.0). First-class HW wallet integration through apps such as Ledger Live will exist after 4.2.\n\n**Current supported wallets**\n\n[Syscoin Spark Desktop](https://github.com/blockchainfoundryinc/syscoin-spark-wallet/releases/tag/4.1.3)\n\n[Syscoin-Qt](https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin/releases)\n\n## Explorers\n\nMainnet: [https://sys1.bcfn.ca](https://sys1.bcfn.ca/) (Blockbook)\n\nTestnet: [https://explorer-testnet.blockchainfoundry.co](https://explorer-testnet.blockchainfoundry.co/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Thank you for close consideration of our proposal.

i1eooc,1596226513,Spacefold: Connext's submission to The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off,"https://medium.com/connext/introducing-spacefold-d1c227a29d3\n\nHello /r/ethereum!\n\nToday, we're excited to introduce our (rather unique) submission to the Reddit Scaling Bake-Off:\n\nhttps://spacefold.io\n\nSpacefold is a UI on top of Connext which enables cross-chain communication using state channels. It can be used to enable *instant* on/offboarding from turing complete L2 chains.\n\nSpacefold demonstrates this with:\n\n- Matic\n- xDai\n- Optimism\n- SKALE (coming soon)\n- Arbitrum (coming soon)\n\nWe have a [rough compatibility table here](https://github.com/connext/spacefold#compatibility-with-other-chains), but in general we should be able to support any evm-compatible chain.\n\n# What does this have to do with the Reddit Challenge?\n\nWe give a thorough explanation here: https://github.com/connext/spacefold#introduction-hold-up-how-does-this-meet-the-reddit-requirements-outlined-above\n\nIn short, Connext is a (micro)payment network that enables *point-to-point* communication about value - and we solve this one specific problem very very well.\n\nWe're not a blockchain-based system like other solutions out there (instead, we're structured much more similarly to TCP/IP) and so cannot provide global consensus on Community Point mint and burn actions.\n\nIn other words, using Connext for minting and burning Points would mean all user balances *have* to be private.\n\nWe decided to do something a bit different and work *with*, rather than against, existing L2 solutions to help mitigate some of their tradeoffs. With Connext, users can instantly (&lt;400ms) and trustlessly transfer, on/offramp using Wyre/Moonpay/etc, and even call contracts across chains in a way where *the user never needs to know what chain/rollup/shard they're on.\n\nBecause Reddit's requirements are so extensive, we think that they should consider using two or more solutions in conjunction to create a system that is simultaneously:\n\n- Performant\n- Cost-effective\n- Easy to on/offboard from\n- Interoperable with Ethereum\n- Extensible with low effort -- enabling easy and permissionless development new ecosystems/products/legos on top of Reddit is probably the most exciting part of the decentralized internet!\n- AND ALSO maximally trust-minimized, decentralized, and giving economic security at a level equal to or higher than Ethereum itself.\n\nSpacefold is an example of how seamlessly that solution could work.\n\n# Resources\n\n- The demo: https://spacefold.io\n- Open source code: https://github.com/connext/spacefold\n- Core connext implementation: https://github.com/connext/indra\n- Medium post/walkthrough: https://medium.com/connext/introducing-spacefold-d1c227a29d3\n\nWe've also tried our best to discuss the requirements laid out by the Reddit team as they apply to us.
