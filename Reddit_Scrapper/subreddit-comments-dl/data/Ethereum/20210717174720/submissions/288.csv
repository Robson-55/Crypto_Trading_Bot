I am being totally responsible with my money so I need to ask.\n\nI know Ethereum allows for creation of **decentralized applications**.\n\nI know this is important for people that **don't trust a third entity** or for people that **live in an oppressive country**.\n\nBut why would the **average joe** prefer decentralized services?\n\nWhy would **big finance players** want services decentralized? What benefits would why have?\n\nIn addition decentralized development is **harder** than development with a central server. So there needs so be benefits that would cancel that out. \n\nI'm worried about mass adoption. I want to know why the masses would flock to DeFi etc.\n\nIf you can convince me I will shift some money into ethereum. Currently I only have 5% in!

There is just two transactions not even a year ago, but I never used it in the last 3 or 4 years.\n\nJust wanted to mention this because either there is something very wrong with parity's derivation paths (or whatever, I'm no parity user nor crypto expert), or I am super lucky to find an already used wallet (with just 0.000x eth in it, nonetheless).",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ksfnu5/i_just_tried_to_recover_an_old_parity_wallet/,1,9
