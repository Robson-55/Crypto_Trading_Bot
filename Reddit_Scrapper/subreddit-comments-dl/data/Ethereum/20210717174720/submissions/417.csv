lqpxk5,1614106450,TLDR DD: Ethereum is not in danger. 1/100th price transactions are around the corner.,"Hi all. I’m new here but I wanted to cut through some noise. People are freaking out about fee basis for transactions on ethereum and how ETH 2 won’t solve this. You are not quite correct.\n\nHere are three developers actively working on products in the trenches being asked direct no BS questions about what will fix this and can we use Ethereum NETWORK for low cost transactions.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PuZ8kUueG10\n\nWatching this, you will probably not understand 90% of what they are talking about. Look at this video like getting to interview engineers at Apple as they are inventing the first iPhone and trying to follow along with what they are talking about in terms of their stack and how they will use various protocols to achieve their goals. Don’t expect to know every word but I loved it and it’s made me read a lot more into this.\n\nTLDR: ethereum will exist as a world network that has gas fees. On top of that robust security will sit l2 dapps that make use of new cost saving methods to bring your transaction costs to pennies. They will use roll ups to achieve much of this. These products EXIST. And they are currently live and FUNCTIONING. They simply haven’t reached the mainstream conciousness yet.\n\n1.) loopring allows for transactions at two orders of magnitude cheaper than current uses.\n\n2. Synthetix is looking at around 1/100th price vs current prices.\n\nNFT trading/buying in game and in dapp will leverage methods like this along the way to being on chain exhange costs to ZERO. \n\nThese are various ways in which as the network dapps and platforms evolve they will bring the ultimate cost per user down to pennies.\n\nIn the short term, users are looking for things like binance or other exchanges as ways to cheaply trade. Correct, that is a centralized exchange built on a copy of Ethereum a blockchain technology, copy paste. They built it and solved fee issues by keeping you on chain with their token. Ethereum is not a trading portal in this way just now. Ethereum is a network for moving financial liquidity and other NFT around from place to place. It’s also much more.\n\nAt some point, you will have to pay to on ramp, and pay to off ramp, from the network. That will use gas. But your gas fees will shrink drastically by using the new tools and platforms which are running in Ethereum network.\n\nBinance is a trading portal for penny stock cryptos.\n\nEthereum is a new world computer that securely and in a decentralized way allows you to transact financially across many platforms. You will interact with Ethereum network through many platforms. Ethereum is like the roads and highways of the world financial system, and they cost to use. The dapps sitting on top of the network are like little neighborhoods or cities or towns that you can use freely or next to free so long as you are still on the highway. \n\nIt seems, and I am a noob, so listen to the pros, but You are suffering high fees right now because we are trying to use the system as a get on and off with every transaction and that is not what the system is.\n\nYou are buying the future of the internet. You are buying the next financial system. It is literally being invented as we speak.\n\nThose who just want to trade crypto penny tokens should not use Ethereum right now. Within a year, you can use loopring via an exchange for such a thing but you are literally that early that it is being built.\n\nIt’s easy to copy the code remove then removed the decentralized component and make a trading exchange like binance. Might as well buy crypto on Robinhood. At least you get a wallet but it’s still not under your control if they want to manipulate the market. \n\nThis is how early you are. There is SO. MUCH. MONEY. To be made with ethereum that your eyeballs are going to pop out of your head as an INVESTOR. If you are a short term trader... you’re early and are going to pay fees. If you’re looking to use Ethereum like PayPal TODAY, you are early. But within a year as the new roll ups take effect, the services which leverage roll ups built on top of Ethereum will drive your costs down and increase adoption.\n\nYou are that early. Hodl.\n\nI’m sure some of this is not perfectly described but please do yourself a favor and watch the video. These are pros making the new world financial system and there is nothing close to the developer interest in this platform vs others. You may be right, the average day trader doesn’t care about decentralization, but the people building a world net financial and asset system DO. “If I asked people what they wanted... they would have said a faster horse.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lqpxk5/tldr_dd_ethereum_is_not_in_danger_1100th_price/,302,286
