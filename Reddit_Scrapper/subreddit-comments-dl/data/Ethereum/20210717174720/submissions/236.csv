k6e6qd,1607057700,Clarifying Staking Rules,"So I have read the Binance staking announcement and the language is a little confusing. This is what I understood please correct me if I am wrong. \n\n"" Let's say you stake 50 eth they will give you 50 BETH and then the rewards per day but if you use lets say 1 BETH in trading then the rewards you get will be as if you are staking only 49 ETH though if you dont trade your BETH and keep it then you will start compounding your interest. Also, when eth2.0 comes out u can trade whatever BETH u have to ETH2.0 at 1:1 ratio ""\n\nAlso anyone knows if other staking services like kraken will also compound interest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/k6e6qd/clarifying_staking_rules/,1,4

k6etkd,1607060285,Extremely noobish question about how to use keys to reclaim lost ethereum,"Hi guys,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust started mining eth and am finally at my first payout. Nanopool initially recommended the Mist wallet so I go to check it and nothing (other than a sync that never ends). I do some research, find out mist wallet is no longer a thing. What now?\n\nI have my keys written down and I also have a Trezor hardwallet.  So two questions:\n\n1. Is that ethereum that was supposed to go to my mist wallet gone forever? I'm pretty sure it is not, since I have my keys. In that case, how do I use those keys to reclaim the ethereum? Or am I just screwed?\n2. Is there a way to mine directly to my hardwallet? if not, what do you recommend I mine to instead of Mist?\n\nThank you so much guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/k6etkd/extremely_noobish_question_about_how_to_use_keys/,1,4
