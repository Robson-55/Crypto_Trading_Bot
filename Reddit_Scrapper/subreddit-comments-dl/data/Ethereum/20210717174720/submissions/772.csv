nyv2ot,1623586660,New Internet... ETH is fuel?,"Hello all, can someone please explain this concept to me, and why this would be mass adopted. I‚Äôve heard is said that Ethereum is the new Internet, and the eth is the fuel for it. Considering for our current Internet you can pay a small monthly fee for unlimited usage, I‚Äôm wondering why people would use a new Internet that has significant fees to use for almost everything that will be done on it.\n\nCan some one help me to understand how that will ever be adopted?

He has an ethereum wallet and he can't transfer them out of the wallet. As soon as he transfers ETH into his wallet, they are immediately send away.\n\nHow can he solve this?\n\nI try to write a python script that sends the tokens to another address as soon as ETH appear. Its my first time interacting with web3 and python and I fail at specifying the ABI correctly to check how many tokens are on the wallet.\n\nBut I have in mind that the thief might check each block whether he sends ETH to this wallet and immediately creates an order to send them to the thief's wallet.\n\nIs there any solution to this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nyvodo/problem_as_soon_as_i_transfer_eth_to_my_wallet/,1,22

nz0a9e,1623602315,Trying to get funds to Matic without any Ethereum in my wallet,"I know this is a noob mistake, but it's an especially expensive one on Ethereum. I purchased some Matic on Binance and trying to transfer it to Matic network. I should've listened to the guy who suggested going through BSC but selling and rebuying Matic again seemed like more work initially (although in hindsight would have been probably easier). So I paid \~$20 to Binance to move my Matic to ERC20, figuring it would be a one-time fee that I would quickly recoup with some yield farming on Matic. I knew the bridge would cost me another $10 or so but didn't realize I could only pay that fee in Ethereum, which I don't have.\n\nNow I'm in a position where I can't even buy Ethereum with my ERC20 Matic because swap fees are in Ethereum as well (I need \~$1.7 to approve Matic/Eth swap, and then I figure another couple bucks to trade it). Moving more money to Binance to buy some Ethereum to then send it to my wallet again would probably cost me another $50 in fees or so. What are my options to get the $5-10 in Eth I need without paying another $50 to get it to my wallet? I do have about $100 on Matic network if it's possible to transfer any of that to Ethereum for cheaper?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nz0a9e/trying_to_get_funds_to_matic_without_any_ethereum/,1,10
