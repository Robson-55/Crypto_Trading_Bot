lixdnc,1613208326,"Best opensource, non-hw wallet to hold ETH? (And maybe other alts)","Long story short, I can't get a hardware wallet, yet. But do want to hodl assets. From research, I've found it's best to store on opensource wallets, and not with exchanges. Although I've read coinbase is insured, and that has me rethinking it. But, still, I'd like an opensource wallet-only for ETH.\n\nAs a newbie, I recently used Blockstream green to create my first wallet, with the seed saved, but no funds in it, but it's BTC only. \n\nFurther reading about the Ethereum platform and ETH, I want to have ETH assets, too, and maybe LTC. \n\nBut I'm torn on what wallet to use. I just want to hodl, then start transacting in decades time(when I definitely will have a HW wallet).\n\nI don't plan on trading assets. Just buy(via P2Ps) into my wallet and hodl, till I get a HW wallet to transfer the assets to.\n\nIn summary; a good Blockstream green wallet alternative for ETH/altcoins.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lixdnc/best_opensource_nonhw_wallet_to_hold_eth_and/,1,24
