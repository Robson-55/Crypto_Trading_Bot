It is important that we as a community rally behind the right kind of layer to so that we stay as secure and decentralized as possible.\n\nhttps://medium.com/matter-labs/evaluating-ethereum-l2-scaling-solutions-a-comparison-framework-b6b2f410f955,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mhczgt/greate_writeup_on_the_tradeoffs_between_the/,1,4
mhd04m,1617216965,Ethereum: The Programmable Blockchain Changing the World,"I believe Ethereum and decentralized blockchains utilizing smart contracts will be the norm in the coming decades. The exchange of any information between two parties, whether it's financial assets, health data, or any other piece of information will simply be more efficient and secure to exchange via the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts versus the existing centralized, slow systems we have today. Because of this, I believe Ethereum's roughly $215 Billion dollar market cap is an absolute steal long-term, as just how the dollar is massive in market cap because all sorts of transactions and assets are priced in dollars, I believe the assets, transactions, and applications of the future will be a part of the Ethereum network. Because of this, I wouldn't be surprised by a market cap well north of $10 Trillion by 2050, an almost 50x from current levels. While I'm not promising a 10x in 1 year with Ethereum, I do believe the long-term financial upside of this digital asset is immense.\n\nI just uploaded a podcast talking about all of this and more, including how smart contracts work and current use cases for the Ethereum blockchain. If you want to learn more about Ethereum and why it's such an incredible technology, give my podcast a listen. You won't be disappointed.\n\n[https://anchor.fm/beyondmoney/episodes/Ethereum-The-Programmable-Blockchain-Technology-Changing-Everything-ettrre](https://anchor.fm/beyondmoney/episodes/Ethereum-The-Programmable-Blockchain-Technology-Changing-Everything-ettrre)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mhd04m/ethereum_the_programmable_blockchain_changing_the/,1,14

Since things move so quick, I'm recommending certain subreddits (ahem), newsletters and Twitter accounts. Then I thinks to myself, what about Twitter lists? I think this would be less intimidating for folks just coming into the space. (for the uninitiated, check out [this explainer of Twitter Lists](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out, u/DCinvestor has [a great collection.](https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/lists) I was curious if folks knew of any other good ones?

mhd9xh,1617217707,Binance: What happens when I buy BETH with ETH instead of staking ETH?,"First of all: I'm a very small and very inexperienced trader, trying to understand the whole crypto world.\n\nNow my question:\nI got my hands on a bit of ETH and staked them (on binance).\nI received BETH tokens in a 1:1 ratio, which will be converted back to ETH at the same ratio eventually. Including interest.\nSo far so good, I understand it.\nBut now I see a BETH/ETH trading pair, which in my mind implies that I can buy BETH with ETH. And one BETH at this time costs about 0.96 ETH.\nNow I wonder. Why would anyone (besides me, being inexperienced) stake ETH at a rate of 1 ETH = 1 BETH rather than just trading the 1 ETH for 1.04 BETH??\n\nWhat am I missing here? Could it be that the ""purchased"" BETH doesn't give any interest while staking ETH does?\n\nSorry if this is a dumb question. As I said at the start, I am an absolute beginner.
