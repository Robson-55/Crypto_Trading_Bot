lfp1bp,1612827133,GAS FEES GAS FEES GAS FEES.,"Ever since i got into ETH it‚Äôs gas fees gas fees gas fees. \n\nI know I‚Äôm not a blockchain developer and I have no experience working with code, but holy fuck this problem is so massive you think there would be more of an urgency to fix it. ( not to say that there is no urgency at all ) \n\nIs this not the same issue that‚Äôs been hindering Ethereums true potential to grow since it‚Äôs last ‚Äúbull run‚Äù to 1400?\n\nWhat is the current issue preventing some form of hot fix to help elevate gas fees.\n\nLong shot, but Is there anything us normal people can do to assist. \n\nI highly doubt ETH will get to 5k this year with the gas fees how they are right now. I‚Äôm surprised we are breaking previous ATHs... why would investors even want to invest when there‚Äôs an issue of this proportion. \n\nIf you feel I‚Äôm looking at this the wrong way or maybe your reading this like ‚Äúwow this dude knows ducking nothing‚Äù please enlighten me by sharing information so I can understand the extensive work that is probably needed to tame such an issue.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lfp1bp/gas_fees_gas_fees_gas_fees/,1,60
