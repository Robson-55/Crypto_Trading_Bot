nbiqt7,1620918332,If Elon Musk can move the prices of the entire Crypto Market then the purpose of cryptocurrency has failed," Dear Crypto holders. I started investing in cryptocurrency because I liked the idea of a decentralized currency where no bank or government can touch your wallet no matter what, and crypto prices not affected by any political announcements. The second one is no longer true. I thought that Elon had the power to move the price of a joke coin but it turns out he can move every single crypto coin with just 1 tweet. In contrast imagine an event like the Brexit a few years ago would affect the prices of Euro, Pound, Us, Canada and Australian Dollar and any other major currency at once. To any new crypto holders my self included: stop buying and selling crypto based on any big guy's tweets. Elon pumped Bitcoin and the second he changed his mind about it he dumped it. I am a fan of Dogecoin but do not be fooled, even if it gets accepted by Tesla like it is on SpaceX, once he gets bored of it he will dump it. No matter what crypto community you are part of or if you invest on all of them like me, all your efforts to support and hold your coin will be for nothing if we give anyone the permission to move its price up and down. Make sure to enter the crypto market once you fully understand the concept of a decentralized currency and only investing what you can afford to lose. Doing otherwise will result in you losing money and ruining gains/profits for the rest of us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nbiqt7/if_elon_musk_can_move_the_prices_of_the_entire/,1,46
