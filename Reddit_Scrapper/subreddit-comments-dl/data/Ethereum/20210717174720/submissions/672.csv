nd0262,1621088792,Details regarding how the RNG works for POS?,"Hello, could someone point to a guide/post/video regarding the details of how the RNG works for POS currently?\n\nI saw some old videos where about the process, where the participants commit a hash of a number and later disclose the number used to create the has. Later on, all the numbers are used as seeds for the RNG. However, in this case, the people observing the chain could choose to not disclose the numbers to maximize their chance of making more future blocks, also, as the numbers propagate through the distributed network, someone in the network could choose to censor the number information. Also, how is the deadline to disclose the numbers programmed?\n\nThere are some later articles talking about RANDAO + VDF, however, in this case, who are calculating the VDFs? If it's the same people who submit the VDF seeds, they could just choose to not submit the results of the VDFs to cheat. Also, machines calculate the VDFs in different speeds (20x or more), and someone looking at the seeds others submit for VDFs could use parallel computing to calculate multiple VDFs at once. How does this thing work really? And what's the deadline to submit VDF results?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nd0262/details_regarding_how_the_rng_works_for_pos/,1,0

It wouldn't be hard to fake all the block producing processes and timestamps and thus all the transaction history to make a 'real' chain like the original chain.\n\nFor this issue, there seems to be 'checkpoints'. However, for new network participants, a trusted third party could be required to provide them authentic checkpoint data. Are these third parties used in Ethereum? How are they selected?\n\nAlso, between checkpoints, it seems someone could make up a chain (with fake RANDAO processes) where all the cheating addresses are to produce blocks.

nd1ano,1621092257,Central Bank attack PoS vs. PoW,"Dear all,\n\nthere is a scenario in my head that made me post to discuss further. **It is highly appreciated if the bold questions can be discussed/answered.**\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* A central bank wants or a group of coordinated central banks want to attack a cryptocurrency network in order to establish rules, for instance banning specific adresses from participating in the network.\n* In order to achieve that, the central bank or group of central banks operate without communicating this to the public (for obvious reasons).\n* The attack doesn't aim to destroy the network. Reason why: For both PoS or PoW networks, the attacker(s) can just gain majority of stakes or computing power and destroy the network. Obviously, the crypto-community would react (forking, other networks, and so on...).\n* But the attacker has one specific aim: Enforcing rules in the system that the attacker endorses.\n\n**Now the big question is: Is PoW better suited to protect from this attack or PoS (by PoW I especially mean Bitcoin)? From my limited understanding it is PoW.**\n\nThe point I want to make clear is that under a PoW regime, the attacker would need a lot of funds to maintian at least 51% comuting power in the network, making this attempt a nightmare from the viewpoint of the attacker. That is a big advantage of heavy-energy usage to secure the PoW network (I am pointing out to Bitcoin especially). But on the other hand, in a PoS network, the attacker 'just' needs to gain a majority stake and change the rules. If that situation is reached, there is no need for additional effort that needs to be put into the network by the attacker. I see this as a great danger, as the ideal of a cryptocurrency is to free the world from the weapon of mass destruction called *central banking*. Of course, by doing network analysis, the community can detect a possible attacker on the PoS network (paired with data gained from exchanges, as this attack attempt would lead to price and probably volume distortions). And in order to ban some adresses, it must be known whom they belong to (let us assume this is a given).\n\n**How can a PoS network defend against that by design? Has this been considered by the Cardano protocol or any other PoS protocol so far?** In my opinion, this is a crucial issue if a crypto-network wants to become a world currency.\n\nMy ideas so far, please correct me if they are wrong:\n\n* Introducing an anonymous Blockchain, where it cannot be traced where funds are sent to. Of course this would make a network analysis on the Chain impossible, but the exchange data would still be available as this would give a lot of hints of such an attack attempt. And even if the majority stake is in the hands of the attacker(s): Who do they want to ban and how?\n* Introducing a *constitution* with rules as the impossibility of censoring/blocking adresses and so on with automatic mechanisms to kick out anyone who wants to ban someone else. **Is this even possible?
