n757xa,1620411737,Anyone else seriously regret not buying in earlier?,"When I was first considering Etherium, it was 1200CAD. I decided against it because I\`m on disability and need to use any extra money I have to help my mom who had a stroke... Now it\`s 4300CAD. I\`m so incredibly pissed off at myself, since &lt;3000 is about as much as I\`m able to save in a year. \n\nIf I bought one ETH a couple months ago, the profit would have been life changing. I put in what I can, but it feels so bad having 0.20 of one ETH when I could have had 1 if I\`d just acted when I meant to. I very strongly believe in this coin and I have another 5k that I\`m tempted to put in, but that would be all of my savings.\n\nAnyone else done something similar?

n7b84o,1620427743,About the growing popularity of mining using storage space...,"Chia is the first popular cryptocurrency that is mined using storage space, to me it looks like it's becoming an existential threat to all crypto:\n\n- It has caused hard drive and SSD prices to skyrocket, turning even more people [against cyrpto](https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/n5h171/are_hard_drives_in_short_supply/gx15srf/).\n\n- It has become another source of pollution on top of what we already have. It's not like miners will be like ""Hey, there's a green alternative now, let's all just stop mining!"" Even more ire incoming from environmentalists...\n\n- [Cloud providers have long-term supply contracts](https://old.reddit.com/r/chia/comments/n2lren/thoughts_on_a_hdd_shortage_from_an_industry/), but once they expire, or if it becomes profitable to just sell storage to miners, there will be less space available for web sites, leading to free content becoming paid, paid content becoming more expensive, more ads, more DRM, etc. Worst case, [it'll cause the end of Internet as we know it](https://old.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/n6skrt/chia_is_doing_to_hard_drives_and_ssds_what_other/gx918zj/), and crypto will essentially become universally hated. \n\nNaive journalists still think that [""it might also mean graphics processor prices come back down""](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/a-new-cryptocurrency-called-chia-could-push-up-hard-drive-prices-for-everyone/ar-BB1gqO2H), but it'll soon become obvious to everyone that this ain't going to be the case, and government bans are the way to end hardware shortages and pollution.\n\nSo... I think proponents for mining-free crypto should start proactively advocating for bans on wasteful crypto, before people get really mad and just ban cryptocurrency entirely... Just saying...\n\n**Disclaimer:** No interest in cryptocurrency, just want this insanity to end sooner rather than later...",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n7b84o/about_the_growing_popularity_of_mining_using/,1,17
