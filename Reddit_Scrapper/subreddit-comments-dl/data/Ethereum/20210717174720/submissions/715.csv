Obviously, it'll happen in steps.

nkkn13,1621930941,Ethereum == MySpace,"Ethereum has had a first-mover advantage when it comes to smart contracts and Defi. But there are already pretty clear signs that itâ€™s a jack of all trades and it isnâ€™t doing anything particularly well. So letâ€™s not kid ourselves here: itâ€™s on its way to becoming cryptoâ€™s MySpace.\n\n- Itâ€™s ultra unsound money. Constant changes to the base protocol, some of which proved to have near-fatal bugs, make it an untrustworthy SoV. PoS increases implementation risks and will anyways make the network more centralized and thus less neutral than Bitcoin. Sure, EIP1559 will have a nice effect on pumping the price of ETH but it will still be as much an SoV as AWS credits are.\n- Users donâ€™t care about decentralization. BSC already flippening Ethereum in terms of transactions, continuing increase in traction for other more centralized chains, and the proliferation of sidechains like Polygon show that users donâ€™t really care about decentralization on the application layer, but care more about usability/performance/low fees. Even if L2 finally makes a dent there are major caveats. Bitcoin will be the base money protocol whereas other, more centralized chains will be basically layers on top of Bitcoinâ€™s base layer through bridges. Even protocols on top of Bitcoin like RSK/Stacks will eat into Defi. Ethereum is stuck in the middle. \n- It doesnâ€™t have a clear vision. Retail normies have no idea what Ethereum really does and would rather go all in on dog coins. Itâ€™s a playground for web devs and early investors who can afford the stupendously high fees. Web2/Tradfi normies have lately been joining in on the altcoin casino fun.

nkp03v,1621947082,Market is heavily manipulated,"Looking at the charts of BTC, ETH, ETC, DOGE. They are exactly the same, down to 15 minutes candles. Who can time it perfectly like that? Even if alt coins all follow the same trend of BTC, they cannot go exactly the same down to minutes. If BTC 15 minute-candle goes up, all others follow, the same with down. There is only 1 explanation: market manipulation. All of them are buying/selling with bots marked to BTC chart. You can easily check that by opening binance charts. The only difference is the magnitudes. They don't go up or down with the same percentages. But they are exactly the same trend, even the magnitudes are somewhat similar. For example: if a BTC's candle goes up a lot, 10% in 15 minutes, others will have the same big up candle, maybe 8% or 12%. same as 1% or 0,5% small candles.   \nThis is why with heavy manipulation like this, it would be too hard to reach its real potential. First we have to figure out a way to chase out the bot traders. The best way is to ignore the hell out of it. If you buy it, just delete the app and come once every year to check if your coin is still alive. That's all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nkp03v/market_is_heavily_manipulated/,1,10

nkpuoh,1621949546,MEV after the switch to PoS,"I just watched the new Bankless episode on MEV  -&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVz7dOrGyY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVz7dOrGyY) (I highly recommend to subscribe to their channel. It really helps to actually understand the Ethereum ecosystem and stay up-to-date on all the new developments)\n\nIn the video the Bankless guys interview a panel of three MEV researchers about MEV and the implications of it for decentralized, trustless systems such as Ethereum. \n\nMEV or Maximum Extractable Value is basically all the extra value that a block proposer (either a miner under PoW or a validator under PoS) can extract from the system. Block proposers have this power because they can influence what transactions are included in the block and in what order they are included. For instance, they can ""sandwich"" (frontrun) trades, they can trigger liquidations and buy up discounted coins, and they can use many other strategies to extract (basically steal) extra value from the network and it's users. \n\nI think the main takeaway is that there does not seem to be a silver bullet to solving MEV, as it appears that MEV is inherent to trustless decentralized systems (you cant just make it illegal like in traditional finance). The best thing you can do is try to guide it in a way that is non-detrimental to the network and make it as transparent and accessible as possible, so everyone is aware of it and miners/validators equally share in the profits so as to avoid centralization due to information asymmetry. Basically this is the goal of these researchers with the Flashbots project. \n\nThey also briefly discussed the effects of PoS on MEV and how the current PoS model might actually worsen the MEV problem. \n\nCurrently under PoW block proposers are random based on the amount of hashpower they have. So a mining pool with a high percentage of the hashpower knows that it has an equally high chance of being the next block proposer. However it's still random, so they can never be sure. Therefore its very difficult to perform multi-block MEV strategies.\n\nUnder PoS block proposers are pre-selected and known at each 12 minute interval. This means that block proposers that are adjacent to each other can not only extract MEV from their own block, but can also collude to perform multi-block MEV strategies.\n\nThis has two very serious implications:\n\n1. Multi-block MEV strategies increase the value that can extracted (stolen) from the network and it's users.\n2. And even worse, it is VERY centralizing. Basically:  \nHigher percentage of validators under your control -&gt; Greater chance of controlling two or more blockproposers that are adjacent to each other -&gt; More MEV that can be extracted.  \nThis means that centralized staking pools will not only be able to give more consistent payouts (As a solo staker the chance of proposing a block is quite small), but also higher payouts as they generate more MEV. So people will be incentivized to quit solo staking and instead join a centralized service or pool.\n\nSingle block MEV seems bad enough, but multi-block MEV could perhaps really harm some protocols. How bad would this actually be? Maybe there are mechanisms that would prevent it? Also would this centralizing effect actually play out in reality or are other existing/planned mechanisms that would counter this? Are there other ways to counter this? \n\nIt just seems like a very important topic that deserves more attention from the community. Looking forward to your insights.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nkpuoh/mev_after_the_switch_to_pos/,1,3
