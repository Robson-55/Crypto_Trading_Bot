mlz62b,1617791558,Do I understand the basics Ethereum? And am I ready to buy in?,"Been diving into crypto this past week and I see a future in crypto I want to be part of. For some reason I started to look into ETH before BTC. Before I buy in for the first time, I want to make sure I understand what I'm buying. So I'll try to explain the basics in my own words, so please, if I say anything wrong, correct me ;).\n\nBTC is a digital currency running on blockchain. Making peer to peer transactions possible without a 3rd party. Ethereum is more like a platform. A platform running on blockchain, making various things possible. Running DApps, applications without a 3rd party. Smart contracts, a contract going into effect when a condition is met, without a 3rd party. NFTs, non fungible tokens which are unique because of certain codes/information (Ethereum has the creater code in the adress + runs a Royalty Tax). You could say BTC is an app, while Ethereum is a Play Store. \n\nAs of now, Ethereum ""lacks"" scalability (transactions per second), security and sustanability. Since running miners takes alot of energy. Ethereum 2.0 is trying to cover that.\n\n...are these the basics? Am I wrong somewhere? Do I need to know more before buying?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mlz62b/do_i_understand_the_basics_ethereum_and_am_i/,1,20

mlzbql,1617792256,Smart contract platforms should become rollups,"Riffing off this excellent post, an absolute must-read for anyone into crypto:  [Will we see a multi-chain world? - The Catalyst (substack.com)](https://dcinvestor.substack.com/p/will-we-see-a-multi-chain-world?r=18im0&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=twitter)\n\nA smart contract blockchain can be broken down into two main components: the virtual machine on which applications are built and the consensus mrchanism. For new platforms, consensus is very challenging, with highly centralized token distributions. Most smart contract platforms have opted for a delegated-type proof-of-stake solution where stakeholders vote for validators - essentially leading to plutocratic cabals over the long term. Needless to say, this has significant decentralization and security compromises. Of course, the delegated-type setups have evolved over the years. For example, Cardano, Cosmos and others improves on EOS/Steem by ""pre-bribing"" voters with ""staking rewards"" - although even in this case, further agreements can be made between validators and stakeholders over and above that. The likes of Polkadot and Tezos improve further by requiring validators to post a minimum number of tokens themselves, and adding slashing mechanisms. Yes, we do have non-dPoS-type chains like Zilliqa and Lukso but they have their own challenges. These consensus mechanisms can be very expensive, typically requiring protocol inflation in the 5%-15% range.\n\nWhat rollups allow is for smart contract platforms to build their own application layer, while simply contracting Ethereum to do the challenging consensus work. Ethereum brings massive economies of scale into play. The Merge is top priority post London, and soon we'll have Ethereum being secured by proof-of-stake. Unlike many of the delegated-type chains mentioned above, Ethereum uses ""real"" proof-of-stake, where validators are actually proving their own stake instead of others'. Combined with Ethereum's far more decentralized token distribution - thanks to running PoW for 6+ years, a higher market cap/larger economy, and executing significant economic activity on-chain ($20+ billion is settled on Ethereum everyday now!) - this means Ethereum's consensus mechanism can be several orders of magnitude more secure and decentralized than any newly minted chain. After The Merge happens, I expect around 500,000 validators securing Ethereum. (There are 115,000 already.) The overall inflation from proof-of-stake is capped at a maximum 2%, but very likely much lower, not even accounting for EIP-1559 fee burns. Yes, staking pool services and protocols will be built on top of Ethereum too, but they still have to run multiple validators for each 32 ETH stake, each validator still has an equal responsibility, and slashing mechanisms are a strong deterrence. I should note that as mentioned above, some chains do feature aspects of ""real"" proof-of-stake despite delegations - where at least portion of their validation is their own stake and slashing (like Polkadot, Tezos), or randomly selected validators (like Algorand), so there definitely are chains with some hybrid elements. Of course, there's always the possibility that some network comes up with an even better consensus mechanism - we can definitely have another discussion then. \n\nWhat rollups can do now is to simply focus on building a world-class application-layer, potentially surpassing what any L1 VM can offer. Currently, we see application-specific rollups like ImmutableX, Loopring, zkSync, dYdX etc. offering massive scalability for specific purposes today. Gas is so low that these platforms are effectively zero gas, fees abstracted away from the end user. ImmutableX does \~9,600 TPS for minting NFTs, and they only have to pay $0.003 in gas to Ethereum L1. That is only $30 for all NFTs in existence today! Sure as hell a lot cheaper than building and paying or your own consensus mechanism. By focusing on the most efficient application layer possible, and contracting out security to Ethereum, they are able to outscale any L1 today, while not materially sacrificing decentralization either. Oh, and transactions are confirmed instantly. Overall, they offer an experience simply not possible on any L1 platform. Of course, we also have generalized rollups incoming shortly, like Optimistic Ethereum or zkEVM, where anyone can deploy smart contracts arbitrarily.\n\nRollups can also have their own token and economic incentives, their own clients, sequencers and provers etc. I'm just not seeing enough teams leveraging the potential here. Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync 2.0 and StarkNet have a significant headstart, to be sure, but it's not too late to jump into what will likely be crypto's most intensely competitive field in the years to come.\n\nThere's plenty of room for innovation on the application layer with more efficient VMs, clients, programming languages, developer tooling etc. while at the same time letting Ethereum do the hard part of a highly decentralized and secure consensus mechanism. For example, zkSync 2.0's ZincVM is based on LLVM, which offers a fantastic alternative to L1 EVM for developers, and enables supporting programming languages like Rust. It's a win-win-win for all: platforms, developers and users. **At this point, building an alternate L1 is more hubris than reason.**\n\nWell, with one exception - when marketing can overpower the security weaknesses, and decentralization is no longer important. Currently, I see only two platforms that have achieved this - Binance Smart Chain and Flow. Both are leveraging very popular centralized platforms - Binance CEX and NBA Top Shots - to build a strong user base and network effects. Or, by building a strong niche - some smart contract platforms may have features not possible with rollups. One such example will be a highly centralized but highly performant chain like Solana which can potentially offer greater throughput than even Ethereum rollups - at least till data sharding releases in the next year or two - but at this level of centralization it's a complete different type of product anyway. \n\nOne last thing - addressing composability and interoperability. Nothing changes here, solutions for L1 &lt;&gt; L1 situation today can be extended to L2 &lt;&gt; L2 and L1 &lt;&gt; L2 communication. Indeed, it could be better than fragmented L1s, for example multiple L2 AMMs can use a common liquidity pool on L1. We have several projects with these type of solutions like Celer, Connext and Hop.\n\nWith all that said - which L1 do you think will be the first to pivot to being an ethereum rollup?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mlzbql/smart_contract_platforms_should_become_rollups/,1,41

mlzynw,1617794891,Lowest Gwei price,"Hi everyone, I am very new to Blockchain and Ethereum and I have a couple of questions and would appreciate it a lot if you guys explain it in a very easy language (plain english, no to very little technical things). One thing I am interested in is lowering a transaction costs (Gwei prices if I understood everything correctly). In my Trust Wallet I can choose the amount of Gwei price and Gas limit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) What is Gwei price and what is Gas limit? I just know that for a simple transaction like transferring money, the minimum Gas limit is 21,000. Also as you can see in the picture there are different options like ounce and etc. What to they mean and can I adjust them to get the lowest fee possible? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I have entered the Gwei price as 40 and my transaction got rejected. So what is the minimum Gwei price that I can enter, how do I know it (because if I understood correctly it is constantly changing and there is no fixed price). And also one more very important point for me, I do not neet the transaction to be completed immediately, I can wait for as long as you want, I just want to know how I can get the transaction completed by spending the minimum amount. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would highly appreciate any response. Thanks a lot take care.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9ordw68lqr61.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c97081b35e46ebb8a3e86e83d32f44140ab318d2",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mlzynw/lowest_gwei_price/,1,6
