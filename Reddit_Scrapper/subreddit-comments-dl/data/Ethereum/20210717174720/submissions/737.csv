nppl07,1622538031,How etherum saved my life.,"So Iâ€™ve been having struggles with money for all my life . Been strictly with one bank and used it ever since I was born. I recently started to branch out saving because they didnâ€™t have any interest rates on my savings account . \n\nAlong the way I got way into crypto. I have strong feelings about Eth, positive ones. And so I put a majority of my money in ETH. Which seemed risky at first. But I thought hey, itâ€™s pretty good to have some money off the grid so to say. \n\nWell today it payed off. The bank has had problems with purchases from a month ago and it put me in the mud. Iâ€™m currently -200$ in my fiat bank and couldnâ€™t even start thinking about paying it back. But..\n\nI still have my etherum. That they couldnâ€™t touch because of errors on their side. And that etherum is the one thing thatâ€™s paying for everything right now. Food, housing , the whole deal. \nI donâ€™t know why more people donâ€™t believe in crypto, but when I get my salary at the end of this month I think itâ€™s time to invest more into this. It just seems logical. (After clearing my debt ofc) \n\nJust thought Iâ€™d share my positive experience with ETH. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nppl07/how_etherum_saved_my_life/,1,84
