lot0m2,1613897536,How to access Ethereum wallet with JSON keystore file?,"So it has been a while since I looked at Ethereum. I once transferred my Ether from an exchange onto the blockchain itself, for safekeeping. I didn't want to become a victim of one of those exchange hacks.\n\nBut how do I now access that Ether on that address? I have all kinds of backups. I used the `geth` tool back in the day to do the transfer. The keystore file should give me access to the Ether again, right? At least, that's what I needed to the transfer in the first place. So it seems to be a solid guess I only need that now again.\n\nBack in the day I had to download the ledger with `geth` to do the transfer, which was then just a few GB. I guess times have changed and it's too big to 'quickly' download it. Is downloading that ledger still needed? The documentation is not really [straightforward](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options). And I believe there was a GUI when I used it...\n\nAny help? So in a nutshell:\n- I have a JSONv3 keystore file.\n- How do I access my ether with that?\n- Can I use `geth` for that? If so, do I need to download the whole ledger?\n- What are the alternatives?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lot0m2/how_to_access_ethereum_wallet_with_json_keystore/,1,4
