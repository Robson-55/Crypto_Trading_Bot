lj9so9,1613251888,13+ HOURS &amp; Counting For a Simple Wallet to Wallet Transfer... This is INSANE!!!,I just took an ass raping last night trying to get my cash from my bank into my wallet the fastest way possible to take advantage of some plays that were shaping up. \n\nI paid the exorbitant Debit Card Transfer Fee because I'd make it back no problem. \n\n13 Hours Later..... Still haven't received the cash... Missed all the quick gains in ZIL and some of the others... \n\nA couple weeks ago it took all of 5 minutes to send money from wallet to exchange...\n\nAnyone else experiencing this snails pace issue?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lj9so9/13_hours_counting_for_a_simple_wallet_to_wallet/,1,13

Because VRAM Temperature seems to be fine. I would also be really happy, if you could give me a feedback for my settings. Are these good results? Is the power usage-hashrate ratio fine?
