nj9eas,1621781813,Some ETH and USDT Advice,"Hi guys, so I need some ETH and USDT advice... I‚Äôve currently got some USDT stuck (approx $600) over on Trust Wallet and with no ETH for gas fees to convert it to any other coin at the moment, however if I buy some ETH to cover the gas fees what are the fees most likely to be and what percentage will it be to the value of the USDT? I don‚Äôt want to buy some ETH and then get stuck because I haven‚Äôt bought enough, and I don‚Äôt want to pay the equivalent to the value of the $600 USDT just to unlock it, which makes no sense right? \n\nI originally bought the USDT on Uphold and sent it to my Trust Wallet and now want it to go back to Uphold where gas fees are almost non existent.. So how do I do this? I have been advised that converting the USDT to something like TRX is by far cheaper option, or converting to DASH and then transferring back to my Uphold where I can convert it back to USDT to save my gas fees, but I don‚Äôt know how much ETH gas fees I will need to unlock the USDT? Hope you can shed some light on this.. Thanks  üôåüèΩüôèüèΩ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nj9eas/some_eth_and_usdt_advice/,1,7

njauwj,1621786144,"Owning ETH is a wild ride, but I don't care if it drops another 90%","These last few months have been incredibly enlightening. I'm late to the crypto party, I've resisted for so long. I work in cybersecurity and the ransomware angle has left a really bad taste in my mouth. But it all finally clicked for me and I've been reading and researching voraciously for weeks. I've been playing the market these last two months, and I'm slightly down on my overall investment. But I am holding on a ten year time horizon and will be buying more ETH (and a few other select cryptos) like clockwork every two weeks with my paycheck. If the price crashes further it doesn't bother me. My average cost will drop with it as I continue investing.\n\nBut most importantly, I've discovered this amazing Ethereum ecosystem. I've developed my first two hello world Dapps, and I'm excited to start building a more serious project of my own, or contribute to an existing project.  Crypto has a lot to figure out, but it will get there, and it has one more person that is going to help it along the way. The promise is too great to ignore.\n\nI am very bullish on ETH and crypto generally. And by ""bullish"" I'm not talking only about its price. It's so much bigger than an asset to buy and trade. My only regret is that I waited so long to look into crypto.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/njauwj/owning_eth_is_a_wild_ride_but_i_dont_care_if_it/,1,14

nje72f,1621795559,Staking: what will happen to my stake if Ethereum 2.0 were to never happen?,"I was reading the Kraken staking guide and came across this [image](https://support.kraken.com/hc/article_attachments/360094768932/Staking_ETHWarning_05062021.png) of theirs. At the bottom you'll see there's an ""Important"" warning section that states, among other things ETH and staking rewards will be locked until the Ethereum 2.0 transition is complete... this may take years **or may never occur**.\n\nSo does this mean if I were to stake now, there's a major risk in that if the 2.0 upgrade is indefinitely postponed, I would just never have access to my funds, potentially forever? That is how I'm interpreting this statement. Can someone confirm?\n\nPersonally I am a big believer in Ethereum and interested in holding it over a the next couple years at least, without any intention to sell or trade, so I am okay with volatility and price fluctuations in the meantime. I think it would be wonderful to receive some staking dividends on my investment in this period but if that potentially means I could never have access to my investment again, I feel like it's something I should reconsider.
