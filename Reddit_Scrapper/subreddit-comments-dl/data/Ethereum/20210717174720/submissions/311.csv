kzbq56,1610907772,Lowering the barriers of participating in PoS,"One of the initial barriers to staking is the hefty 32 ETH minimum to run a node. This is pretty easily overcome by users pooling their money together so a node can be run.\n\nThe bigger problem is trying to avoid slashing. Who will actually run and control the node(s) for the pool? Whats the incentive for the ones running the hardware? How do you guarantee the one running the PoS node doesn't lose your staked ETH?\n\nRocketpool lets individuals operate chunked nodes under a root PoS node for 16 ETH. Yes easier to participate than 32 ETH, but still a considerable jump compared to someone with 0.001 ETH running mining software on their gaming rig when they aren't using it.\n\nMy question is, why stop at 16 ETH chunks of a single PoS node? Why can't a user with 0.001 ETH offer some computer power in order to ensure the root PoS node stays stable?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kzbq56/lowering_the_barriers_of_participating_in_pos/,1,6
