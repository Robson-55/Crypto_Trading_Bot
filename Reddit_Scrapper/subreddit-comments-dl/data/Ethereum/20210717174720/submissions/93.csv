i1s8a9,1596288619,Will there be enough validators?,Is it just me or is the threshold for activating the beacon chain extremely high?  First you need to deposit 32 eth which is over 10 grand USD.  Second you can’t withdraw for at least a year until at least phase 1.  Third the rewards are capped at 20%.  Fourth you need to keep your pc and internet running continuously over this lock in period or risk getting slashed.\n\nHow can we expect over 16k people to sign up for this come November?  Don’t get me wrong-I am really looking forward to eth2 but it worries me if enough people will become validators because of these high requirements.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/i1s8a9/will_there_be_enough_validators/,1,9
