l73jp0,1611855788,Denex | The Decentralized NFT Exchange,"Hi Everyone, \n\nToday we are announcing the start of our project: Denex, an open-source and decentralized NFT exchange with hyper-customizable NFT listing options. \n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique and semi unique items on the blockchain. Fungibility refers to the ability for an item to be exchanged interchangeably and indistinguishably with another of the exact same item. For example, if I give you a dollar bill and you give me another dollar bill, we each still each have a dollar. Dollars are fungible. Now instead imagine I gave you a house and you gave me back another house. Down to the smallest details there will be a difference between any two houses in the world, and it is not an item that is interchangeable with another of the same item.\n\nNFTs currently have the highest potential out of any technology in blockchain. There is work being done to tokenize real estate, and you can buy insurance contracts stored as NFTs. Additionally, the cryptoart world is thriving, passing $8 million USD in sales December alone, and even Christie‚Äôs auction house sold NFT art in September. Looking at the future potential of the NFT space, it encompasses the entire real estate, automotive, art, collectable, insurance, and gaming industries, and effectively any other unique item you can think of.\n\nAfter many conversations with NFT creators and collectors, we have set out to fix some systemic issues with the NFT space. Namely, the trend of centralizing technology to create switching barriers within platforms. \n\nFrom a technical perspective, the value of NFTs stems from three things: provable rarity through the blockchain, secure and immutable ownership of tokens, and censorship free participation in the ecosystem. At the moment, only one of those things is true for NFTs. NFTs are provably rare by and through the blockchain, but even that is being threatened by ‚Äúgasless minting‚Äù which essentially lets you sell something as an NFT before it has actually been created. In the case of secure and immutable ownership, the metadata which make up the contents of the NFTs are almost exclusively stored on private servers, making them easily alterable, and if the company storing them goes away, so does the contents of the NFT. Finally, censorship free participation in NFTs is constantly under threat from the centralization of NFT metadata, and the limitation of open and customizable transaction options. Even on a decentralized network, dictating the way people exchange items opens the door to censorship of the exchange of those items, and if the decision making those restrictions is centralized, it becomes centralized and censorable from the top down.\n\nWe have set out to fix these problems, and ensure that the NFT ecosystem reaches its full potential. To do this, we are building some key functionality into our NFT marketplace, focused on open access to contracts and customizable listings. These features include:\n\nGlobal ERC-20 compatibility\nMuti-Token Listings\nNon-Locked NFT Listings\nBuy Now and English Auction\nVariable Timeframes\nDecentralized Governance\n\nWe will also be launching our token, DNX, in a pre-sale in the near future. The DNX token will have some key functionality within our marketplace and ecosystem as a whole. That functionality includes:\n\nLiquidity Mining\nGovernance\nDiscounted Transaction Fees\nStaking for Various Platform Functionalities\nTrade Mining\n\nTo learn more about our project, please see additional details here: https://denexnft.gitbook.io/denex/.\n\nTo become a part of our community, please join our:\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/ZDySTCZfHF\nTelegram: https://t.me/joinchat/GNtZD3XJwAgC-2vS\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DenexNFT\n\nThank you, and we are looking forward to hearing comments on the project!\n\nBest,\nThe Denex Team",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l73jp0/denex_the_decentralized_nft_exchange/,1,10

l74s4w,1611859226,WeeWallet Ethereum scam?,"So I've just discovered that my mum bought into this sketchy looking wallet which supposedly lets you buy Ethereum. It's called WeeWallet and it's kinda scaring me because we've invested about $500 for 100,000 'tokens' which can apparently be traded for ETH.\n\n She was told by a friend that has invested quite a bit and she's been convinced that this app lets you invest into ETH and that your money will be returned? I'm kinda confused because when I look it up there's no results but when I look up WeeCoin it comes up as a scam. \n\nIt's kinda scaring me because it sounds just like a Pyramid Scheme as she's been told to refer her friends and then to refer their friends... So could you guys advice me on what to do because the company is apparently saying that the tokens are not worth anything right now because of Covid \n\nThanks üëçüèæ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l74s4w/weewallet_ethereum_scam/,2,17

l77c5o,1611864688,Atomic swaps with centralized services,"Let's say you have a centralized service S, like a bank, which has the following functionalities:\n\n1 - You can create a charge with a given id, value and receiving address.\n\n2 - You can pay a given charge and receive a signed proof by S that you did it.\n\nThen it would be possible to create a escrow smart contract to atomically swap between Ethereum and this service, as following:\n\n1 - You send your Ether to the contract and simultaneously create a charge in S with a given price. The ether is now locked in the contract as a sell order.\n\n2 - Some other unknown party locks the order, pays your charge using S and publishes the signed transaction id, along with a receiving Ethereum address.\n\n3 - The contract verifies the signature and, if valid, releases the locked ether to the received address informed in (2).\n\nIs there any previous work done in this direction or obvious flaws in this setup? I ask because I think this would be an incredible bridge from traditional financial services to Ethereum, and would allow for a decentralized, peer-to-peer market to be established, without KYC constraints. Not only that, if the market was liquid enough this would also allow for unidirectional payments from Ethereum to S and vice-versa by routing the transaction through the market.\n\nIn fact, Brazil's central bank has just released a system that works a lot like the one described above, and, if feasible, I would be interested in implementing such market, so I'm interested about previous similar efforts.\n\nThanks for any replies!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l77c5o/atomic_swaps_with_centralized_services/,1,2
