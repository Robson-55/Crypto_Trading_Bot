n6c5rk,1620320829,IS ETH GOING POS BY YEARS END EFFECTING CURRENT MARKETS?,"Word is Proof of stake is coming to Eth sooner than later. By years end I believe is the plan. After Eip1559 the miners are going to be out of work come years end.\n\nAs a miner who invested $10ks in Gpu rigs they have to feel like they don't have a voice at all in what is going on in Eth.\n\nObviously POS blockchains are thriving as Cardano and Algo and Tezos have proven successful and secure.\n\nAs for Eth it could have stayed as the Silver to BTC gold as a store of value. With miners needing new work by years end, ETC which is the original eth blockchain could be the answer.\n\nEtc is blasting off as we speak and miners who have $10000s of gpu tech need something to mine and it seems like ETC can become the new Silver store of value to BTC gold.\n\nEtc has a coin cap limit. And with the hash rate improving and more miners coming over due to eth.going to proof of stake there is no reason to think that ETC won't rocket off to the moon with all this retail investment into crypto alt coins. \n\nBefore you say ETC is a dead project and a ghost chain, simply look at dogecoin.. Those profits need to go into other projects and ETC at $100 looks far more profitable than $3500 for 1x Eth.\n\nWith Doge being a middle finger to the establishment and eth getting so much institutional investors from Wall Street who knows what will happen.\n\nI think Eth2 will be a huge success if everything comes together and there is no security issues with 51% attacks. But the miners are going to be furious even more so with Eip1559 so maybe it's in Eths best interest to help boost ETC. \n\nEven as a thank you to the miners who helped built the network.. Maybe Eth should invest in ETC as Silver to BTC gold that way miners can transition to ETC.\n\nI know there is alot of bad blood but plenty of blockchain to go around and no reason ETC can't become the Silver store of value to BTC gold.\n\nAlso Eth devs will come off as caring with regards to helping the miners continue to have income after eth closes their mines and put them all out of work.\n\nThis way Eth is finding good work for its Ex Miners. It's least they could do after the Miners helped make Eth devs become billionaires. \n\nPlenty of blockchain to go around for everyone guys.\n\nThe future will be about Interoperability and scalability.\n\nMy 2 cents anyways.

I did this through Coinbase and applied for staking.. Just got approved for staking now, today...don't know how. Seem like others been waiting for months...\n\nCan people please help me out here? Should I stake or let this ride and paper hand it and take profits? I really don't know what to do.\n\nI've got 50k in saving, 41k now really as I just randomly dropped the 9k on ETH. It's my only investment other than a conservative 10k in a Roth IRA with ETFs.\n\nWhat are the pros/cons to staking? What's the time frame? Is crypto really the way to go? I know it's volatile by nature and 9k is a lot to me..I'm looking to make as much as I can as quick as I can, then reinvest DCA over time and actually learn more about crypto and the ETH network, business and all that. \n\nPlease, share your recommendations, questions, obersvations.\n\nBash me for being an idiot with this stuff if you need but make it constructive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n6cj7r/to_stake_or_not_to_stake/,1,10

n6coh4,1620322239,Did I just pay $12 for a failed transaction?,"Maybe I'm just a dumb noob that lost an insignificant amount. That's fine, I'll survive. Not giving the amount a second thought. No, my problem here is with the system.\n\nMy problem is why I was not made aware that a failed transaction USES the gas and it can never be returned. My problem is that it takes A LOT of expensive gas to perform a transaction and it's up to pure chance (unless you pay A LOT) wether it succeeds or not. This is something everyone else just knows? Was I supposed to understand this somehow? I certainly do now.\n\nAnd now that I learnt my lesson, my eth is stuck in metamask. I can't move those funds anywhere without reducing them to half their value. Ethereum, for me, even at a small amount, has lost me more than on any of my other investments. And that was BEFORE I got to use it for anything during a perfectly normal series of transactions.\n\nYou people enjoy your gas fees, I'm going back to other networks and crypto that have reasonable fees that don't rob you on smaller amounts. Try transferring XRP some time, you'll be surprised when you pay less than $0.5 for a transaction that WORKS.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n6coh4/did_i_just_pay_12_for_a_failed_transaction/,1,10
