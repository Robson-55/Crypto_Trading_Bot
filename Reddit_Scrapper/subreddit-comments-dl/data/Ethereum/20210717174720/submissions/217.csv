jywjhj,1606055552,Looking for help!,"Looking for help! My devil spawn last night purchased a token on UNI (a scam coin) which we are unable to swap back on UNI. It seems however that a handful of wallets have the ability to sell- possibly interacting directly with the contract? If anyone has the knowledge and would be so kind to walk us through getting this token swapped back, we'll throw you a $100 in eth! \n\nWallet to wallet error we get when attempt to send:\n\n Warning!

Planning a bigger overhaul to the guide for that.\n\n[Link to the guide](https://someresat.medium.com/3da74372910?source=friends_link&amp;sk=835747c0fab93ccf85b4866ffae74b25)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jz28c5/updated_guide_for_ubuntupyrmontteku/,1,0

If I understand everything I have read correctly so far, ETH 1.0 PoW will continue to run parallel until Phase 2. \n\nSo miners will continue to receive the same ETH 1.0 rewards until PoW is deactivated in Phase 2. While at the same time Stakers are receiving ETH 2.0 rewards between phases 0 &amp; 2. Doesn't this mean when Phase 2.0 hits there is going to be a massive flood of extra ETH in the ecosystem and potentially a price drop?

( 0**.**00002031 ETH left)\n\nWhat is my best course of action here?\n\nCould I mine enough for this one transaction in a day? I do have an RTX 3080 I can put to work.\n\nShould I just buy ETH on an exchange and send it over?
