I work as a software developer so the concept of private keys isn't new to me but even with a technical background it took a lot of reading and research to figure out how everything works. Also copped the gas fees to make a small deposit from the exchange to the wallet and then reset the wallet with my seed phrase to make sure I didn't mess anything up before transferring the rest.\n\nEven reading through a few threads in this sub and I see other people also get confused about how seed phrases and wallets work and I don't blame them. I also have a few friends who just got into crypto and don't want to take their coins out of centralised exchanges because they think it's still a lot safer and easier to deal with there.\n\nIMO the user experience of wallets and safely storing coins can still be improved, but keen to hear what everyone else thinks too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mxjoxt/does_anyone_else_think_wallets_are_still_very/,1,75
