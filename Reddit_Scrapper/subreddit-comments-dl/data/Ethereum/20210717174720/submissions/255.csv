kfnhyt,1608306333,Cardano Launches KEVM Devnet - Come Try it Out!,"The Solidity language is now supported on Cardano's KEVM Devnet, a preproduction environment in which Solidity developers can use their existing skills to create smart contracts on Cardano. This is the result of a partnership with Runtime Verification, lead by Gregory Rosu, in which they developed the K  Framework, which allows various coding languages to be compiled based on their pre-defined semantics and executed on the same system. This also introduces formal verification to Solidity programs run in the KEVM Devnet.\n\nRead the KEVM documentation here:\n\n[https://developers.cardano.org/en/virtual-machines/kevm/overview/](https://developers.cardano.org/en/virtual-machines/kevm/overview/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kfnhyt/cardano_launches_kevm_devnet_come_try_it_out/,0,4

kfo6mb,1608308511,"I made a fantasy trading card game, with AI generated character arts","[https://etheroes.io](https://etheroes.io)\n\nA bit of history: The idea of the cards started when I saw how an AI could generate realistic photos of people. I tried to apply the same techniques to generating fantasy characters, and got amazing results.\n\nThe next 2 weeks were spent on designing the card assets, hero traits and descriptions. I borrowed some ideas from D&amp;D (attribute points and alignment). Also threw in a random name generator, of which the names were scraped all over the internet.\n\nOnce I had the card assets, the rest all fell in place. It was obvious that Ethereum was the best market place for such a collectible game. I spent the next 2 weeks writing the smart contract (based on ERC 721) and various pieces to support trading on the site. Fun fact: ETH price took off right before I was ready to deploy the contract on the mainnet. Due to high gas price, I had to spent a fortune... not fun!\n\nBTW, why didn't I use ERC 1155? I had planned for more types of assets in the game, so it seems ERC 1155 would be a better choice. The problem is it's very awkward to use the ERC 1155 interface if your main focus is pure NFTs. Maybe I'm still missing something. Oh well, I'll figure it out later.\n\nFor a limited time, the cards will be free to claim. But good luck with the transaction fees lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kfo6mb/i_made_a_fantasy_trading_card_game_with_ai/,15,15

kg4sms,1608369922,How to fund Formality? Ideas and thoughts related to Ethereum,"I've been researching my options to fund the [Formality](https://github.com/moonad/formality) project. For those that don't know, Formality is a programming language that was initially developed at the Ethereum Foundation, with the goal of making smart-contracts safer using formal proofs. When the foundation announced the separation of some internal teams, I was possibly the first to ask to leave, because I judged the project was shifting away from being Ethereum-centered, and I wanted freedom to explore other areas without being a cost for the Ethereum Foundation. Since then, we've been funding its development with our own resources. We could keep doing so indefinitely, but there are many cool projects that we'd like to take that would require hiring more people, and we don't have the resources for that.\n\nWhile I could look for investors in a traditional setting, I don't feel like Formality is really a project that fits the usual startup lifecycle. Trying to find ways to profit will shift our priorities, and we'll end up developing things that are profitable for us, but not necessarily as cool for the community. For example, developing a mature, market-ready, massively parallel compiler for functional programming languages based on interaction nets is something I've been dying to do for years, is costly, but would never be in the scope of a conventional startup.\n\nI have, though, this little idea on my mind. The plan is: I'll create a quadratic token for Formality. That is, in order to buy the `nth` token, you must pay `n * k` Ether. That token will not be a merely ""funding"" token, like Gitcoin, but more like a stock, in the sense token holders will have access to several benefits such as being able to demand features, to consult the team, and having part of the profit of any eventual for-profit app we develop in a future.\n\nThe reason I think such token would work great is that it would allow us to have the flexibility to shift between for-profit and non-profit developments, raising on demand, without having the immediate pressure that an ICO would bring. In other words, I believe the price of the token would be more honest, reflecting, in ""real time"", the overall interest and projected profitability of our project. It would be as if we had a stock, except at much smaller scales. If we don't do anything remarkable or profitable, there will be no increased interest, the token would just have a constant (possibly 0) value, and nobody would ""feel scammed"". Great! If we announce some cool app that turns out to be profitable, or if the community just decides to invest in us, the token would immediately rise in value as people seek to have a share of these profits, and we'd have the resources to execute such project. IMO it seems to be the most ""mathematically correct"" to fund our team.\n\nWhat do you think? Does that make sense? Am I missing something?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kg4sms/how_to_fund_formality_ideas_and_thoughts_related/,2,7
