In Appendix D of the [Yellowpaper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf), there is a definition of how the modified Merkle Patricia Tree is supposed to be structured. \n\nBut right in the first sentence, Wood writes: \n\n""The modified Merkle Patricia tree (trie)..."" and subsequently uses ""trie"" instead of ""tree"". \n\nDoes anybody have an explanation for this? \n\nI want to cite the yellowpaper for my undergrad thesis and since I always write about the ""trie"", my professor already asked me what the difference between a tree and a trie is. \n\nAt this point, I have no clue. It seems like the words are used interchangeably, apparently since the publication of the Yellowpaper. Is it because ""trie"" is shorter and he didn't want to type out ""modified Merkle Patricia Tree"" every time? Is it supposed to show that Ethereum uses a ""modified Merkle Patricia tree"" instead of an ordinary ""Merkle Patricia tree""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ipp6gc/modified_merkle_patricia_tree_aka_trie_y/,1,5
