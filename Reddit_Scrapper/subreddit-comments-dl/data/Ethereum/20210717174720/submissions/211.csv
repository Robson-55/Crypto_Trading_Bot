It would be worth it if I could get around 70$+ usd monthly. Is it possible with this gpu? If yes what coin should I mine? If not what gpu do I need in a gaming pc that could also mine profitably?\n\nI'm new to all this so everything is much appreciated. I was redirected to here from r/coinbase.

jwaxox,1605681755,Completely forgot how to access my ETH coins. Please help...,"Hi Everyone,\n\nI bought some ETH tokens back in 2017 on Coinbase and then decided to move it to a wallet? at the advise of my friend. It seems like I overcomplicated things for myself since retrieving them has become a mystery for me after 3 years...I think I remember using one or a combination these: MetaMask and MyEtherWallet.com\n\nHere's what I still have:\n\nPrintout of something from MyEtherWallet.com which has two QR codes (my address and private key), as well as those two things in alphanumeric form.\n\nI also saved a text file on my computer called MetaM.txt, which contains a series of 12 words, a string of 42 numbers/letters.\n\nA file with a weirdass name (starts with UTC) and weird extension. I think this is the JSON file I saw someone mention in another post and that I shouldnt open it. (Unfortunately, I already did... didnt alter the file so not sure if that messed anything up)\n\nI tried fumbling my way around the MetaMask addin and MyEtherWallet.com to recover my wallet/tokens but havent had any luck... either said wrong key or JSON or when something did look like it worked the amount of ETH says zero... so either my tokens got jacked somehow during that time or I'm doing something wrong. Can someone please point me in the right direction? \n\nThanks in advance,\n\nStupidN00B",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jwaxox/completely_forgot_how_to_access_my_eth_coins/,7,24
