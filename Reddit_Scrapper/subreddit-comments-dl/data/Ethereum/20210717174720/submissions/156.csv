iy1hbt,1600827133,Best practices for sending stable coins?,"I'm wondering if there are any methods to make sending stable coins, notably USDC, more secure?  So far my best idea is to split the transaction into smaller amounts.  \n\nI guess I'm worried about a mistake when I copy and paste the address, and potentially malware that would intercept and change the address.

iyksei,1600900262,Need Feedback About Something Concerning EIP-2535 Diamond Standard,"Right now when using a diamond from [EIP-2535 Diamond Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535), and using the diamondCut function to remove functions from a diamond, should trying to remove a function that already does not exist cause the transaction to revert? Or should it be a noop and the transaction succeeds?\n\nWhen trying to replace a function with the same function using the same facet, should the transaction succeed or should it be a noop and the transaction succeeds?\n\nUpgrades should be done in a careful, intentional way, so it makes sense to me to revert in these cases. But if it does not revert then the diamondCut function is a little more flexible. What do you think?\n\nHere's how it is currently written in EIP-2535 Diamond Standard:\n\n&gt;The diamondCut function does nothing if a supplied function selector is already associated with the supplied facet address. The diamondCut function does nothing if a supplied function selector can’t be removed because it already does not exist.\n\nI am thinking of changing this in the standard so that these cases revert.
