nyjjox,1623540450,Beginner question about a token in my wallet and how it got there,"Hello,\n\nA few years ago I bought some ethereum and I just went to check in on it and it shows I now own a little more than 2 ""Livepeer"" tokens. I looked Livepeer up and it appears to be some video streaming platform thing that I am completely unfamiliar with. I have never transacted in Ethereum other than buying it and transferring it to my hardware wallet. Dod something happen that would have caused me to acquire Livepeer?

nylobt,1623547591,Exchanges using trading pairs to keep BTC in the front?,"I am curious if exchanges being basically centralized banks in a decentralized economy may be using trading pairs and their exchange coins to steal money. Vast regulations on exchanges and what they are allowed to own, trade and sell need to be put in place fast. One only needs to look at Bitcoin to see it is at the point of being traded with bots to create volume to pamp up the price with little purchases after every sell. Then I found this article below and tether was just kicked out of NY. These fraudsters seem like they are ruining crypto. If this is true can the projects do anything about phony coins on their blockchain from purchasing the blockchain? Think about it, tether is printed on Ethereum and then used to buy Ethereum but there is not a dollar behind the stable coin. In fact they printed so much tether after the Bitcoin crash to buy Bitcoin it was bizarre. Tethers are never burned like other stable coins it seems, they just keep printing more never needing to burn them? They basically stole Ethers with counterfeit dollars printed on its own network using a central bank and exchanges. They can sell them at any price now they need to to keep bringing in cash to pay people off.\n\nhttps://www.singlelunch.com/2021/05/19/the-tether-ponzi-scheme/",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nylobt/exchanges_using_trading_pairs_to_keep_btc_in_the/,1,4
