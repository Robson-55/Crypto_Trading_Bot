ncn3m4,1621039143,Sent TRX as an ERC20 token to Bittrex Ethereum address and now they are stuck.,I had a ledger that had some Tron as an ERC20 token on it that I recently accessed to sell the tokens. I bought them before the main net launched and when I went to transfer them to my TRX wallet in Bittrex it gave me an error saying that I needed to send the tokens to an ETH address. I read online that the exchanges would convert them to the main net tokens but Bittrex didn't convert them and their support is impossible to get ahold of ( have a ticket open for almost a week now).
