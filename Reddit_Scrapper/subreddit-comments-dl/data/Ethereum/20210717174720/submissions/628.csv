n7xu5o,1620505944,I bought ETH on PayPal. Is that a dumb thing to do.,I started buying ETH a couple of months ago on PayPal. Just $20 to $30 at a time. It just kept going up and up. So we came into a little bit of money and I asked my husband if we could buy a share or coin of ETH. I wasn't even sure if PayPal would let me buy that amount but it did. So now I own a little bit over a coin and now I'm worried that I bought it on the wrong platform. Everyone is talking about wallets and it you don't have one then you really don't own it anyway but can still buy or sell. Do you think that I should have bought it from somewhere else? I still want to buy one more if it goes back down a little bit (if that actually happens) and want to know should I get a wallet and buy from a different site. Thanks for anyone answering my questions. I appreciate it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n7xu5o/i_bought_eth_on_paypal_is_that_a_dumb_thing_to_do/,1,155
