mt0bt1,1618697620,Is a first deposit fee normal?,Just getting into Ethereum and crypto. I downloaded Argent bc it's open source and I want something I can buy eth directly from my wallet.\n\nIt's telling me there's a .0371 eth fee on my first deposit. Is this typical? Should I be using another wallet?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mt0bt1/is_a_first_deposit_fee_normal/,1,19

mt1d75,1618701290,Maybe my best investment in 2021,"I stumbled across the project StudentCoin. Seems to be the biggest ICO 2021. Maybe my best investment in 2021.\n\nThe project is unique in the crypto space and if it starts to get more attention it can become a very popular coin.\n\n- Anybody can create their own token on top of StudentCoin via a web interface. No programming skills required. \n- If you stake StudentCoin (STC) you earn from all transactions of the tokens on top of STC. \n- Students are the future and bring innovation and proper use cases.\n- They are planning to build an education program to make students early learn about blockchain.. so they probably will use STC to build interesting projects on top of it.\n¬† \nIn two weeks they just launched their wallet, mobile app and announced 3 exchange listings.\n\nThe team confirmed that STC is going to be listed on 9 new exchanges from the top 50 (a few from them are top 20 and top 10) from May 2021.\n\nTheir presale is currently live and 145 of 150 phases are finished.\n\nA review is nothing without negative points and criticisms:\n\n- Communication of the team could be improved\n\n- There is a lot of FUD.. The team could just clear this up better and comment on all the criticisms. To improve that they are planning to make a team interview series from next week to be closer to the community.\n\n- The 500 universities are not all real partners.. they just have students from those universities as supporter.. its not clear which universities are partners\n\nThe ico price is still really low with 0.021 USD.\n\nA small portion of the circulating supply is beeing traded on CoinTiger and Uniswap for 0.03 USD already and went up to $0.07 some days ago.\n\nStudentCoin is already on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/\n\nStudentCoin Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/studentcoinorg\n\nThere are three options to participate:\n\n- buy STC via Credit Card\n\n- send ETH from your MetaMask wallet\n\n- send any crypto to the Coinbase Commerce payment method\n\nI just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay the package.\n\nI recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.\n\nCoinbase Commerce works also for US investors.\n\nUse this bonus code to get 5% more at the purchase.\n\nCODE: Sxlb8setj7\n\nProject page: [https://studentcoin.app](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sxlb8setj7)\n\n\n** This is not a financial advice.

mt3ovg,1618710160,Unique Recover Ether Question,"Howdy all! Hoping someone can help. I'm a newbie to Crypto. Back in 2017 I bought some Ether on a whim. I bought it with Coinbase and transferred it to my Mist Ether wallet (I had no idea what I was doing).\n\nI remember back it seemed like it never fully made it to the wallet. It would download forever and never quite get there.\n\nI recently gained access to my old Coinbase account, and it confirms that the Ether was sent. I then double checked with Etherscan and it shows the transfer as complete. When I boot up my old hard-drive with the Mist wallet (I verified that the address was indeed correct) but it does not have the Ether, nor does it ever show in the transaction history that it ever received it. Now Mist wallet is no more.\n\nIs there a way to attempt to recover this Ether?\n\nThanks for the help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mt3ovg/unique_recover_ether_question/,1,0

I've noticed over the last couple of months that my payouts (as measured in Eth) are consistently getting smaller.  Obviously the price of Eth has shot up so i'm wondering if the payouts to the pool are somehow tied to a dollar value at any given moment?
