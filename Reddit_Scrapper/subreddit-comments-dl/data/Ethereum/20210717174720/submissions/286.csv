krv7d7,1609961300,"I invite you to a thought experiment, what would be the domino effect if the largest stablecoin loses it's peg overnight?","I'm aware most of you are tired of the FUD about USDT (tether) that ramped up recently. But let's make a fun thought experiment and try to imagine the domino effect as far as possible, what would happen  if USDT  loses it's peg or even becomes clear that is worth nothing or close to nothing at 15th Jan, when is the deadline for iFinex (the parent company of Tether and Bitfinex) to submit the requested documentation to NYAG (New Your Attorney General) that US authorities requested in the middle of 2019 and iFinex has been using all possible ways to delay that until now. Few fun facts to get your thinking started with:\n\n\- They've been delaying providing those docs for 1.5 years, given that track record I find it unlikely they will provide them now, or that they will be up to satisfaction.\n\n\- They've been ramping USDT printing exponentially in the last 6 months, $1B tether printed just the first few days of this year. For an outsider it looks like they know shit is about to hit the fan and want to buy as much unseizable crypto assets as possible before the end.\n\n\- Market cap when they admitted they have only 76% backing in 2018 was $2B, it's $22B now \n\n\- USDT is by far having the biggest trading volume against any crypto\n\n\- Their last ""audit"" was in 2018 and it looked like a joke, they actually never provided proper audit of their reserves, never.\n\n\- They always mint tether in big round number, like $800M just the other day. I find it hard to believe that deposits of investors always add-up to a round number. Look USDC mints for example, they are always like 23939394\n\n\- Nobody seems to know where they bank right now? (Correct me if you know)\n\n\- USDT is in lots of AMM DEX pools with other stables, if USDT loses it's peg and goes to $0, the other stable in that pool will lose it's peg to by going much above $1, so that even can single handedly cause all stables to lose their pegs\n\n\- That will cause a lot of people that have borrowed other stables against crypto to be undercollaterized, which will liquadate their crypto collateral at market price, causing the price of that crypto to tank, cause other people to be under-collaterized and so on.....the domino is quite obvious here.\n\n\- There is a lot of BTC on Ethereum in various forms, some of them based on collateral, that collateral might depreciate way too fast, what would happen to the BTC on ethereum?\n\n\- nobody seems to have used [tether.to](https://tether.to) to  redeem USDT for USD?\n\n\- a lot of exchanges rely heavily on USDT \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne train of thought seems to be everyone will pour their depreciating USDT in crypto causing the prices to go even higher, but who will take it? Well AMM LP will be the first to suffer I suppose but what happens on  CEXes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe opposite and much harder to forsee domino effect will be the doomsday scenario, all stables losing their peg, mass liquadations, halted trading at CEXes and so on, but how far could that potentially reach effect wise? How long it can last?   \nPlease try to forsee the domino effect as far as possible as a fun thought experiment.\n\nHopefully nothing will happen at 15th or at least the US government won't react harshly knowing what that would cause, but still would be better to be prepared for all possible scenarios and excersize our thinking in the process.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/krv7d7/i_invite_you_to_a_thought_experiment_what_would/,1,14
