mu3gug,1618847122,Staking vs interest accounts,"I've had 1 eth staked for about 4 months now amd recently I stumbled upon blockfi and their compound interest intrigued me. Naturally I decided to see how the 2 would stack up so I threw 1 eth on blockfi about 1 month ago... so far I've made 10.93 worth of eth which will be added to my total eth at the end of the month ( started mid-month so I added my total so far, as I have already gained some interest from march) anyway, i have not made a cent of interest on coinbase through my 1 staked eth nor can i withdraw my staked eth. Still waiting to see the interest I accrue on the eth when it actually happens. Any thoughts?

mu4pbl,1618850476,How convince my friends to buy productive coins like ETH instead of Dogecoin,All my friends recently got into crypto but they keep falling for every new Binance shitcoin that pops up and sending dogecoin updates in the group chat. Im having a morale dilemma on whether I should really put in some effort to explain to them that most of these coins are garbage and will hit 0 during the next crypto winter or should i just let them figure it out. \n\nI've been leaning to the latter but I feel like throwing them to the wolves might just discourage them from crypto but like the alternative makes me come off as a buzz kill. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to handle this?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mu4pbl/how_convince_my_friends_to_buy_productive_coins/,1,626

mu7fgl,1618857816,What will Cryptocurrency and Ethereum be like in 5 years?,"For the last five years I've wondered where it's all going, and of course, there's much that's happened that I never expected (NFTs, for example). I thought we'd all have blockchain enabled websites, which probably isn't going to happen, at least, not in the foreseeable future. I didn't see how big of issue scaling would become, I knew it would be an issue, but not like this. \n\nBut what about you? What do you think cryptocurrency will look like in 5 years?\n\n* Will the majority of major companies be interacting via L2 services to Ethereum?\n* Will Bitcoin fall to a subordinate position to Ethereum (this one seems pretty obvious to me, but who knows, maybe you still see a ""store of value"" favoring an old chunky chain over a useful one.\n* Will other blockchains survive in reasonable market share or will interoperating L2s make their ""uniqueness"" and pitch irrelevant?\n* Will Bank of America be offering a stable-coin checking/savings account, with 1% interest for staking via savings (lol, hey, that's probably a good idea Bank of America, you can tip me if you're reading this)\n\nI would love to hear your vision for cryptocurrency for 2026.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mu7fgl/what_will_cryptocurrency_and_ethereum_be_like_in/,1,72
