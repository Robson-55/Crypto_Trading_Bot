grg7ce,1590570190,How To Maximize Profits From Liquidity Provision,"Jelly Swap releases new market making software in order to maximize the profit from the spreads and to make the market more competitive. It is an automated software is called Butler and comes as an easy to set up desktop application for liquidity provision. To earn as a market maker is one of the most profitable ways in the crypto sphere and Butler works in a different manner than Uniswap and other exchanges which makes things even better. Have a look at the advantages of Butler:   \n\- As a market maker you will be free to choose the spread (rather than Uniswap where the spreads are fixed) Thus, the rates provided on Jelly will be much more flexible than other platforms.  \n\- Market makers will earn bonuses from our incentive program - 12.6% annualy for the first 100k liquidity provided (the highest interest rate out there)  \n\- Funds for liquidity provision are used only on demand. This means that market maker's funds will not be locked and he can meanwhile use them for other purposes. (all other platforms will lock your funds for a certain period of time)  \n\- Cross-exchange liquidity provision - market makers will be able to rebalance their portfolios on other centralized platforms and thus solve the problem with impermanent loss  \nThere is one disadvantage we have to mention: every market maker has to operate the node and keep it up and running all the time or with short downtimes  \nRead more here: [https://jellyswap.gitbook.io/liquidity/](https://jellyswap.gitbook.io/liquidity/)   \n [https://medium.com/jelly-market/market-making-incentive-program-fbef51f41448](https://medium.com/jelly-market/market-making-incentive-program-fbef51f41448)   \nTwitter:  [https://twitter.com/jelly\_swap](https://twitter.com/jelly_swap)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/grg7ce/how_to_maximize_profits_from_liquidity_provision/,1,0

griwbw,1590582882,ETH PRO DAPP,"  The ETH PRO (abbreviation for ETHEREUM PROFESSIONAL SMART CONTRACT DISTRIBUTED DIGITAL GAME) is the world’s first decentralized lottery game application embedding multiple mechanisms and deployed based on Ethereum network. The ETH PRO was initially designed to create a brand new decentralized smart contract platform that would be fair, equitable and transparent without cheating or tampering, and could be operated sustainably. Those who participate in the ETH PRO only support the world’s second largest cryptocurrency - ETH. The settlement and withdrawal of rewards are also carried out in ETH. The ETH PRO deployed based on Ethereum network creatively combines mechanisms of six protocols and two funds, including the distributed protocol, the redemption protocol, the EPRO protocol, the Bancor protocol, the TOP protocol, the treasure chest protocol, the insurance fund and the ecological development fund. These creative integrating designs truly enable all participated ETHs to be assigned 100% to each community member whose ETH quantity can be enlarged quickly and equitably with the continuous precipitation and accumulation of time. Each community member is able to realize the distributed multiplication of a participated ETH by ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times, ten thousand times and even a million times through the ETH PRO distributed application. Meanwhile, with the slow implementation of ETH 2.0, the ETH value will grow over time and the ETH quantity participating in the ETH PRO will realize distributed multiplication. The total value of your ETHs will also grow continuously, and you can finally realize your wealth life of huge digital assets.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/griwbw/eth_pro_dapp/,1,1
