lcgu5z,1612449088,Ethereum Discussion Area (Problems with Ethereum),"Hello guys, i got into Ethereum last year as i was recommended to do a Final Year Project using Smart Contracts on Ethereum and it was at that moment i began researching about ETH and blockchain everyday. The more i research the more i realize the potential of Ethereum as a whole and there are many reasons that proves that Ethereum is way undervalued and will gain mass adoption in the future. But recently i also start to wonder what if the problem with ETH scalability issue can't be solved in time? Due to postpone of EIP1559 or ETH 2.0 and users of Ethereum start losing interest in it. What is the possibility of this happening and if this scenario does play out Eth might be in deep trouble. I am willing to accept all forms of feedback and discussion here so feel free to leave any constructive feedback or criticisms in my statement. Oh and what other problems with Ethereum can you guys think of, also suggest it here on this thread.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lcgu5z/ethereum_discussion_area_problems_with_ethereum/,7,15

We are launching a card game soon and we are hoping to start processing crypto as payment. However, being the forward thinker I am I'd like to have a multisig solution with hardware wallets in order to maintain integrity.
