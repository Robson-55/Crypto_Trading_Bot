What is the Best platform staking?\n2. which of these platforms offer staking without moving tokens into their exchange? (would like to keep tokens on ledger wallet and use Metamask for staking contract)\n3. I have received invite for Coinbase staking and I believe current return is 6%. Is this AFTER fees is taken by Coinbase?\n4. Is coinbase staking real staking or just interest? (would like to avoid services such as [https://celcius.network](https://celcius.network/) )\n5. with coinbase staking, is there a risk of loosing your original eth tokens?\n6. If I decide to stake on Coinbase, any rough idea when I would be able to withdraw?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n2ulsa/questions_on_staking/,1,13

But I cant find the LEND on my Ledger..? It seems like LEND doesnt even exist?\n\nWhats going on here? Did I miss something while I was gone!? Am I fucked? I kept CoinStats updated religiously so if I wrote that I had 980 LEND than I know I have it. Can someone help? Thank you!\n\nKeep in my that before I went away I was somewhat savvy, but its been 2 years and no technology then so I‚Äôm a little slow and trying to relearn everything (if your a scammer, dont even try.
