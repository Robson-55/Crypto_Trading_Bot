Is this going to be an Ethereum upgrade or a new network launch? I have read some articles about Optimism and as far as I understood it‚Äôs a new Network? If it is a new network launch then how can I bridge all the assets when it comes out? If so, not all erc-20 tokens will be available in the new net which means it‚Äôs slghtly useless like BSC? Is there a date on when all these will be released? Can someone explain these very simply?

m410wo,1615618114,It‚Äôs my first time... I‚Äôm kind of nervous,I have never invested in anything before and am interested in crypto. I do not know very much however with the increasing popularity of NFTs and using crypto to purchase things online I figured now is the time. \n\nFrom what I have read the majority of people are expecting Ethereum to make a leap similar to Bitcoin had this past year. How realistic is it for Ethereum to reach let‚Äôs say 10k by the end of 2022? I want to focus on one crypto and just continue to stock up on it throughout the year. \n\nBesides $ETH and $BTC what other cryptos should I research. I want to play it safe. $ETH I believe has brightest immediate future but I am interested in feedback. I could use reliable resources and knowledgeable experts that have helped some of you.\nMuch appreciated,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/m410wo/its_my_first_time_im_kind_of_nervous/,1,18
