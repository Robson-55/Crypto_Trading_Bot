nvzn99,1623255246,"Is native scalibility ever going to be possible with ethereum without sacrificing decentralization, speed, security, or composability?","I have a significant amount invested in eth, and I think Vitalik and team are geniuses, but I keep hearing that one leg of the trilemma always needs to be sacrificed and that you can't have all 3. Meanwhile I've since stumbled upon projects like Radix which is a DLT claiming they've ""solved"" the trilemma at scale. Fully sharded L1 protocol would mean composability at scale, which I think is ethereum's biggest weakness.\n\nThere is unbelievably strong network effects on ethereum, but if people keep using sidechains, rollups, etc then it becomes less about eth and more about the individual apps and what they can accomplish with these other techs.\n\nIs it possible for eth to eventually fork to a full L1 sharded protocol that can be scaled well?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nvzn99/is_native_scalibility_ever_going_to_be_possible/,1,73

nw3cf8,1623264849,Stablecoin Concept [x-post from r/ethdev],"Quick preface: first-time poster here, please let me know if there’s anything I should change.\n\nOne of the biggest factors preventing crypto from widespread adaptation is volatility. Plenty of stablecoins have tried to solve this, but they’ve all had some sort of issue. They’re either centralized, can’t hold a peg, insanely vulnerable to external financial shock, or some combination. I have what I think is a new idea for a stablecoin, and I’d like some feedback.\n\nThe basic concept of relatively simple: instead of using oracles or collateral to maintain a peg, we fix the cost of creating a new coin to $1.\n\nThe coin would be mineable. According to Moore’s law, computing power increases at a relatively stable rate, so the mining difficulty could be adjusted daily by a contract to ensure that the price of mining a new coin is always $1.\n\nI’m not entirely sure if this makes sense, and it’s definitely a very early idea that certainly has numerous issues. I’d appreciate any feedback I can get.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nw3cf8/stablecoin_concept_xpost_from_rethdev/,1,5
