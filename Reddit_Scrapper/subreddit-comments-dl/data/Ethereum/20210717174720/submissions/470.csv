m62yq3,1615877241,Ethereum in the 2021 Ultimate Crypto Tournament,"Hi everyone, forgive the shameless announcement, but I’m a real person doing this and a nerd for tournaments. The only way I know to let people know about this is to blast messages. If this gets more downvotes than upvotes, I’ll F off.\n\nThat said, guess what…it’s tourney time and you’re in!\n\nEthereum is the #1 seed in its own bracket. Your opponent is 16 seed Nexo. Last year, ETH made it to the Elite 8. Good luck this year!\n\nIf you’re familiar with March Madness, or remember this from last year, you’ll get it right away. If not, this is how it works: Starting tonight at midnight, on Twitter @ UltimateCrypto7, there will be a poll for each game, open to all. The coin receiving more votes after 3 days will be declared the winner and move on.\n\nLike last year, the Ultimate Crypto Tournament pits the top 64 coins (by market cap) in a single elimination tournament. Crypto is a collaborative, cooperative space with room for all, but we can still have some fun.\n\nSo, vote early, tell your friends, and may the best coin win! The games begin at midnight tonight and run until 11:59 pm PT March 18.\n\n[https://twitter.com/UltimateCrypto7](https://twitter.com/UltimateCrypto7) or at\n\n[https://ultimatecrypto.fun/](https://ultimatecrypto.fun/)\n\nCheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/m62yq3/ethereum_in_the_2021_ultimate_crypto_tournament/,1,0

m64s8t,1615885477,How did the devs never see this coming?,So I'm no expert but to my understanding the gas fees are high because the network is heavily congested? Less than 1 percent of the world has adopted crypto and a fraction of this 1% happen to send ETH transactions. Did they not anticipate the network becoming like this and did they not have a backup plan? It's honestly unjustifiable and there has to be bad actors at play. Whom are the bad actors it 100% cannot wholey be the communitys buying NFT's and Shit coins.
