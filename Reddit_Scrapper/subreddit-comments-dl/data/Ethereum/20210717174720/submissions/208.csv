jut7d7,1605473301,The opinion of someone who actually uses the Ethereum network like a regular bank.,"I use Ethereum weekly and I would easily say I'm someone whos here primarily for the usecase rather than an investment vehicle.\n\nIm paid every week in Dai from my employer for the work I've completed that week. \n\nDefi is an awsome way to earn interest without having to go back to centralised services. \n\nHowever, the one thing that keeps me coming back to regular banks is privacy. I absolutely hate that my employer can see all my funds and I have to pay upwards of $20 to wash money through tornado cash everytime (while uniswap trades are below $5).\n\nIf it wasn't for the lack of privacy I would have literally no reason to ever leave the ecosystem and with PayPal payments coming soon I'll no longer need to buy giftcards to buy from non-crypto stores.\n\nIts disappointing that the focus with L2s is 500+ TPS. $0.77 fees for transactions aren't even that much of an issue, it's slightly inconvenient but it's not off putting. Why can't L2s offer 50TPS but private transfer, it's privacy that's over priced not regular transfers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jut7d7/the_opinion_of_someone_who_actually_uses_the/,40,48

juztyb,1605498033,Do I have to put my private key in my ETH node? Is that safe?,"I know for ETH 2 you are supposed to be able to run a validator node, that makes a digital signature if the blocks in that shard are ok. I don't know if I understand correctly, but does that mean my account private key would need to be on the node software itself?\n\nLike lets say I usually would use a hardware wallet for my funds, to make sure nobody can break into it. But now, in order for my account to be a validator, I need to be able to put that private key on the node itself. The node is obviously open to the internet, somebody might be able to break in and get the key right? I mean I guess I could make another account just for the node, but if my block rewards are going there, I would have to keep emptying it every time it makes some money in case somebody hacks the key.\n\nAt a certain point does it make more sense for the node to have its own private key, which is not an account key at all? Maybe the account key that put Eth to be a validator could sign another public key for its node to use, but that key that it signed, doesn't have any money itself. I don't know if that makes sense hahaha.\n\nI'm curious if it works the way I think (node just has an account address and private key), or if the node has its own public key, and why it was decided to work that way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/juztyb/do_i_have_to_put_my_private_key_in_my_eth_node_is/,18,10
