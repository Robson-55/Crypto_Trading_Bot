kyt1na,1610836399,First Ethereum Dapp (Contributor Credits),"Hi guys,\n\nTwo friends and I have finished our first DApp, called *Contributor Credits* ([www.contributorcredits.com](https://www.contributorcredits.com)). \n\nThe idea is to give (hobby / side) projects a way of giving stake in their success without jumping through the legal hurdles of issuing equity (or even founding an entity). Contributor credits makes it very easy to create a new token so project owners can pay their contributors with a promise of future payment (if the venture is successful).\n\nOptionally, these tokens can be partially funded (by a backing stable coin). Once an agreed upon trigger is reached (investment or yearly revenue for example) the issuing party is required to fully fund the Contributor credits (i.e. match the issued tokens with the backing stable coin).\n\nThe project is very much MVP stage, but if you guys want to give it a spin on Ropsten we would be very glad to get some feedback! The source code of the smart contract can be found here: [https://github.com/sunshine-labs/cc-smart-contract](https://github.com/sunshine-labs/cc-smart-contract) (any feedback here is also very welcome)\n\nFinally, if you happen to have a fun side project that could use our system, please let us know!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kyt1na/first_ethereum_dapp_contributor_credits/,2,27

kyuclz,1610840572,Am I a prisoner in the ETH network?,"Hello people,\n\nGas fees are currently quite high, which makes it almost impossible to perform transactions effectively.\n\nYes, even switching to alternatives (L2, Cardano, Polkadot) is associated with high gas fees.\n\nI am a big fan of Ethereum, but these gas fees are absolute hell.\n\nAnd currently there are good alternatives that are technologically more advanced than Ethereum such as Polkadot that already have their parachains now (which Ethereum doesn't want to bring until around 2023?).\n\nI decided to take some ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum and invest in ADA/DOT. However, I will leave my ETH (just not reinvest it).\n\nBut now I feel like a prisoner in the Ethereum network. Trading for say DAI to sell it and then buying DOT/ADA has absolutely high gas costs. For the smallest amounts, you already pay over $11 in fees. Same for changing to L2 inside Ethereum (I did, paid $1 for 40 gwei but had to wait \~2 hours)\n\nIs there no way to get out of the network cheaply? :'D\n\nAlso, what are your thoughts about alternatives like Cardano or Polkadot compared to ETH 2.0?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kyuclz/am_i_a_prisoner_in_the_eth_network/,2,18

kyvnyj,1610844894,Tracking missing transaction,Hi all I need some help tracking down an old transactions. When I open my wallet on Jaxx the deposit transaction is there but when i open it on Exodus its not showing up. I keep getting a  TX-019 error message when trying to send my ETH from Jaxx today. The transaction ID 0x8877252a391ee844d79a24d072577120e6986a5b7fc8c0234b3f26f59f185e5d\n\nI can see a BTC transaction  in my wallet for a very similar amount an hour before. I'm guessing I used shapeshift on Jaxx to trade BTC for ETH. Is there a way I can confirm this?

I used something called 'mist etherum wallet', but a quick google suggests that it's deprecated/no longer in dev. The etherum website lists like dozens of wallets to pick from and I have no idea what the difference is ???  \n\n\nCan someone point me to a guide about what the best / safest way is now to get access to my eth again and sell it?
