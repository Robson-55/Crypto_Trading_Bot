Does it really need to be super decentralized since it’s not trying to dethrone fiat?  Is there a resource that talks about this and whether Ethereum is decentralized enough to resist governments?\n\nResource about the game theory of cex vs dex when long run cex will probably be free for customers like traditional exchanges have become. \n\nResource/answer about who would use double collateralized crypto loans when the possibility of exponential investment returns is gone\n\nThanks!,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/imiuw9/i_have_a_couple_questionsrequest_for_resources_if/,1,0
