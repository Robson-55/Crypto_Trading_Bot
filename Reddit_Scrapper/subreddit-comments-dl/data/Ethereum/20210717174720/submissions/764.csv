nwoll3,1623334271,Why do some projects like to have their liquidity staked?,"Help me understand this.\n\nI provide liquidity for project X with an ETH pairing at 50:50 X/ETH on Uniswap. In return I receive LP-Tokens for 50:50 X/ETH that represent the value of my liquidity + fees earned. I will need these LP-Tokens to pull out my liquidity + fees earned at any given time and move on.\n\nNow, project X has a partner program called project XY ( they work together within the same ecosystem). Project XY offers me to earn XY Tokens if I were to ""stake"" my LP-Tokens from project X with them.\n\n***Here are my questions:***\n\nHow and Why does Staking work with LP-Tokens? ( in nuanced detail would be great )\n\nWhy would Project XY like to have Project X's LP-Tokens staked with them?

nwoway,1623335055,"Online Pseudonym Parties fully implemented half a year ago, and game theory around ""proof-of-unique-human""","In my own opinion, Ethereum project collapsed a bit when the majority of the validators chose to break the hash chain continuity in 2016, and chose to create something like a (very complicated) second genesis block on block number 1920000. And that since then, it's been whoever shouts the loudest that gets attention. This is fine, I chose to prioritize other things instead.\n\nI finished my proof-of-unique-human system half a year ago, full implementation: [https://snippet.host/tqcr](https://snippet.host/tqcr). For anyone interested in working on that, there you have the source code.\n\nA lot of people seem to believe a web-of-trust is a good basis for majority vote-type systems. It really isn't. Webs-of-trust are great for other things, but, for ""centralized"" proof-of-unique-human"" it is probably dead in the water. See ""[proofofhumanity.id](https://proofofhumanity.id)"" or ""BrightID"", and probably a few others. I chose the opposite approach, basically to start from the *exact opposite* of a web-of-trust.\n\nOn that last note, what Satoshi (Craig Wright) has said over and over, is that so many people \*wanted\* his invention to be a ""web of trust"". Because people *like* webs-of-trust, you are in control in those. But you can't use them for everything. And you cannot use them for majority vote, was my conclusion.\n\nJust a heads up, if anyone is interested in the proof-of-unique-human problem, game theoretically.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nwoway/online_pseudonym_parties_fully_implemented_half_a/,2,15
