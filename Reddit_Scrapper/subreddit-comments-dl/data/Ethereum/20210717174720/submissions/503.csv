HOW do I keep these buggers safe? I‚Äôd love to use an IOS app for ease but I‚Äôve seen several security cases AGAINST, but the idea of a single hardware asset maintaining all my funds?!? \n\n1) How do I establish redundancy for my funds safety? \n\nI‚Äôve read plenty of posts in this sub complaining about beginners but nothing with a JARGON FREE explanation. After weeks of reading I still can‚Äôt seem to get all the terminology so, this post exists. \n\n2) I am also very confused on how the profits are taxed. (American but I‚Äôm purchasing while living in the EU)\n\nWhile I understand these are big questions, I‚Äôm very confident in ETH and excited to get help. I‚Äôd also be willing to compensate someone for some coaching/guidance, so let me know if that interests anyone. I don‚Äôt wanna end up poor or in jail.... just fat and happy with a full ETH wallet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ml6bn5/noob_jumping_in_both_feet/,1,29
