I've tried Loopring, xDai and Optimism.\n\nPlease do point out any misunderstandings I may have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Why did so many L2 solutions seemingly get ""mainnet ready"" around the same time? Did I just not pay attention, or is it just a really close race?\n* For the ZK based L2s....\n   * Whats the difference? Its ZK-rollups. What makes them different from one another?\n   * Who makes the proof? Is this process decentralized?\n   * Is it correct that the proofs are submitted onto L1, and that based on them I could, in theory, recreate all the merkle trees to prove my claim for some amount of assets?\n* For xDai...\n   * It focuses around DAI, and from my understanding you bridge DAI, but otherwise you can pretty much do whatever you would do on mainnet. Why the choice of staying with DAI if it is compatible for all assets? Why not just bridge ETH, and then do L2 swaps for DAI?\n   * Is it really just the mainnet with different ""decentralization parameters""? Different consesus, but way way faster?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any help understanding!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l284cy/understanding_the_l2_solutions/,1,0

l2a962,1611270508,SERIOUS QUESTION: How Do I Import Ethereum private key to a wallet without the QR code/how to fix mist white screen on windows 8.1?,"Hey everyone, so i have a question and have been looking everywhere but cant seem to find an answer. I have seen people with similar issues relating to thei bitcoin, but no one seems to be dealing with eth. \n\nSo i pulled up my old laptop, and tried to open up my ethereum core/mist wallet but am met with a blank white screen. (Not allowed to add the image for some reason...)\n\nHowever, i saved the private key in a text file and have access to the key and nemonic but without the qr code. I also have the keystore file but since im having issues opening the actual wallet, i cant even transfer it (drag and drop) into mist. I get an error saying please manually install geth 1.8.23 (which i did) but the screen remains blank. I even tried reinstalling the whole wallet altogether, but at this point i really would rather just use a web based wallet. Its going to take so much space and time to synchronize the blocks anyways. \n\nSo my question to you all is: \n\n1. Is there a way to fix the blank screen issue (On windows 8.1) \n\n2. Can i transfer my keystore to a usb and try installing the wallet on a different computer and then drag and drop the key store in there (or even to an online wallet such as blockchain or coinbase, etc.) \n\n3. Is there a wallet or app that i can use to transfer my ethereum directly by inputting the private key manually? (literally by typing in the private key address)Â  I should also mention that there is a chance that there are seperate alt coins attached to this address, but i honestly am not sure since its over 3 years old. \n\nThat's essentially all, im so curious to see how much ether i have in this wallet and it's driving me nuts not being able to check! \n\nThanks and sorry for the long post!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l2a962/serious_question_how_do_i_import_ethereum_private/,1,4
