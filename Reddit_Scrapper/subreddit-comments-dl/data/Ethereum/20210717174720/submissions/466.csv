m53rdq,1615754579,Why Shouldn't I Take 90% Royalties on Secondary Sales (Mintable)??,"There is no explanation on the royalty adjust bar. I can take 0% - 90% royalties on secondary  sales of my own NFT artwork. Can someone please explain? As I am looking for a profit, why wouldn't I try to accumulate the highest royalty?\n\nI suppose a seller would have no incentive to resell my item if they make *nothing* because I have tied up all the funds (90% royalty)? Is that how this works? So if I set royalty down at 25%, a buyer of my NFT would likely resell it right away because the royalty amount that I could potentially receive would go to them?\n\nHow does this work and what is a realistic royalty % average to set??? Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/m53rdq/why_shouldnt_i_take_90_royalties_on_secondary/,1,20
