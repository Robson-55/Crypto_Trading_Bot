nrtlbc,1622770801,Videographer planning to film cryptocurrency series.,"My name is Andrew I am a cryto-enthusiast/videographer. I have been immensely interested in crypto but still very green (only have researched for a few years about it) I have been working on a project that can benefit everyone in the crypto-verse. It’s something that I’ve taken about a year to iron out the details but also to let things get a little more normal since Covid made things difficult for everyone. Im going to travel to all major cities in the US to and I want to interview a handful of crypto enthusiasts ranging (from people who have no clue about it , to someone who might be reading this that feels they have a lot to say who might not get the opportunity to.  I also plan to interview some local business who might be interested in integrating cryptos into their models. I think we need more ground soldiers in this early crypto space. I think it’s also a huge opportunity for exposure to other coins that have the potential to change the world but might not have the networking channels. I truly feel passionate enough to try and see how far I can make a difference. I’m not by any means trying to be a crypto shaman or know it all preaching to the public. I want exposure to this crazy new technology that so many people can’t even begin to understand. I enjoy videography, I studied humanities and communications in college, and I feel I have a proper understanding of crypto to format interesting questions on the topic for educational purposes. If anyone has any ideas,questions, or possibly lives in (or near) a big city feel free to reach out! Thank you. I’ve learned a lot from you all and this is only the beginning. We are just setting the table.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nrtlbc/videographer_planning_to_film_cryptocurrency/,1,0

nry4b8,1622787025,What's the benefits of web3 beyond decentralization and privacy?,I've been doing a deep dive into ethereum. I came across web3 and it's really cool. I just see a huge down side in the cost of it. So for me to use web sites/web apps I need to pay a steady supply of gas fees? The big benefit seems to be privacy and decentralization. Like how 90% of the internet is being run on Azure or AWS right now. \n\nWhat other benefits are there that I'm not picking up? I'm currently exploring how to set up and browse dapps so I might have a better understanding once I see what kind of apps people are building. I love the idea but it's really difficult for me to get on board with the premise that my wallet will slowly get drained as I browse/interact with the internet with the only benefit being decentralization and privacy.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nry4b8/whats_the_benefits_of_web3_beyond/,1,3
