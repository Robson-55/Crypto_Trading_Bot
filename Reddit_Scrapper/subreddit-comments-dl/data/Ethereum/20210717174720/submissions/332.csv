l6swt0,1611827145,GME Trading - Best example of why we need Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs),"If during this whole process of /r/WallStreetBets attacking institutional short-selling assholes is not the best case for for decentralized exchanges (DEX’s) idk what is. The market making platforms literally halt trading on reddit stocks like GME, AMC, and BB multiple times during the trading session making it so you cannot trade the way you want. This usually happens when the short sellers trigger a huge sell off, and you bet your ass they have a mainline that’s directly plugged into the NYSE that is going to let them get out of their short positions faster than you can put your buy positions through so that they can mitigate their losses. Now we also have all these different banking platforms putting restrictions on your ability to buy and sell these stocks, the highest volume stocks ever, while having multiple platforms also crash or become unusable without them having to take any responsibility whatsoever (even though they seem to love taking those transaction fees). Nothing about this whole thing is transparent. DEX’s are coming, and while in their current form they are not there yet they will be especially when we add layer 2 solutions or get into phase 2. I can’t fucking wait. Ethereum is currently the best poised to take advantage of all of that and together we will have a different way of trading",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l6swt0/gme_trading_best_example_of_why_we_need/,1,142

l6xv63,1611843864,Need a little help,"Good day to all!\n\nFirst of all, I want to say that until recently I did not want to ask for any help, but I can not cope on my own\n\nMy name is Mikhail, I'm from Russia. I live in a small village near St. Petersburg. At the very beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, I suffered from this disease in a severe form.\n\nDuring the last year, I have been helping COVID-19 patients in my spare time. There are many elderly people living in my village and neighboring villages. There are a lot of cases of the disease, and often the disease is difficult.\n\nMany of these people do not have money for medicines, as they do not have the opportunity to come to the hospital. Local hospitals have few cars, doctors also do not have time to go around all the patients.\n\nI spend my free time and money helping the elderly. I take them to the hospital, I take the doctors from the local hospital to the patients ' homes, and sometimes I use my own money to buy medicines for people.\n\nIn general, I can do it, but there is one problem. I have an old diesel car with a lot of fuel consumption, and I have to spend a lot of money on trips. I'm trying to swap my car for the cheapest electric car, like the Nissan Leaf. But the amount from the sale of my car is not enough to buy it, and taking into account all my expenses, I can not save the necessary amount. The money is small, after the sale of my car, I will only need about 2 thousand dollars.\n\nThe cost of electricity is such that trips in an electric car will cost about 10 times cheaper than in my car. This would allow us to do our job more efficiently and allocate more funds for medicines.\n\nSince I am located in Russia, the easiest way to accept donations is BTC or ETH.\n\nIf someone reads this post and wants to help a little, I will be very grateful.\n\nIf someone donates at least $ 1, then together you can be of great help to a large number of people.\n\nHere are my wallets:\n\nBTC:  1Ghm3SpKx7tgbjJ8VhecqTECXxvhFT8f1d\n\nETH:  0xe36A1BcFBDAd97232973B522f87bebC09BCd1f47\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll say it again. I'm ashamed to ask for help and I'm trying to cope on my own. But my capabilities are unfortunately not enough. I will be very grateful if someone responds and helps a little.
