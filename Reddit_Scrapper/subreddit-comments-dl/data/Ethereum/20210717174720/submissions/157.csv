However, fewer column inches have been devoted to how distributed ledger technology and data decentralization stands to transform media itself; by bringing transparency, accountability and global digital transaction capability.\n\nYou‚Äôll find projects like [po.et](http://po.et/) who are preventing plagiarism and piracy online. Decentralized systems can benefit individual content creators as equally as bigger, more established players.\n\nHere‚Äôs how it works: Without quality data about the origin of the media clip in question, a system cannot automate the detection and deletion of pirated content. With blockchain technology, a public ledger can be an immutable reference as to when the content was originally uploaded and details on ownership. This is not only a powerful tool to prevent piracy, but also to prevent the false copyright strikes or takedown requests that plague many major media platforms today.\n\nWhere [blockchain stands to make the greatest impact in media is in digital advertising.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-an-online-ad-worth-blockchain-might-help-with-that-1529326800) Digital ledger technology stands to provide superior ad targeting and efficiency. Yet the $[192 billion digital advertising side of media](https://digitaglobal.com/state-us192-billion-digital-advertising-industry/) faces its own Internet-age travails. The world‚Äôs largest advertisers have voiced concerns about the rampant fraud and inefficiency of buying digital and social media.\n\nConsumer products giant [Procter &amp; Gamble cut its digital ad spend in 2017 by $200](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/when-procter-gamble-cut-200-million-in-digital-ad-spend-its-marketing-became-10-more-effective/) million in part over concerns about shadowy content views. Competitor Unilever has voiced similar misgivings. Bots generating bogus page views can render platform algorithms inaccurate and inflate the perceived value of sponsorships and brand partnerships with content creators, making for ineffective digital ad spend on the part of the advertiser‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand ultimately, disrupted ad flow for the media outlet.\n\n[Next-generation video platform Verasity](https://verasity.io/) has developed a new system of media accountability and analytics called [Proof-of-View](https://verasity.io/documents/verasity_whitepaper_eng.pdf)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa patent-pending technology that uses 14 different methods to ensure each view recorded on the platform is a view from a genuine user. The data is captured and published in the public domain on the blockchain whilst ensuring personal information remains anonymized.\n\n**Clearly the market is ripe for the kinds of services that companies like Verasity are promising**. In less than two years since its founding, Verasity has already struck several partnerships with blockchain media agencies such as XCHNG and TRUTH Agency to provide brands with a new end-to-end media buying process and auditable way to ensure media efficiency. Individual video content providers can avail of VERA, Verasity‚Äôs forthcoming cryptocurrency that integrates a digital wallet functionality into the online player.\n\nPlatform users earn currency by watching content and can earn additional funds by opting in to watch ads. Users received immediate payment in reward for engaging with the brand, rather than having to wait some two or three months, as is the case on other similar platforms. The user can then choose to use earned VERA currency to pay content owners directly through the wallet. **The minimal transactional fees involved mean using a cryptocurrency for payments also effectively enables microtransactions on content that would not be commercially viable with fiat money.**\n\nConsidering that some of the largest video platforms like YouTube are known to take as much as 45% of advertising revenue, blockchain-based payment systems such as Verasity make financial sense for large-scale content providers as well.\n\nIn its roughly 20 years of existence, digital media has endured its share of growing pains as it seeks to maintain its authenticity and viability as a money-generating business. While faces of this technology are in its most nascent stages, blockchain-based systems may very well be the next step in taking the media industry into its next phase‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor at least be what powers digital media into its third decade.\n\n#### If you enjoyed this post, please subscribe and click the clap üëè button below to show your support!¬†‚¨á‚¨á\n\nWebsite: [https://verasity.io](https://verasity.io/)  \nTelegram: [http://t.me/verasitychat](http://t.me/verasitychat)  \nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/verasitytech](https://twitter.com/verasitytech)  \nFacebook: [https://facebook.com/verasitytech](https://facebook.com/verasitytech)  \nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/verasity](https://www.linkedin.com/company/verasity)  \nReddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/verasity](https://www.reddit.com/r/verasity)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/iywyed/how_blockchain_can_improve_new_media/,1,0

iyy08i,1600956787,Nyan.finance: The Digital Hedge Fund," A quick TL;DR breakdown of the project:\n\nName: Nyan $NYAN ‚Äã \n\nSupply: 33,000 ‚Äã \n\nStaked: 29,000+ ‚Äã \n\nSummary: Aims to be the first decentralized digital hedge fund. Its tokenomic structure allows individual users to invest pooled staking rewards collectively to build and increase the funds size like a traditionally managed private fund. This is accomplished using a governance voting system embedded in the contracts code. ‚Äã \n\nWebsite: [Nyan.finance](https://Nyan.finance)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDeFi is creating a blockchain environment like never before. New tokens are deployed everyday on the Ethereum chain, most of which aim for a quick 30x or more with gimmicky concepts, get-rich-quick schemes and downright copy/pasting past successful ideas. This has caused record breaking transactions on the Ethereum network, which are also due in part to the recent UNI airdrop. With that being said, not all of these new tokens are a waste of time. Innovation always finds its way, this time in the form of [*Nyan.Finance*](https://Nyan.Finance).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/njkgne7ss3p51.png?width=305&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83e46269b6ee52adedd7ef00b95711cfe737f03e\n\n*Nyan.finance* ***(NYAN)*** is a new ERC20 token which bills itself as ""*a DeFi governance token that turns individual traders into a collective whale.* ***NYAN*** *holders can stake their* ***NYAN*** *and receive a secondary token known as Catnip. When a user claims their accumulated rewards, they will only receive 80% of the reward. The other 20% is sent to be stored by the* ***NYAN*** *address in order to be used as part of the pumping mechanism.* ***NYAN*** *holders will be able to bid on a Uniswap token that they want to purchase with the funds in one, or a series of, large buys.*""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***NYAN*** has a total of 33,000 tokens for a total supply. The token can be broken down to 18 decimals. **It did not have a private or presale**, so tokens were made readily available for distribution after contract launch. 1,000 ***NYAN*** were distributed to the development team, with 2,000 also released as giveaway rewards. Liquidity is also locked for holders to trade on *Uniswap*. Currently, ***1 NYAN = $204.54 (0.595424 Eth)*** at the time of this writing, with a fully diluted market cap of ***$6,749,820***. As mentioned above, *Catnip* is also part of the ***NYAN*** tokenomic system, along with a third token named **DarkNyan**. All three tokens work hand in hand, and each asset will be outlined in full detail to explain how each attributes itself to the growth of the overall ***NYAN*** ecosystem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssentially, ***NYAN*** aims to provide a decentralized, community governed hedge fund, giving the holders of ***NYAN*** token the rights to decide collectively what they will invest in and for how long. Being decentralized, this gives community members an awesome responsibility, one that most other private hedge-funds or other iterations of a hedge-fund fail to offer. As mentioned earlier, a user who owns ***NYAN*** has the option to stake their ***NYAN*** to receive the secondary token *Catnip (NIP) (Contract Address: 0xD2B93f66FD68c5572BFB8EBf45E2Bd7968B38113)*. *NIP* currently has 28,440 tokens in circulation, with the supply growing as more *NIP* are minted via the staking of ***NYAN***. ***The current staking reward is: Blocks x NYAN staked / 100,000.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/28zbpi0ys3p51.jpg?width=1079&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1356fabb8ed527025e0f1006da47aae225d298ca\n\n*NIP* is the token given to holders who stake ***NYAN***. When a holder wants to claim their NIP staking rewards, users only receive 80% of that reward, with 20% of it being sent to the ***NYAN*** contract. The 20% of the ***NYAN*** staking rewards, which are now *NIP* held by the ***NYAN*** contract, are then pooled together and invested by the community via a voting system. In other words, voters create *NIP* via staking, the staking reward is then partially contributed to the decentralized ecosystem to create a hedge-fund made up of the combined contribution from stakers, with full control assessed to the community. *NIP* does have further utility, which will be explained below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlong with ***NYAN*** and *NIP*, there a third asset which plays a large part in this ecosystem called **Dark Nyan (DNYAN)** *(Contract Address: 0x23b7f3a35bda036e3b59a945e441e041e6b11101)*. **DNYAN** is attained joining the *NIP/ETH* liquidity pool on Uniswap. **DNYAN** currently has a supply of 554.14 tokens, and has its own major impact in regards to tokenomics. ***The current staking reward is:*** ***NIP/ETH*** ***LP (UNI-V2) Token x 6500/ 3,600,000 = DNYAN per day***. (*It is recommended to claim mined* ***DNYAN*** *as often as possible as difficulty increases*)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5a11t2fvs3p51.jpg?width=1060&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a367f269396b180d1b52acb47e3fa5e66991a35a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you have joined this pool and you receive the LP tokens, you navigate back to ***Nyan.finance*** to stake the LP token. Staking effectively allows the user to mine the **DNYAN** token, which has its own utility as well. The **DNYAN** token will allow ***NYAN*** voters, via an upcoming integration with *Polkadot*, to acquire non ERC20 assets. This effectively ensures that ***NYAN*** voters will have access to a vast collection of available cryptocurrency assets (while *Polkadot* does not support *ALL* cryptocurrency assets at this time, it is its goal and mission to support the vast majority of projects, which will effectively allow the ***NYAN*** token ecosystem full access to hedge against the assets there).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**To break down how the voting system will work, along with other questions the development team wanted to address if they ever arose, here is a bit of detail straight from the projects website:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Welcome to the steering wheel of a multi-million dollar machine***\n\n*In this system, Nyan holders will be able to freely govern the protocol as they wish. The voting and function calls operate on a bidding system, in which the bid with the most votes at the end of a round will be executed. A bid can be a call to a contract, or a combination of calls to one or multiple contracts, all within the same transaction.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***What are Bids?***\n\n*Glad you asked! Bids are a set of instructions that relay what functions to call with the Voting Connector contract. A bid is composed of the Bidder's address, a unique bidId, and a series of arrays with types including Integers, Strings, and Bytes. With these data fields, anyone will be able to construct a bid with its own set of parameters for the function to be called.*\n\n*Additionally, bids can be chained. No, this isn't street fighter. An additional bid can be chained to an initial bid. This additional bid is known as a chain bid. A chain bid requires an initial bid in order to be created. With chains, much more complex transactions can be created. It's a Pandora's box to be honest.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***How does voting occur?***\n\n*Voting for bids occurs within periods known as voting rounds. Before each round begins, Nyan holders can construct a bid and propose it in order to have it ready for voting. Other Nyan holders will vote using Nyan as a proof of collateral and Catnip as a fee. These fees will vary based on the amount of votes an individual is attempting to place in any one round. The more votes, the higher the Catnip cost. With this route, the cost of voting should be negligible for smaller holder. The current minimum Nyan needed to vote is 1 Nyan. However, this can be changed by voters.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***How does the machine maintain value?***\n\n*An reasonable thought that any onlooker would immediately have is: Is the protocol dependent on turning a profit? Fortunately, the answer is no. The Nyan machine will never have to turn a single profit in order to maintain value for Nyan holders. Here's why. All the funds held by the funding contract were generated by Nyan holders that have either staked their Nyan or Catnip Liquidity tokens. This means that those funds can be considered as speculated into existence. Now in order to make sure that value will always outpace minting and speculation, the goal of the Nyan protocol is continuously burn Catnip used as a fee for voting. Half of this Catnip will also be swapped for dNyan in order to provide rewards for individuals that provide liquidity to Nyan.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***How do distributions work?***\n\n*Voters decide when and what to distribute, with certain limitations. Distributions can be called once every 2 days maximum. The distribution can be for any token held by the funding address. Catnip and dNyan distributions are limited to 10% of their available amount in any one transaction. Distributions of other assets can use all of the available asset. In order to claim their proportion of the distributed asset, claimers must stake their Nyan or Catnip Liquidity tokens. The tokens will only be released when the distribution period has ended. This is to prevent users from unfairly claiming twice*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Is the voting contract fool-proof?***\n\n*No contract is fool-proof. The Nyan voting contracts, however are built with modularity in mind. Each contract can be upgraded, replaced and reconnected. Voters will only have to vote for a bid that reconnects the contract to the rest of the ecosystem. Built this way, Nyan can continuously be updated by it's community without the need for a central developer. The voters can also vote for a transfer that pays an external auditor to look over any code in the ecosystem. To get a better technical look at the upcoming voting contracts, visit the* *Nyan Github* *and look over the voting contract files. The files in the github are not the most current version, please do not fork them into production. There are several bugs and mistakes that have been done in the unpushed version.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI find the decentralized aspect of ***NYAN*** very appealing. It is a way for users to take control as a collective whale and make decisions with their vote. I have not seen any sort of ecosystem like this in the cryptocurrency space, and I am curious to see it explored and expanded, as the environment surrounding ***NYAN*** allows for contract upgrades and new integrations based on the voting system. With DeFi continuing to be a driving force in the recent surge in crypto related assets, can ***NYAN*** become a mainstay and solidify itself as the first truly decentralized hedge-fund? The playing field is set for it to do just that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚Äã Here are some things to expect in the near future along with other important facts:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Contract audit incoming\n* Investment voting launching this week\n* Liquidity locked\n* Dev has 1000 tokens, all of which are staked\n* 89% of tokens are staked\n* 200 tokens were each given to 5 people to encourage liquidity early on\n* 10 tokens were each given to the first 100 people to join telegram\n* Community-driven logo contest: [https://t.me/nyanpoll](https://t.me/nyanpoll)\n* Website upgrade this week, driven by a volunteer dev\n* Learnnnyan, a learning portal being created by the community\n* Beware clones that are being created, such as Kush\n* NYAN staking this week\n* Polkadot integration scheduled for end of month\n* v2 and secret contracts to prevent frontrunning planned\n* Both NYAN stakers and NIP liquidity providers get a share of profits\n* Likely looking to invest in safer platforms like Yearn and Curve initially\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*(I write articles and reviews for legitimate, interesting, up and coming cryptocurrency projects.

izlmqu,1601048014,How to Choose a Mining Pool?,"So you‚Äôre still not mining and don't know where to start? Or you‚Äôre already mining but want more? Choose the best mining pool! We‚Äôll tell you what to look for.\n\n**Reward System**\n\nIt‚Äôs better to look at how lucky the pool is (if we are talking about PPLNS) or at the logic of the reward calculation (if it is PPS+, as that‚Äôs exactly how this ‚Äú+‚Äù is calculated).\n\n**Hashrate, Uncles, Rejects**\n\nAll these values ‚Äã‚Äãmatter if you mine on PPLNS or PPS+, where the reward is calculated based on the block found by the pool. Each pool has its own statistics and its own reward calculation system. At CoinFly Pool, we calculate the reward according to the average daily value, thereby removing the risks associated with the pool's success from the users.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mf5zyz7cbp51.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfc8a46034f8be251831e50fd86a7b2eb53e56c8\n\n**Where the Servers Are Located**\n\nIn theory, the same equipment, launched at the same time on different pools, will mine a different amount, also because the server was closer to one of the pools. Therefore, it is ideal if the servers are located on the same continent as you.\n\n**Commission Fees**\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt seem bad if this value is 0. But it also happens that the pool makes such a good profit that there is enough for the 3% commission and for decent payouts to its miners.\n\n**Coins**\n\nIf it's not ETH or Ethereum Classic, then you can choose something specific. But you need to properly calculate whether you have enough power to mine that sh\*\*coin and also be quick to sell it at a good price. As one never knows what will happen to its rate tomorrow.\n\n**Dual mining**\n\nIt seems like an awesome idea: mine a few coins, collect them in both pockets. But then let‚Äôs take the Ezil.me pool for example. It offers dual mining with a 10% profit. We‚Äôve been watching it for a while and here‚Äôs the thing: even the +10% calculations on its calculator were less than ours on the [CoinFly pool](https://ethpool.coinfly.cc/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_content=medium).\n\nAuto-switching\n\nThe pool automatically switches your mining to a coin which is more profitable to mine at the moment. However, this is typically carried out without taking into account the specifics of the equipment, which is not good. Again, the profit of the Whalesburg pool, which offers auto-switching, is lower in comparison to CoinFly.\n\n**The place of the pool on Miningpoolstats**\n\nSometimes you can earn more on a small pool than on such giants as Ethermine. One of the crypto bloggers made a comparison on YouTube, where for example, Ethermine distributed 5% less than a small pool.\n\nAnd the bottom line: you have to try and compare. The pool that has transferred more coins to your wallet is surely the good one. And it doesn't matter what hashrate it has or with what type of magic their admin is practicing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/izlmqu/how_to_choose_a_mining_pool/,1,2
