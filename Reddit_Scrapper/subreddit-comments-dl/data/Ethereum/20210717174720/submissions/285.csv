kriusj,1609917395,"EIP1559, ETH 1.5 Sharding &amp; Berlin Hard Fork","Hey guys,\n\nRecently, since the release of the Beacon Chain I recall a post from Vitalik on twitter regarding the progress of the Ethereum network and the ongoing developments. With the successful release of the Beacon Chain coming on at the expected date where do we stand with the other following updates?\n\nI recall some articles stating the Berlin hard fork was pencilled in for January but I haven't seen anything as of yet or any updates since October 2020. Does anyone have any news on the network update?\n\nEIP1559 I know is still not ready and I am releastically expecting it's change roughly 2021 Q3 unless anyone has anything more specific?\n\nFinally with both Berlin and EIP1559 currently progressing does everything think that this year will Ethereum also go through the 1.5 Sharding changes? I just feel that while the team has done an amazing job with the Beacon Chain they aren't always the most reliable when it comes to how long things are taking/progressing (""soon""). \n\nLike most of you id rather it done right then rushed but at the same time do you think the timeline for all of this is achievable in 2021 and when do you think will be the rough release dates.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kriusj/eip1559_eth_15_sharding_berlin_hard_fork/,1,10

krp8ay,1609944441,I am a digital artist about to start selling my work as NFTs on Rarible. Could someone with experience on the platform help advise me with what art to use/general advice?,"Hi all,\n\nI am a digital artist that actually used to be a part of a big digital art scene back in 2008-2012 where I was a member of two art collectives - [Evokeone](http://www.evokeone.com/) &amp; [Slashthree](http://www.slashthree.com/). With the growing of social media, these online art collectives became a thing of the past. Which is really sad, because I met some amazing artists who I still talk to today. However, seeing websites such as Rarible, SuperRare, Nifty Gateway, Makers Place, etc pop up I think this is a really cool resurgence of digital art in a new way that wasn't possible ten years ago, and I want to be a part of it again. \n\nI never really stopped making digital art in my spare time off of work, so this is where I was hoping I could use your expertise. I applied to SuperRare and Nifty Gateway, but I haven't heard back yet so I decided that I am going to upload a few pieces to Rarible. I have a few different styles where I work in -\n\nHere is a link to my matte paintings [Matte Paintings](https://www.behance.net/gallery/73911401/Photomanipulations-Matte-Paintings-2016-2018), would these sell on this platform? I have a small following on social media, so I would obviously push them out there too (not sure how much my followers are into crypto though). Or would I be better off selling these hip hop portraits that I do on my Instagram - [@brandonspahnart](https://www.instagram.com/brandonspahnart/). These are my original digital paintings, but am I even allowed to sell them due to using pop culture? Or does that even matter? Final question about selling - if I was to animate my matte paintings, would that have a higher chance? Does animation do better than static images?\n\nI am currently waiting on one more day for my $100 transfer from my bank account to Coinbase to go through. I set up a wallet through Fortmatic. How much do gas runs usually cost to upload to Rarible? Like 15-20 a piece? I kind of want to do this just for the fun and excitement of it. I also don't want to do this only for the money - I think this is a cool opportunity for people to see my digital art and to have a resurgence of it. But I don't want to rip through a couple hundred dollars really quick without planning ahead of time.\n\nAnyways I appreciate you taking the time to read this! I'm hoping to get some discussion going where this might help people through a google search in the future too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/krp8ay/i_am_a_digital_artist_about_to_start_selling_my/,1,47
