gk6g5g,1589537588,v7.0.0 Pre-Berlin HF Release for Ethereum Consensus Tests,"Hi everyone,  \nthis is a last stable [v7.0.0](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases/tag/v7.0.0) release for the Ethereum cross-client Consensus tests. This can be used by client developers to have a reference point to update test runners against before Berlin HF PRs (like [https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/685](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/685) for [EIP-2315](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2315) EVM subroutine support) get merged in.\n\nThis release will be followed up by one or more `v8.0.0-beta.x` releases with subsequently added Berlin HF tests until we reach a new stable ground here. It is of course still up to you and possible to use your own `ethereum/tests` snapshot from the latest `develop` branch state. This is just an additional offer which can e.g. serve as a reference point to compare client test runs against each other and identify bugs or inconsistencies.\n\nPlease have a closer look at the release notes - especially the ""Test Format Changes"" section - since there are significant changes since the last [v7.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.1) release. I would also advice to have a closer look at the number of tests run, since structural repo updates like changes in the folder structure might lead to some tests to be forgotten and went through unnoticed.\n\nThere are also several new test cases added along the way, which might trigger some failures on your test runs due to newly added edge cases.\n\nAll credits for the great work done here belong to [@winsvega](https://github.com/winsvega) together with contributions from [@shemnon](https://github.com/shemnon), [@spetz](https://github.com/spetz), [@holiman](https://github.com/holiman), [@gumb0](https://github.com/gumb0) and [@MrChico](https://github.com/MrChico).\n\nIf you are integrating the `ethereum/tests` library as a submodule here are some basic installation notes to upgrade your submodule to the latest release tag:\n\n    cd [SUBMODULE_FOLDER]\n    git fetch --tags origin develop\n    git tag -l\n    git checkout tags/[RELEASE_VERSION]\n    cd ..\n    git add [SUBMODULE_FOLDER]\n    git commit -m ""[MESSAGE_ON_TEST_RELEASE_UPDATE]""\n\nSee [release notes](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases/tag/v7.0.0) linked or below for a full list of changes:\n\nThis is the last `Ethereum` tests release with a pre-`Berlin` HF state, so it provides some stable ground to upgrade client test runners against to be ready for a `Berlin` hardfork integration.\n\n## Tests Added\n\n## StateTests / BlockchainTests\n\n## EIP-2200\n\nAdded state tests (also as `BlockchainTests`) to validate the EIP-1706/[EIP-2200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200) out of gas condition, specifically aimed at validating less than or equals to the stipend handling, see `GeneralStateTests/stSStoreTest/sstore_gasLeft.json`, PR [\#649](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/649)\n\n## DIV/SDIV/MOD/SDIV by Zero\n\nAdded state tests (also as `BlockchainTests`) checking DIV/SDIV/MOD/SDIV by zero, see `GeneralStateTests/stSolidityTest/ByZero.json`, PR [\#647](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/647)\n\n## Stack Validity of SWAP\n\nAdded tests checking stack validity of SWAP, see `GeneralStateTests/stStackTests/stackOverflowSWAP.json` and `[..]/stacksanitySWAP.json`, PR [\#647](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/647)\n\n## EXTCODEHASH Empty Account\n\nAdded more EXTCODEHASH state tests (also as `BlockchainTests`) of nonexistent and post suicide accounts, see `GeneralStateTests/stExtCodeHash/callToNonExistent.json`, `[..]/callToSuicideThenExtcodehash.json` and `[..]/createEmptyThenExtcodehash.json`, PR [\#654](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/654)\n\n## SELFBALANCE in different Call Types\n\nAdded a composite state test (also in `BlockchainTests`) for SELFBALANCE that will do all the exisitng test inside of CALL, DELEGATECALL, and CALLCODE calls, see `GeneralStateTests/stSelfBalance/selfBalanceCallTypes.json`, PR [\#671](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/671)\n\n## Retesteth Unit Tests\n\nIntroduced retesteth unitTests in `BlockchainTests/InvalidBlocks/bcExpectSection/filling_unexpectedAccount.json`, PR [\#676](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/676)\n\n## Difficulty Tests\n\nAdded difficulty tests for [EIP-2384](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2384) (Muir Glacier Difficulty Bomb Delay), PR [\#662](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/662)\n\n## Keystore Tests\n\nAdded KeyStore test based on MyCrypto file in order to ensure that the generated file is compatible with MyCrypto and Metamask, PR [\#665](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/665)\n\n## RLP Tests\n\nAdded RLP invalid tests for insufficient bytes, see `RLPTests/invalidRLPTest.json`, PR [\#614](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/614)\n\n## Test Format Changes\n\n## BlockChainTests\n\n## LegacyTests\n\n`BlockChain` tests up to `ConstantinopleFix` (aka `Petersburg`) now also have been moved to the \[LegacyTests/\] folder, the main test folders on this release only contain the `Istanbul` tests, PR [\#648](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/648)\n\n## VMTests -&gt; BlockchainTests\n\n`VMTests` have been converted to `BlockchainTests` and can now be found in `BlockchainTests/ValidBlocks/VMTests/`, PR [\#680](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/680)\n\n## PostState Correction\n\nOn some LegacyTests `postState` has been corrected to `postStateHash`, you can use this [repo search](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/search?q=postStateHash&amp;unscoped_q=postStateHash) to see which tests are affected. This might need some adoption of your test runner.\n\n## InvalidBlockChain Tests: Expected Block Exceptions\n\nMajor blockchain test refactoring, and regeneration on geth + retesteth, see [files diff](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/672/files) for an impression on the format changes (`InvalidBlockchainTests`). PR [\#672](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/672)\n\n## Retesteth\n\n* Add Transition genesis retesteth configurations to default geth configs, PR [\#646](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/646)\n* Updated default mining reward config for transition nets in retesteth configs to avoid retesteth error when filling the state tests, PR [\#650](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/650)\n* Use additional forks in retesteth configs. Additional forks used in `TransitionTests` and not automatically used in StateTests/BlockchainTests, PR [\#651](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/651)\n* Enable Istanbul in aleth's retesteth configs, PR [\#656](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/656)\n* Fix ripemd160 precompile name in retesteth configs, PR [\#659](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/659)\n* Fix ECADD and ECMUL precompiles in Istanbul retesteth config, PR [\#660](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/660)\n* Add `ChainID` to Istanbul retesteth config, PR [\#661](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/661)\n* Remove retesteth configs, configs are now stored in retesteth repo. PR [\#666](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/666)\n\n## Test Fixes\n\n* Reduce 50k bytes code in quadratic complexity tests to 20k bytes. Resolves issue [https://github.com/ethereum/tests/issues/657](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/issues/657), see `GeneralStateTests/stQuadraticComplexityTest/Call[*]KbytesContract[*].json`, PR [\#658](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/658) and PR [\#669](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/669)\n* Minor changes to the test filler format around field strictness, affected tests `BlockchainTests/InvalidBlocks/bcExpectSection/filling_wrongStorage2.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stExtCodeHash/*`, `GeneralStateTests/stRandom/` (3), `GeneralStateTests/stReturnDataTest/subcallReturnMoreThenExpected.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stStaticCall/static_call_value_inherit.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stTransactionTest/Opcodes_TransactionInit.json`, PR [\#677](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/677)\n* Upgrade and regenerate invalid RLP blockchain tests, PR [\#673](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/673)\n* Fix test fillers affected by the CompareStates bug, affected tests `BlockchainTests/ValidBlocks/bcStateTests/randomStatetest377.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stCallCreateCallCodeTest/Call1024PreCalls.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stChangedEIP150/Call1024PreCalls.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stCreate2/create2checkFieldsInInitcode.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stDelegatecallTestHomestead/Call1024PreCalls.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stRandom/randomStatetest349.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stRandom2/randomStatetest578.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stRefundTest/*`, `GeneralStateTests/stStaticCall/*`, PR [\#678](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/678)\n* Fixed blockgaslimit in CALLBlake2f\_MaxRouds, see `GeneralStateTests/stTimeConsuming/CALLBlake2f_MaxRounds.json`, PR [\#679](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/679)\n* Removed `bcExpectSection` in `BlockchainTests` from public tests, PR [\#684](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/684)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/gk6g5g/v700_preberlin_hf_release_for_ethereum_consensus/,1,0
