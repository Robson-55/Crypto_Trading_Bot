li16t2,1613095946,Building a ETH based lottery - looking for feedback,"Working on a provably fair lottery for ETH with no house edge, and I wanted some feedback on a few parameters. Generally speaking, anyone is allowed to make a new lottery (raffle?) with a fixed number of tickets with a price more than the minimum bet. Aside from fees needed to pay for the random() generation in an outside contract (provable / oraclize) all winnings minus a small fee will be sent to the winner of the round. The round closes as soon as the last ticket is sold.   \n\n\nWhat I am looking for are ideas on:  \n1. Should the bet size be fixed (say 0.1 eth)? Or, should it be configurable by the creator with a minimum?  \n2. What is a fair house fee for the contract? I will be looking to be able to recoup the deployment costs as well as the hosting costs given I hodl more solidity code than eth lol.  \n3. Would you play?   \n\n\nAppreciate your thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/li16t2/building_a_eth_based_lottery_looking_for_feedback/,1,7

Invest in ETH or MINE,First of all let me say I‚Äôm relatively new to the crypto community and I‚Äôm fascinated by the technology in and of itself.(which is why I‚Äôm posting here rather than eth mining or eth finance) I‚Äôve been immersing myself in all things blockchain and as someone that works in technology I‚Äôm just surprised I dismissed it for so long. Let me be clear I‚Äôm investing because I believe in the technology and it‚Äôs potential to shape the future.\n\nI started investing in ETH about a month ago and since then I‚Äôve acquired 3 ETH and set up a mining rig consisting of my personal 3080 and my old 2080ti. Which at current conditions nets me an estimated 0.30 ETH a month.\n\nI want to invest more in etherium but i‚Äôm torn between investing and mining. Keep in mind that I‚Äôm looking to hold my ETH for at least 3-5 years. Some friendly advice about where it‚Äôs headed would be greatly appreciated.

The burn seems intended to deflate/inflate ETH to match transactional demand.
