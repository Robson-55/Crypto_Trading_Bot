I like you all and respect the work that has been done to make ethereum the best blockchain platform. My question is if coins like ADA, NEO, EOS have the technology to drastically lower fees/ times and they have had that technology for a year or two, I believe. Why wasn't ETH 2.0 implemented earlier to avoid the problem of network congestion?
