o1ales,1623865200,NFT + Drugs + Farming = Crypto Junkies," If you like some of the concept above, keep reading…\n\nHi everyone, too much noise about NFT in the past months, so why not add some funny items to the mix. A group of friends and I are creating this new game concept, when you will have your CJ (Crypto Junkie avatar/character) and must consume drugs in forms of farmable tokens in order to not die and survive through the season. Becoming your CJ more valuable than the others that passed away (Deleted).\n\nThe reason that I writing this is because we need clever and active people, no matter your skills or experience; we need participative people, involved and commitment with the project.  \n\nWe don’t have plans to monetize as of yet, this is only for the experience and fun, this is an opportunity to become part of a team with other developers, financials and game-theorists people, to complete an heterogeneous group and putting your name in a big and remarkable game.\n\nSome the drugs, seasons features, CJ interactions in-game and other mechanics stuff still need to be fine-tuned out in a test environment. \n\nBe part at this early stage, build an ambitious NFT game with Us and let fly high together, PM are available or just post your ideas below, ask anything I’m happy to answer you thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o1ales/nft_drugs_farming_crypto_junkies/,0,0
