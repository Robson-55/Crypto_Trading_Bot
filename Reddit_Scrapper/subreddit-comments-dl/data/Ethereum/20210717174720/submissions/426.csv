lsq41p,1614314658,How to sell art through NFTs?,"I've been watching the NFT space from afar for about a year now and I have been a longtime holder of ETH. However, from my understanding, every single NFT space so far operates like an exclusive gallery with preselected images by just a few artists. I love some of the art there and I am super happy for those artists, but I myself of course have nothing for sale on any website. I know a ton of other artists who want to get involved in the space and don't know how, but I think at the end of the day we're all tired of giving a 50% cut to every gallery, stock website, or image broker. Is there currently a place where I could make this happen? Sorry if this question comes off as dumb, I know you guys are very serious about ETH here and I feel like this should be a pretty obvious question, but I really haven't figured it out. If I'm being honest, my pea brain can only really comprehend that Ethereum is better than other cryptos and has a ton of awesome functions, but I couldn't begin to tell you how a lot of them work.
