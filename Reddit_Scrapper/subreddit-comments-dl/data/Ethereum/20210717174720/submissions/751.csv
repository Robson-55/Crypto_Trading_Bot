My application relies on processing pending transactions for the mempool and acting on them, so speed is paramount.\n\nI have never run a full node myself, only used wss from third party providers such as quicknode.\n\nI am trying to decide between hosting the node in the cloud vs hosting it locally on a machine in my home. I have a good internet speed (300 MB/s) but obviously nothing compared to the speeds and latency you could get on a datacenter.\n\nWould the inferior connection in my home be a bottleneck in this case?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nt0l8k/running_a_full_node_locally/,1,8
