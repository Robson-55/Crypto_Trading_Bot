n543z7,1620178704,Staking,Hello and thank you in advance. I just started my crypto investments last week. I have spent countless hours research the various coins and technology but now am unsure what to do. I currently own half of an ETH coin with plans to continue to purchase more over the years. Is it worth staking half a coin right now? Or should I wait until I accumulate more? Should I not stake at all? I do plan on holding my ETH for the long term. Any advice would be appreciated.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n543z7/staking/,1,14

n54wzm,1620181218,Exchange Question,"I currently have ether on coinbase, but I am wondering if you have other recommendations for where to buy and I'm feeling about overwhelmed with the options. I am not well versed in crypto and currently working to improve that, stocks and indexs are my thing.  After my research it seems like binance is one of the better for fees. I'm a bit torn on shakepay and their margins approach.     \n    \nI will be buying more in monthly increments around $200-250 and holding and I want to store on a hard wallet now. I'm hoping you could share your opinion on the following:.   \n    \n1) My understand is after purchasing ether a platform and I transfer it to my hardwallet, will I incur fees on that transfer? Or only when I sell?     \n2) Is binance the best/ cheapest option?   \nTIA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n54wzm/exchange_question/,1,4
