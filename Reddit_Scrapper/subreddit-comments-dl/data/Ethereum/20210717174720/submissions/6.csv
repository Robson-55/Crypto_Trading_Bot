gn90rk,1589970940,Physical simulations on a blockchain,"Hello, I recently published a peer-reviewed research article in the UK's Royal Society of Chemistry flagship journal, Chemical Science, Titled: ""Computational chemistry experiments performed directly on a blockchain virtual computer"".\n\nThis work was done on the Ethereum blockchain, so I thought that this might be of interest to some of you here. The article details the first instance of a computational physics simulation being performed entirely within a blockchain virtual machine. In this case the experiment was a proof-of-principle study using a simple harmonic potential to model the trajectory of a vibrating carbon monoxide molecule. I have also discussed the potential benefits of this type of calculation in terms of censorship resistance, reproducibility, and provenance in theoretical scientific work.\n\nArticle: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340820303\_Computational\_chemistry\_experiments\_performed\_directly\_on\_a\_blockchain\_virtual\_computer](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340820303_Computational_chemistry_experiments_performed_directly_on_a_blockchain_virtual_computer)  \nAnd: [https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2020/sc/d0sc01523g](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2020/sc/d0sc01523g)\n\nLinks are also on my Twitter: [u/MagnusWDHH](https://www.reddit.com/u/MagnusWDHH/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/gn90rk/physical_simulations_on_a_blockchain/,1,1
