I'm trying to transfer it out. MEW doesn't show any balance on the initial page but I see the balance on Etherscan/ethplorer.\n\nWhen I click to transfer out the balance and select send all, nothing changes, and when I manually type it in and hit send, nothing happens. \n\nAnybody know how to fix this?

mlq5lp,1617755948,Help Pls?,\nI seriously need help as I‚Äôm in a bit of a crypto hell currently. I‚Äôm an American and I have $164 of a useless currency called USD Digital trapped on a useless (for Americans) website called blockchain.com. They say I need ETH in order to swap my useless USDD to Bitcoin which I need to do in order to send it to cashapp and finally to my bank. \n\nBUT they won‚Äôt let Americans buy or sell crypto there. Only trade and receive. So they told me I need to send in ETH from somewhere else and assured me that I only need $5 worth to function as ‚Äúgas‚Äù for my purpose. So I made an account on Binance.US and bought $20 of ETH (the minimum allowed) and tried to send it to my wallet on blockchain.com. \n\nNOPE Binance.US says you need to have at least 0.02 of ETH to do that üôÉ jfc on the cross how can I get my $164 out of that hellsite without spending additional $100‚Äôs? \n\nPS. I cannot use Coinbase,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mlq5lp/help_pls/,1,7
mlq63n,1617755997,"Major De-Fi Projects Guide | Useful for New-to-DeFi Folks | De-Di Deep Dive, Part V","Hey everyone - I haven't posted all of this article series over here because previous articles have been more general re: crypto. This week, though, I did a survey of a wide range of De-Fi projects that I find interesting, as well as providing a brief overview for new folks of the various different components (market makers, wallets, exchanges, etc.) that manage the flow of crypto. There are a ton of new entrants in the De-Fi space - *the majority, although not all, are ERC-20 tokens* \- and I thought this would be a nice one-stop-shop for a lot of the major projects out there - from prediction markets, to machine learning, to blockchain and IRL identity management, to projects focused on the helping creators monetize or connecting NFTs to real-life stuff. \n\n**Without further ado, here's the link**: [https://practicalprogressive.substack.com/p/de-fi-deep-dive-part-v](https://practicalprogressive.substack.com/p/de-fi-deep-dive-part-v) \n\nFeel free to leave a comment here or on the article if there's an interesting project that I've forgotten! This obviously isn't comprehensive, and I've tried to limit the article to blockchains focused on specific service development or on solving a cross-blockchain problem, rather than surveying the various alt-coins (I address some of the alt-coin tech [in Part III)](https://practicalprogressive.substack.com/p/de-fi-deep-dive-part-iii).",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mlq63n/major_defi_projects_guide_useful_for_newtodefi/,1,0
