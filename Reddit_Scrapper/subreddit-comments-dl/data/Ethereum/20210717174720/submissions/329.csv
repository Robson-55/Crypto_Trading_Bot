l57ml5,1611640808,Anyone willing to try an ETH game?,"A friend of mine from [Finite Games](https://www.finite.games/) has developed a blockchain game built on Solidity. It’s called RoShamBo \[[trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWGo3Ac3z_c&amp;feature=emb_title)\] - a combination of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors and trading cards. Fortunately, they’re now on Alpha and they’re seeking for some Alpha testers. Here are some details:\n\nMechanics:\n\n* There are a limited number of rocks, papers, and collectible cards. They have various levels of durability — with single-use being the most common.\n* The goal is to collect the most stars by defeating opponents\n* Cards and stars can be traded\n* In-game wagering with your stars, cards and digital assets are allowed\n* The time period for a season is limited\n\nThey’re still developing the game to conduct tournaments in the future. Coming soon to Ethereum Network's Solidity, Tron Network, iOS, Android, and Samsung App Store. You can register for the Alpha [**here**](https://games.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=d994f9e9b3cc039e029f2ef5d&amp;id=b5adff994e).
