l4b7m5,1611533140,Question from a noob / beginner,"So, I have a home/gaming computer with a 3090 and hi-efficiency PSU that doesn't get used for 3/4 of the day, and power is pretty cheap in Vancouver so I thought I would try and understand what mining is all about.\n\nStarting with Ethereum (need to start somewhere), and getting about 110mh/s out of the box, I was wondering if people could provide context if/what/why it might make sense for me to do this, or does it make more sense to take a gamble on a crypto that is still in the pennies (or something really low) so if there is a chance that it explodes, you might make a bit of money?\n\nI realize that I only have one rig and this is recreational for me - does it make sense to keep my rig grinding away in the background. Right now with the watercooling and not excessive o/c'ing the rig the GPU hovers around 40-45c so I am not creating an excessive amount of heat (might be a bit of an issue once summer comes a long).\n\nSo its really about the question from a recreational strategy - should I just try and mine a specific coin, should I use NiceHash (and as i understand it, basically rent out my GPU for the best profit at the time based on what NiceHash calculates), should I pick a rando relatively unknown and new coin just for shoots and giggles?\n\nAll in all, this is a fun learning experience so am thankful for any constructive insight, feedback, suggestions etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l4b7m5/question_from_a_noob_beginner/,1,1
l4b9jc,1611533309,Ethereum valuation models,"Hi all and happy Sunday. I've been reading and learning more about some of the Bitcoin valuation models like Stock-to-Flow and the updated Stock-to-Flow X approaches. The conversation of their validity notwithstanding, are there any valuation models that have been done for Ethereum? Any that are promising?\n\nI saw this post:  [(1) I calculated Ethereum's Stock-to-Flow value : ethfinance (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gld5d5/i_calculated_ethereums_stocktoflow_value/)  as well as this one:  [Stock To Flow - Santiment Community Insights](https://insights.santiment.net/read/stock-to-flow-617). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre there any other models that are more pertinent to ETH? Could Stock-to-Flow even be as valid for Ethereum as it is for Bitcoin? What differences would there be between the model for ETH as well as for ETH 2.0 and other phases?\n\nAny guidance on where to start looking is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l4b9jc/ethereum_valuation_models/,1,0

I even get XRP and DOGE... but one thing that I do not get is governance tokens with hundreds of millions to billions of dollars of market cap.\n\nCould somebody please explain to me why somebody would want to trade their assets for governance tokens, or support selling/trading of governance tokens?\n\nI suppose you could buy up over 50% of the tokens and then vote to transfer all assets on the platform to your own personal wallet.\n\nOther than that, I just do not understand what other rationale there is for governance tokens, other than being issued in the first place to make their founders money by selling control of the project to the highest bidder.\n\nIt just seems risky/questionable to me to create tokens specifically for governance that require no financial interest on the platform itself and can allow entities with unknown and potentially nefarious intentions to assume control of the project.\n\nThe only way for a project to truly be decentralized would be to make the project immutable.

If the product isn't like advertised I can file a fraud claim and get my money back. \n\nObviously smart contracts are currently not enforcable legal documents, so what are possible solutions to create a safe exchange of assets/services? Also would we deal with a cancellation right or refund policy?\n\nIn the current system, ""trust"" is given by governments enforcing laws on these companies, and being able to freeze bank accounts, seize assets and fine or arrest individuals.
