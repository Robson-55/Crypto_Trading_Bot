nz5apj,1623616421,Ethereum will be obsolete,"Imagine a world where Ethereum didn't have first mover advantage. Imagine a world where projects like Algorand or Cardano did. Now ask yourself, if Ethereum followed Algorand or Cardano would it even stand a chance of adoption; the high fees, the tedious convoluted third party scaling solutions, etc. The answer is no. No one would even be talking about Ethereum because the tech is terrible. It's outdated. The only reason people are still talking about ETH is because of financial intuitions who have more money than sense backing Ethereum's dated technology.\n\nStop clinging to projects that you know are a convoluted mess of third party solutions used to prop up outdated technology. Yes, I know that you have a lot of money invested in ETH, yes, I know that you mine ETH and it pays the bills, good for you but don't pretend like Ethereum is the best blockchain tech on the market because you favor it like it's your child.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nz5apj/ethereum_will_be_obsolete/,0,29

How do you all feel about this? And what about the general implication that whatâ€™s good for Bitcoin is good for ethereum while whatâ€™s bad for Bitcoin is bad for ethereum?
