kt2mr1,1610113255,Where to find Ethereum jobs for eth pay,"It appears there is a massive migration to a Bitcoin + Ethereum economy.  \n\nAt the same time, I'm watching an absolutely devastating devaluation of a lifetime of savings, an untenable rapid increase in the cost of living, and wealth in the corporate world only goes to the top while our wages are stagnating.  \n\nOne way I see for the average person to keep up, maybe even get ahead, is to make money that makes money that can't be so easily devalued.  I also believe that Eth2 will open the floodgates, enable developers and consumers to establish new types of services and businesses, create transparent autonomous organizations, and fairer, encoded distributions of wealth that communities and organizations create.\n\nWhere can people find work, employment, that pays in eth?

I plan on storing it offline on a USB drive, but I'm not sure if I can only transfer after I stop mining or if I need the usb plugged in always, etc.\n\n3. Any useful tips that can help me?
