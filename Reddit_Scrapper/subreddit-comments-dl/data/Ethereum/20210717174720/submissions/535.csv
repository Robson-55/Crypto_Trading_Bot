mu9hri,1618863415,Make the case against ETH,"I'll preface this post with the caveat that I am extremely bullish on ETH, having held BTC/ETH since 2017 and still buying ETH as we speak.\n\nWith that said, I'm trying to educate myself more lately -- back when I first bought crypto, I didn't think much of it (used crypto more for gambling than anything else). It's my opinion that it would be best to understand both sides of the coin (no pun intended) rather than blindly worship any one coin in a maximalist fashion.\n\nCurious to hear people's best arguments as to why Ethereum could fail.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mu9hri/make_the_case_against_eth/,1,47
