I still think it is, but with the recents development I happened to realise I don‚Äôt know shit about eth and I can‚Äôt properly invest in something I don‚Äôt understand. Sorry for the long intro, all that to say I watched a video on Vitalik talking about eth and how an app like Kickstarter could easily be reproduced on the ethereum network. Now my question is, the whole point for the creators of Kickstarter is to get a commission on each campaign of crowdfunding, how would it be an advantage for them to make it a Dapp ? If someone were to do it, and make it so that no commission was taken with the Dapp Kickstarter contrary to the classical Kickstarter, offering the same service, wouldn‚Äôt it kill the company ? \nAlso I‚Äôm trying to understand what would be the point for a developer to create a Dapp if it means he lose all control over it ? \nThanks a lot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nezmii/question_about_desire_to_create_dapps/,1,5
