In other words, do rewards associated with your BETH ""follow"" you, or do you have to keep it in binance?\n\n(2) The article I linked to above mentions other ""ways to use BETH"", like providing liquidity for example.

Why is that?,"Same for Polkadot, and it's only a year old. Cardano does not seem to attract developers and projects. Why do you think this is?\n\nI've heard:\n1) The Haskell programming language is difficult to master or just very different than traditional programming languages.\n2) Eth and Dot gave a lot of funds away to projects building on their platforms, while Cardano focused on development and peer reviewed research implementation instead.\n3) Cardano does not have smart contracts yet while Eth and Dot (sort of) do. Cardano is incomplete to the point it's not worth it to build on it yet. \n4) Cardano doesn't sufficiently add any improvements over Eth or other smart contract coins. \n\n\nThis is what I've heard.

nswd1f,1622901627,Trying to understand Smart Contract Fees,"Hello everyone, I'm starting to use some DeFi applications more and more recently and it's being a great experience so far.\n\nAs a part of DeFi applications, you have to pay fees to use them all the time, and some of them I just don't understand. I will list my questions below with some examples\n\nYesterday I used [ALCX](https://app.alchemix.fi/) for some staking. At first, I had to ""approve ALCX spend limit"" on MetaMask and this transaction only costs me \n0.00065315600004 Ether ($1.72) as shown [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7f0e359709ce7352df6e63d21a6a25c93ca759a316e37f909d067cb66d9f3bd3). My question is, what is Spend Limit Approval, and why fees for it are so low in comparison with other Ethereum uses cases? Second, I could only actually use the staking protocol after this approval shown above, why is that? \n\nSo I paid this fee and actually got able to use the staking protocol, when the fees were considerably [higher](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa86b72ffff9e8a192dcf759978d0405cde0fbe4a7f7bc5cff87174513df33665). Why the fees for Smart Contracts are higher than a normal transaction? (this can also be seen on the [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) gas dashboard, where it shows that fees are higher for Uniswap Swap and Uniswap Add/Remove LP.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nswd1f/trying_to_understand_smart_contract_fees/,1,5

If blockchain based website take off in web 3.0 than no one will want to pay annual fees for having a domain.\n* They are an Ethereum NFT - which means they can be easily transferred between between wallets easily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly no one can predict what will work or not work in the future, but after missing out on a lot of Crypto I willing to part with a few buck just to try.
