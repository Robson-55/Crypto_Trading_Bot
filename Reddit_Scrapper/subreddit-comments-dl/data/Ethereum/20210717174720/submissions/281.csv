kqcp4j,1609779549,ANALYSISEthereum Price Analysis: 04 January,"Disclaimer: The findings of the following analysis are the sole opinions of the writer and should not be taken as investment advice\n\nEthereum surged from $715 to $1,169 in a span of three days. However, the $1,168 high was momentary and the price was soon forced to retrace as Ether formed a swing failure pattern. ETH is usually an indicator of the altcoin market‚Äôs health and its stupendous gains over the past 48 hours saw the market follow in its footsteps. In fact, Ethereum had a 0.25% funding rate on BitMEX, implying that the market was crowded with long positions.\n\nWhether the swing failure leads to cascading liquidated long positions, or whether the market finds support due to buying pressure stepping in, remains to be seen. Given the bullish nature of the market over recent weeks, it is likely that this is a dip and not a reversal for ETH.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kqcp4j/analysisethereum_price_analysis_04_january/,1,1

kqgge5,1609790247,Ethereum Gas,"First off, apologies if this is a noob question and I ought to know the answer, but here goes...\n\nI'm using Truffle/Ganache to create a basic smart contract to test an idea out. Looking at the logs and blocks got me wondering and I was struggling to find the answer to a couple of Qs...\n\n1) Where do the gas fees go? If I'm right in my understanding, Gas fees on the main Ethereum network will go to the miners/validators as their incentive. Where do these fees go on a network running in Ganache?\n\n2) Each transaction I'm creating is creating a new block (primarily send transactions). Again, it may be my lack of understanding, but I thought that blocks could contain multiple transactions. Is this because of my configuration in Ganache? Do I need to adjust the gas price and limit? I just have them at default currently.\n\nThanks in advance.

kqko6v,1609802149,Tether Price Manipulation,"Hello everyone,\n\nbefore you go ahead and read this, I need to mention that I'm a long term Ethereum HODLer and that I strongly believe in the notion of cryptocurrency. The intention of this post is not to spread conspiracy theories, rather, its purpose is to encourage a legitimate discussion on the topic.\n\nTether has been manipulating Bitcoin's price upwards for years now by printing unlimited, and unbacked USDT. This thread will cover the controversial aspects surrounding Tether, and how it will eventually meet its demise.\n\n**A bit of a back story:**  \nTether is a stable coin that was first launched in 2012. According to the company, Tether is backed 1:1 with the U.S dollar, although this isn't actually the case. Bitfinex, and Tether have refused to show audits of their reserves, which is held in offshore bank accounts.\n\nIn 2019, The United States District Court sued Bitfinex, Tether, and Poloniex for being involved in a massive price manipulation, and fraud scheme in the crypto markets.  In a court hearing, Tether's lawyer admitted the stable coin was only backed by 74% cash, and securities.\n\n**How the scam works:**  \nTether can print infinite amounts of (worthless) USDT.  They then inject this into BTC, ETH, LTC, (and others) to cause prices to pump. Notice how during the months they stopped printing Tether, the market moves sideways or drops significantly. Without USDT, Bitcoin wouldn't have reached 35K+\n\nThe majority of funds flowing into Bitcoin is from Tether.  When Tether ultimately meets its fate, the market will see a major correction as the lawsuit highlights how BTC isn't actually worth the insanely high prices you're seeing now.\n\nConsidering these bull runs are mostly caused by price manipulation, FOMO, and hype. The Bitcoin bubble could pop, and see large amounts of its market cap disappear in the months following Tether's demise.\n\nAs the lawsuit comes closer, Tether is printing more and more money. My guess is they know they will be found guilty, and are trying to get as much money as possible. Once this scheme is made aware to the general public, I believe it will be one of the largest scams ever.\n\nTether currently has the highest volume out of every cryptocurrency on the market. Many assume that when they collapse, it will not affect BTC at all.  Don't underestimate how much influence Tether has in the crypto markets right now. Without them, everything would drop.\n\nOnce Tether is gone, it will create a liquidity crisis. The money won't just flow to other stable coins, but rather destabilize the entire market:  \n\- Exchanges will stop withdrawals  \n\- Trading will be paused  \n\- Investors will panic  \n\- Prices will crash as people try to sell.\n\nAt the end of the day, nobody knows how long this scam will go on. It could be days, weeks, months, or even years before they are shut down. But educating yourself on what's happening is vital. I'm a huge proponent of Bitcoin, but this isn't sustainable.\n\nTether and Bitfinex are ticking time bombs. You don't want to be around them when they go bust.   Does this sound legal?  \n\- Never had any audits  \n\- Proxy for US Dollar  \n\- Evading AML/KYC regulations  \n\- Violate US Securities Law  \n\- Money laundering  \n\- Caught lying about Reserves\n\n[The original Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/JacobOracle/status/1346133062204198917) was written by Jacob Oracle. I wanted to share this to open up a discussion. I think that every single crypto holder would want to know about this.\n\nWhat do you guys think? How can we make sure that this is not actually happening?\n\nTLDR; Tether's Price Manipulation could affect all cryptocurrencies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kqko6v/tether_price_manipulation/,1,42
