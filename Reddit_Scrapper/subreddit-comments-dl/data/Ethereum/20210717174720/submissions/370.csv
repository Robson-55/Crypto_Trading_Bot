lgsudc,1612960968,Is Gemini good to use? Is the interest they offer worth applying to my ethereum?,"Hello all, I’m new to crypto investing and am looking for some advice preferably from those who have been doing this for a while. My first question would be plainly, is Gemini good to purchase and hold crypto with? Secondly, if you use Gemini, have you opted into their interest on ethereum? If so was it worth it? What are the risks involved? Sorry for the barrage of questions! Thanks In advance and to the moon we go motherfuckers! \nP.S I’m not a financial advisor I just like crypto",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lgsudc/is_gemini_good_to_use_is_the_interest_they_offer/,1,24

lgw05i,1612970857,How to define L2? (Let's decide on a proper definition),"There are many solutions out there that claim to be Ethereum's L2. Some rightfully, but some are just using that claim for marketing purposes.\n\nI think we should develop a proper definition of what L2 is to counter those sketchy marketing tactics.\n\nI think an L2 should tick the following three boxes:\n\n1. It has a 2-way bridge with L1.\n2. It depends on L1 and cannot exist without it (but not vice versa, L1 does not depend on L2).\n3. It derives security from L1 (fully or partially).\n\nWhat do you think about these requirements for something to be considered an L2?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lgw05i/how_to_define_l2_lets_decide_on_a_proper/,3,9
