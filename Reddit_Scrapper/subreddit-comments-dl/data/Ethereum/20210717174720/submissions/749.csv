A few years ago, I read about collaborations between zCash and Ethereum dev teams to bring private transactions to Ethereum.\n\nNowadays, I still read a lot about zkSNARKs on Ethereum, but for a different purpose: scalability.\n\nBut what is the state of private transactions on Ethereum ? Is it still being developed ? Is it already there ? Or will it come ""for free"" with L2 zkSNARKs ? Or is it just put behind because scalability is a more pressing matter ?\n\nI'm surprised that this is not really discussed (or maybe I'm just missing it in the flood).
