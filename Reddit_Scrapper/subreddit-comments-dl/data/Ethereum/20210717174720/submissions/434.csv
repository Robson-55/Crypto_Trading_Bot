lw5bjz,1614700819,Royalties for artists from NFTs associated with physical artwork,"Hi guys, new to NFTs and trying to wrap my head around some specific concepts!\n\nI'm looking for some more information regarding how NFTs might benefit artists with existing artwork or even the families of artists who have passed away. \n\nI understand that the smart contracts associated with NFTs can allow artists to receive perpetual royalties from resales of their digital art, as this is all executed online, including the delivery of the art. \n\nWhen it comes to physical art though, how would you go about including the percentage royalty in the NFT for physical art? Is it a matter as simple as it is with digital art where you just execute everything online except for delivery of the art? \n\nCould someone walk me through how this process might work with physical art? Are there any extra challenges compared to doing this with digital art? \n\nReally appreciate it if anyone has knowledge on this and would be willing to share! Any resources where I might learn more about this would also be amazing. \n\nThanks so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lw5bjz/royalties_for_artists_from_nfts_associated_with/,1,39

lw7ug3,1614706862,Weak statelessness and/or state expiry: coming soon (x-post from EthMagicians),"One of the next major challenges for the Ethereum base layer is that  of dealing with the growing state size: currently around 100 GB  including tree nodes and growing by around 50 GB per year. The growing  state is making it increasingly harder to sync the ethereum chain and to  participate as a validator, and risks increasing network centralization  if the state grows, especially if the gas limit is increased further.\n\nThere are two main techniques being proposed for how to deal with this problem for the short term:\n\n* **State expiry**: remove state that has not been recently  accessed from the state (think: accessed in the last year), and require  witnesses to revive expired state. This would reduce the state that *everyone* needs to store to a flat \~20-50 GB.\n* **Weak statelessness**: only require block proposers to store state, and allow all other nodes to verify blocks statelessly.\n\nBoth solutions are well underway in development, and it feels like  around now is the time to switch gear from seeing these ideas as  research problems to seeing them as concrete paths of which at least one  (and perhaps eventually both) need to be implemented into Ethereum.\n\nEthMagicians link: [https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/weak-statelessness-and-or-state-expiry-coming-soon/5453](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/weak-statelessness-and-or-state-expiry-coming-soon/5453)\n\nSome things I link to inside the EthMagicians link:\n\n* My recent doc on state expiry: [https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/state\_size\_management](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/state_size_management)\n* An idea on how to do state expiry / regenesis while minimizing resurrection conflict issues: [https://ethresear.ch/t/resurrection-conflict-minimized-state-bounding-take-2/8739](https://ethresear.ch/t/resurrection-conflict-minimized-state-bounding-take-2/8739)\n* Verkle trees (very important concept): [slides](https://vitalik.ca/files/misc_files/verkle.pdf), [doc](https://notes.ethereum.org/_N1mutVERDKtqGIEYc-Flw), [code](https://github.com/ethereum/research/tree/master/verkle_trie)\n* Dankrad's case for weak statelessness: [https://notes.ethereum.org/WUUUXBKWQXORxpFMlLWy-w](https://notes.ethereum.org/WUUUXBKWQXORxpFMlLWy-w)\n* Piper Merriam's work on distributed state storage and state and witness availability: [https://ethresear.ch/t/scalable-transaction-gossip/8660](https://ethresear.ch/t/scalable-transaction-gossip/8660) and [https://github.com/ethereum/stateless-ethereum-specs/pull/54](https://github.com/ethereum/stateless-ethereum-specs/pull/54)\n\nHappy to answer questions about any of this!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lw7ug3/weak_statelessness_andor_state_expiry_coming_soon/,1,39
