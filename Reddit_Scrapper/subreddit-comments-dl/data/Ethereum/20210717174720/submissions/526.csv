mskwad,1618637569,Power of DeFi for noobs case study #1,"Case study #1\n\nIf I‚Äôm sitting on a $100k gain, why the hell would I sell? I‚Äôd be liable for short-term capital gains taxes. That‚Äôs ~30%. That‚Äôs 30% of my profits, or $30k. And that‚Äôs not all. If that Ethereum is staked at 8% apy, that‚Äôs another $8000 gone on top of that, but because I‚Äôm rewarded in dividends (or More ETH) for staking, add another $1000. \n\nWhat‚Äôs the solution? Easy, don‚Äôt sell. DeFi promises you never have to actually sell your crypto. If you want to spend, you borrow against it [preferably] with stablecoins. In the future, central banks will roll out their own stablecoin. From here, a borrower can shop for the best rate. If New Zealand‚Äôs central bank has a rate of 2%, I‚Äôll borrow that over the UK‚Äôs 5%. And my staking is offsetting the borrowed interest by several points. Add in the fact my collateral (my crypto) is deflationary to begin with. This is an example of just one of the traditional margins (profits) banks get fat off of. I won‚Äôt get into lending in this post. \n\nLegacy finance will serve the front-end of decentralized finance. And it‚Äôll make the system much better because they‚Äôll be forced to compete nationally and internationally in a way they haven‚Äôt yet. They‚Äôll also have to incentivize crypto users. I believe they will. If they don‚Äôt, the coming atomic swaps with privacy coins (I‚Äôm looking at you Monero) will wreck havoc on taxes, or those cities/states/countries that set up crypto infrastructure and incentives, will be much like the people who bought Bitcoin at 50¬¢‚Äîmarket making whales. \n\nTraditional banking is going to be eaten. Their profits will be yours. This is the promise of DeFi, a system that‚Äôs already a teen even though it was born a couple years ago.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mskwad/power_of_defi_for_noobs_case_study_1/,1,92
