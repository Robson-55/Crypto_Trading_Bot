Friend invested and now thinks ethereum can hit the same price as Bitcoin because I told him itâ€™s the 2nd biggest crypto with real world application( he was into doge before). \n\nExcept he doesnâ€™t believe me when I say ETH wonâ€™t be priced as the same as BTC due to something to do with the marketcap and how it would have to get bigger. I didnâ€™t know enough to explain it to him properly since I just have a loose understanding.\n\nHow would you explain to someone that just because itâ€™s undervalued doesnâ€™t mean it will hit Bitcoin prices?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n3scpo/how_would_you_explain_market_cap_and_how_it/,1,42
