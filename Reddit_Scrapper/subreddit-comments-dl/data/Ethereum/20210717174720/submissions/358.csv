lc1in9,1612394907,"What stops other crypto currencies from having smart contracts? Besides blockchain 2.0, what other advantages are there for ether?","Recently learned about ETH and from what I have read, the main advantages ETH has over other cryptoâ€™s is its smart contracts and blockchain 2.0, and multiple uses. \n\nSmart contracts seem very straightforward, I donâ€™t see why other crypto currencies canâ€™t create smart contracts? Why havenâ€™t they created something akin to blockchain 2.0?? It seems to me that while ETH has the clear advantage of the more technical stuff, Bitcoin and other crypto currencies could easily create something along the lines of what ETH has, no?\n\nIn that case, wouldnâ€™t ETH become obsolete eventually?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lc1in9/what_stops_other_crypto_currencies_from_having/,1,4
