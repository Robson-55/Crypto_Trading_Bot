l8v6pq,1612039307,"When to buy, and what wallet to use?","Bitcoin has skyrocket too much, and it‚Äôs been in the media. I can‚Äôt buy stocks (age), and dogecoin is too much a meme. But ethereum has second highest market volume, no media attention yet, and with the apps the support it it seems actually useful. \n\nI‚Äôm uncertain of when to buy though. Based on historic prices, it will drop again in a yearish. But I don‚Äôt want to miss out on a price increase. Should I buy 50% now and 50% later when it drops/dips?\n\nAnd what wallet? I‚Äôd get a Ledger but that costs half of what I‚Äôd be buying. Is coinbase wallet good enough? I wrote down my 12 words.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l8v6pq/when_to_buy_and_what_wallet_to_use/,1,32

l8w3ck,1612041829,New Trading Terminal,"You guys may want to take a good look at Orion Protocol. Their decentralized terminal will aggregate all the world‚Äôs Centralized Exchanges (CEX) and Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) into one trading terminal, providing very deep market wide liquidity, guaranteed best prices, near zero slippage using noncustodial wallets, so they will never hold your funds. With Orion terminal, trading can never be halted, restricted, or manipulated by big money again. \n\nIn December they launched their beta terminal on the Ethereum Network with 12 trading pairs, but in just a few short weeks they will move to Elrond Network (EDLG) and ramp to 15k trading pairs and offer derivative trading. Elrond Network is 1000x faster and 1000x cheaper than Ethereum with low $0.001 fees per transaction.\n\nORN will remain an Ethereum based ERC-20 token. \n\nThe Orion protocol token $ORN (ERC-20) is now trading at only $3.45 ($58M MC) and is predicted to explode once the terminal is launched. Once live $ORN token holders that chose to stake their tokens, will receive a share of revenue from 16 different revenue streams. \n\nFor comparison, UniSwap is just one Decentralized Exchange, and those that use it know they have very high (because they use Ethereum), in many cases shallow liquidity pools, and high slippage, and despite this they still have a MC of $5.3 Billion, 92x that of Orion Protocol. May at least worth investigating.  \n\nBTW: Elrond Network (EGLD), just 10x in less than 3 months and their payment app Maiar for IOS/Android is going live tomorrow at 16:00UTC, so Elrond is also predicted to continue skyward!\n\nhttps://www.orionprotocol.io\n\nhttps://maiar.com",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l8w3ck/new_trading_terminal/,1,0

l8ys9q,1612049413,Buying/holding ETH is a bigger F*ck you to Wall Street than holding $GME,"I understand the passion and purpose of buying and holding $GME. I get it. I really do. We make the hedge funds bleed out. But to me, this whole cluster f*ck with Robinhood and $GME has blatantly exposed 2 problems with the traditional finance system that Ethereum solves. I understand there are different narratives as to what is happening with Robinhood so I will address both narratives because Ethereum solves them both.\n\nNarrative 1: Robinhood/brokerages banned buying to make $GME crash to protect the hedge funds.\n\nSolution: Ethereum solves this with decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. Something as absurd as banning buying could never happen on a DEX.\n\nNarrative 2: Robinhood/brokerages temporarily suspended buying because the clearing firms raised their requirement for reserves to 100% for the shares of $GME during settlement (takes 2-3 days)\n\nSolution: Ethereum solves this by settling transactions in minutes, not days.\n\nWe need to be pushing harder on marketing this. If the entire r/wallstreetbets community realized how big of an opportunity Ethereum is to take down the assholes in suits, having that momentum behind us thrusting Ethereum‚Äôs use cases into the spotlight would overthrow the shitty centralized system in a very short amount of time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l8ys9q/buyingholding_eth_is_a_bigger_fck_you_to_wall/,1,413
