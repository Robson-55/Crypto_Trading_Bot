I have generated the transaction a couple times, each time using higher and higher gas fees. \n\nI tried as high a transaction fee as .0148 ETH (\~$25). Is this still too low? I know fees are getting out of hand, but this is still not enough? I don't want to keep attempting transactions because the fee is a sunk cost for a failed transaction. Am I doing something else wrong? Could there be another issue? \n\nI have transacted ETH and other crypto thousands of times, so this is odd to me...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lhpszo/ethereum_transaction_fail_from_trezor/,1,9
