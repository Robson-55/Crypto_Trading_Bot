jam0ll,1602621790,Will Filecoin Be The Killer Pedo App for DeFi Fraudsters?,"**Pedophilia remains one of Ethereum's core values, though free speech is not**\n\nIt's a negative stereotype about nerds: They get so obsessed with the technology, they neglect the social impact of their work. \n\nIt doesn't help when childless geriatrics are paying young nerds to skip college. In college, you usually have to take at least one humanities course. Without college, you probably won't ever learn the difference between ""value"" and ""values"".\n\nOne fact about Ethereum that you might not know? It was founded by two pedophilia-supporters, one of who likes to write fan fict about little girls.\n\nIn this industry, there are movers and shakers. Geriatric Joe kicked in the door on crypto and posted up right on the couch saying, ""The adults are here now!"". But it's been 5 years and Geriatric Joe seems to have fallen asleep on the couch. I think Joe should probably get his prostate examined, because he's been sleeping under a wet blanket. Someone has got to move his ratty couch out of here and clean out all the ants and vermin he's left behind. And while they're at it call him an Uber back to Guatemala. Only then can the movers get to work.\n\nEthereum has a culture that, in a typical company, would most likely violate the FCPA. But because this is crypto, taking down evil is a bit different.  \n\nWeak-sauce is the voice of the gleekcoin dev who cringes and tries to deflect what they are and who's around them. When you're on the side of the murdering pedophiles who stole millions of dollars from doctors, you should probably re-evaluate who the bully is.\n\nEnterprises are learning quickly that if they use Ethereum, they're supporting fraud, corruption, and pedophilia. Unfortunately, this won't bring back any dead patients.\n\n**About Filecoin**\n\nFilecoin is a decentralized filesharing network, kind of like torrents, but with encryption and money involved. This means that you can get paid a small amount of money for putting someone else's data on your extra hard drive space. But that data could be anything - especially child porn. You wouldn't know what was on your drive until you got caught, because it's all encrypted. But in all likelihood it would be CP, because Filecoin is an illicit market that's safer for that kind of stuff than say, Amazon Web Services. Filecoin technically hasn't launched yet either -- it's supposed to launch in a few days, on October 15th.\n\nFilecoin was founded in 2017. That same year, Ethereum became the number one platform for little baby pussies, thanks to CryptoKitties. As you might remember, we were told that collecting little baby pussies would be a huge hit. It was all part of Ethereum's theme of pedophilia.  Don't worry - Filecoin will ensure Ethereum is still a leader in little baby pussy innovation.\n\nMost people would look at pedophilia and say ""that's bad"". After all, it's hard to raise a family in a world with strongly pedophilic organizations. But the childless geriatrics and femboy frauds behind Ethereum see pedophilia as just another profit opportunity. When you subscribe to the Church of Ethereum, i.e. ""financial incentives are everything"", you don't care about making sure kids grow up right. You become a heretic: ""Value &gt; Values"". \n\nEthereum users should remember that it's a bad move to go against the best interests of families. Families exist all over the globe, in every nation. They are literally the most international structure that exists. Families and their moral codes, inherently, survive over time. Pedophilia does not. It's not ""regulation"". It's called not-ruining people's lives, especially the lives of little kids who can't protect themselves. If you want every single family in every single nation to go against your shitty values, build things for pedophiles. Btw, you're evil if you think pedophilia is better than heroin.\n\n**Are Fake-Christian ""Tech-Guys"" Too Loyal to Their ""Pyramid-Tribes""?**\n\nThe fake-Christian, childless geriatrics have tried very hard to auction off the future of money to foreign teenagers. Who knew that young Evangelicals who talked like Frodo would grow up to be Boromir, snatching arbitrage algorithms from little boys while saying ""it could've chosen anyone!""? Then again, this is the generation that enslaves with student debt, kills our friends with opiates, and strangles our grandkids with global warming. I don't know what they want the world to look like when they preach ""financial incentives are everything"", especially since their yearly medical costs are more than our salaries. \n\nImagine fearing the face of God so much, you have to inject yourself with the blood of the young to try to slow down your aging. What kind of evil have you done in your life to fear death that much?\n\nImagine having lost so many steps, that while your left hand invests millions in medieval anti-aging therapies, your right hand's ""tribe boy"" steals millions from promising biomedical engineers. That has to be a sign you've lost a step, right? If the left hand doesnt know what the right hand is doing? There's a reason geriatrics aren't supposed to answer the telephone.\n\nThe Ethereum ""community""'s accusations of anal against me are disrespectful to my great big italian penne. My pizza, my pasta, my espresso. To think that I would ever have to do anal for money, when italians make all the best things in the world, it's insane. And for the record, italians don't even fit into tiny boxers, the holes are too small. If we ever did the gay with someone it wouldn't be for money. And what do the Russians even make, besides vodka? \n\nSomeone needs to start putting these fake-Christian criminals on crosses, if we're going to keep pretending this is the olden times.\n\n**Plastic Russian and the Femboy Frauds: A Song of Vodka Versus Pizza**\n\nDo any *real* Russians use Ethereum? Emphasis on ""real"".\n\nOn SnapChat, I sometimes get these ads with 14-year-old shirtless Russians boys with tons of muscles, lifting weights. But looking at Vital, he seems pretty weak. So, are Russians strong like on Snapchat, or weak like Vital?\n\nAnd in some places, Vital is ""Russian"".  But when he's in North America, he's ""Canadian"". I don't know if he's embarassed about being Russian or if it's just some cultural thing. I do know Vital hangs out with the femboy frauds. Doesn't he like to hold hands with them, like all the Russian men secretly want to? Hmmm.... Be careful, Vital! They might try to ""back stab"" you!\n\nHow will all of Putin's money get out of the country safely, without the Goldman Gonad's Ethereum? It fits that the geriatrics screwing over young Americans are screwing over the ""real"" Russians as well.\n\nI guess it's a battle of pizza versus vodka, but it's not really a fair fight when the vodka-drinkers stole the pizza-man's startup funds before he even had a chance to get off the starting line. I was there, in the room, when he called other traders. None of the people he spoke to were doing arbitrage. He's a liar and a fraud.\n\nGive a 5-year-old pizza, they act like it's the second coming of Christ. But give a 5-year-old vodka, and you're probably just a user of Filecoin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jam0ll/will_filecoin_be_the_killer_pedo_app_for_defi/,1,45
