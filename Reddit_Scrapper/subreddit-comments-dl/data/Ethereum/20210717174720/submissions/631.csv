n88r2t,1620543623,Point of view on Stock markets vs. Crypto markets and being late,"Global stock markets are about $100 Trillion. Crypto markets are about $2,5 Trillion. \n\nCryptomarkets are only 2,5% of global stock markets. Meaning, when people ask if it is too late to invest to have life changing or at least considerable gains the answer is no. You are late when all money from global stock markets has flown into cryptos. Ok, I am not sure if all of stock marketsâ€™ capital is going into cryptos, but there are considerable amount of companies that can be disrupted through cryptos or more specifically through applications based on blockchain technology.\n\nWe are in the middle of technological paradigm shift where Ethereum and Layer 2 related solutions like Polygon are key enablers among many others. Any way, more importantly this paradigm shift changes how companies/communities are founded, owned and operated and this shift will keep on going for a while. No one knows how long the change will take and how it unfolds in the end, but this is how I personally look at where we are  currently and in my opinion we are early. \n\nFor me this was just another way of saying donâ€™t worry being late, have fun while investing, but be careful while doing it because there will be ups and downs as we learn what kinds of strategies and products work and bring actual value to markets.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n88r2t/point_of_view_on_stock_markets_vs_crypto_markets/,1,5
