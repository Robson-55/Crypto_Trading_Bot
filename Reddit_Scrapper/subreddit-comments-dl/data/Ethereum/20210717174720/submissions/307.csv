kxqttk,1610701359,IBM Blockchain functionality,"I know this might not be the right sub, but I believe that in here I'll find the more tech savvy Blockchain experts. I am wondering how exactly IBMs Blockchain is working. Their websites about Blockchain are horrible, and give zero insight past the Blockhain 101.  \n\nAre they using Hyperledger fabric? If so how are the different sub-services organized? Are they like Smart Contract written layer 2 Chains?  In how far does IBM have control over permissions on there? I am thoroughly confused by now, as I read through all the IBM Maersk... Websites, but they seem useless. I understand all the implications, but I just want to know how exactly the network works, who appoints the nodes/validators, and if IBM is using PBFT for their customers...",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kxqttk/ibm_blockchain_functionality/,1,2

Sure, the contract says it needs to be done, but what authority is actually forcing the employer to send the money?\n\nOn the other hand, what prevents the employee from faking the task all together?

ky0u6o,1610736090,Will 1559 Result in the Chinese Gaining 51% of the ETH Network Hashrate?,"1559 will result in less revenues for miners. Less non-Chinese miners specifically as lower revenues mean our high electricity prices will make a lot of miners leave. California and many European nations pay over $0.20/kWh for power. Chinese get very cheap power (Lower than 0.03$/kWh) as they have cheap coal power plants. The environmental movement and taxes mean that Western nations cannot compete with cheap non-renewable Chinese power. In addition the Chinese get videocards and asics before us for a lower price, Nvidia sold large batches of 3060ti and 3080 cards to Chinese farms directly before releasing them publicly resulting in massive increases in their profits and card shortages worldwide.\n\nThe Chinese have close to 40% of the network already with Sparkpool Zhizhu and others. Will this proposal give them the 51% they need to control Ethereum?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://cryptoage.com/images/Mining3/TOPmining/ethereum\_pool\_hashrate\_top.jpg](https://cryptoage.com/images/Mining3/TOPmining/ethereum_pool_hashrate_top.jpg)\n\nBut don't worry I'm sure our Chinese overlords have our best interests at heart.\n\nSparkpool and Ethermine are both known as big supporters of the Eterneum Foundation. Take your business to [Flexpool](https://flexpool.io/en/) or other pools that have announced that they oppose 1559.\n\nOnce the Chinese gain control ETH will become worthless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ky0u6o/will_1559_result_in_the_chinese_gaining_51_of_the/,0,14

ky1rbb,1610738711,"Not sure what went happend, did i get hacked?","I have a terrible memory and i have (or had) 1 eth i was holding for the long run on exodus offline wallet.\n\nMy crypto wallets and the information about them where stored on 2 different pc's, with multiple layers of protection.\n\nToday i wanted to check exodus, just to make sure everything is fine and i notice that it was moved at 2 November trough following transaction code:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xfa3d8c39d3a1f0da62598ba804e529f838c9395a8b6acb61729f009a9700b241\n\nNow i really can't figure out if i did this myself or if i somehow got hacked, The transaction was at 2 November, but my first child was Born at 4 November so you may understand things have been kinda hectic since. \n\nI do vaguely remember checking exodus not so long before that, and resetting the wallet using my phrase with i have printed in paper  (Is there a way to check the date when i did this? or a log of every time i successfully accessed my wallet from a certain pc?) I remember everything being fine. I also remember that i had some doubts in how safe exodus was and therefor i don't think its impossible that i chose to migrate to a different wallet. I just can't remember and i cannot find another wallet installed that i would have put it on.\n\nI do know one thing for sure, i aint rich and the other cryptos i dabbled in are barely worth anything, that 1 ETH was my 'big' investment. Therefor while its possible i did put my other cryptos on a the same wallet, wherever i may have put it, its not possible that there is much more total value. I also do not believe i would have put it on any exchange or anything online or used it to pay for anything. The plan was to wait at least another 10 years.\n\nI do however have no idea how all these addresses in ether-scan work, i know transaction are often done in pools but not perse how many or how to figure out what the end destination is.\n\nif i can know for sure where exactly my Eth is right now, i believe i can at least figure out if i still own it or lost it. Any help to clear this out will be massivly appreciated.\n\nSorry, for a prob chaotic posts, i wasn't doing well mentally to begin with, was already 50% drunk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ky1rbb/not_sure_what_went_happend_did_i_get_hacked/,1,7
