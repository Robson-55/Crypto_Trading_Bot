lfx3xy,1612854903,Fitness/Wellness Software on Ethereum?,"Hello, I‚Äòm newbie that blew in with the retail investor/doge hype and have been spending a lot of time researching Ethereum. I‚Äôm currently having a blast and really wish I got into this sooner. \n\nMy question is about the existence of Fitness/Wellness software built on Ethereum, like a MindBody or WellnessLiving equivalent. I haven‚Äôt found anything yet. If it doesn‚Äôt exist, I really think it could be disruptive in the best way possible. I own a dance studio, and the software my business uses allows clients to sign up for classes, purchase sessions and packages, book appointments, etc. Some limited marketing and reminder tools as well as a calendar/schedule feature. It‚Äôs already kinda clunky, but the worst thing is that the software teams with a third party merchant processor, and it‚Äôs a damn racket. Large compliance fees and a significant cut of profits every month. Can‚Äôt go with any other merchant processor because this is the only integrated option. \n\nI‚Äôve been daydreaming about putting our business onto a crypto-powered solution but my customer demographic and industry isn‚Äôt necessarily about early adoption. That being said, I wanted to see if folks could give feedback on this idea and if the front end could be developed so customers without ETH with virtually no experience with crypto currencies could use it successfully. Finally, I‚Äôd like to hear about dapp projects (if any) that might be similar or could be leveraged for this kind of thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lfx3xy/fitnesswellness_software_on_ethereum/,1,0

Let's say you have about 12k set aside. \n\n\nThis equates to roughly 25% of 1 bitcoin at a current market price of $45,000. \n\n\nOr, 7 Ethereums at roughly $1,600.\n\n\nLets say you are ok with not touching the money for a long time, say 10 years. But at the same time, wouldn't be opposed to exiting the market in 2-3 years and taking profit if there is sizable gains in that quick 1-3 years time.\n\n\nWhat would your thought process and and rationale in the decision of picking 7 Ethereums or 25% of a Bitcoin?\n\n\nAs with most things in life, the answer is usually the middle ground, but since this is a hypnotical, if you were pressed to make a binary decision between these 2 choices, which would you go? \n\nCheers",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lfxb37/rationale_you_are_given_12k_do_you_get_25_of_1/,1,53

lg2bkq,1612873664,A Consideration on Voting Power &amp; Wealth,"I was just thinking about the large scale game theory of Ethereum and this thought crossed my mind.\n\nIf voting power is directly tied to wealth in the Ethereum network (when considering the 51% consensus of a hard fork), is the main democratic direction not lying in the hands of the wealthiest once more?\n\nHow is Ethereum accounting for the wealth/voting power relationship that has plagued any possibility of true democracy in the past? Are we not creating another power &amp; influence divide - just with a new face and a new group of people - where the wealthier you are in the system, the more clout you have? (Actually, as institutional investors move to the space we begin to see a mere reflection of the current system.) \n\nThe 1% may be diluted to say 10%, but the wealth divide and wielding of power remains the same. And even if the roles were fully reversed, we've still created an unequal system and we end up exactly where we were... once again.\n\nWould it not be more ideal to distribute equal voting power to anyone who holds a wallet? And is this even possible with the ETH 2.0 PoS model?\n\nI'm not somebody who knows the ins and outs of the tech itself, but as a game designer I'm very interested in the way in which everyday people are going to be interacting with this technology - and what positive change can come from that.\n\nAny thoughts I haven't considered?
