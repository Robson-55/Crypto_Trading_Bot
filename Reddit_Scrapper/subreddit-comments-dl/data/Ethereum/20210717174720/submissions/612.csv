n5m3ox,1620237268,liquidity pool question,"hey everyone, I googled this first but didn't find the answer, hoping you all can help me expand my understanding!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been looking into liquidity pools and I understand the basics.  you tie two currencies together (say UST+ETH) at a 50/50 ratio, to help facilitate trades, and are paid rewards to do it.  As I understand it, there is automatic balancing done, so if one side's value drops, the other side increases to compensate and keep the pool stable (correct me if I'm wrong here)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy question is, what happens if someone is only trading on one side (UST&gt;ETH) but not the other way, how does that affect the pool?  as I understand it, my pool is what is facilitating these trades, so if the pool then balanced the extra UST back to ETH, what is facilitating that trade? other liquidity pools?  if so, how does this not then create an automated spiral within similar pools?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nin addition if there is balancing done to counteract price fluctuations, what causes the collateral value of a pool to drop?  I put a little into one and noticed that the collateral value dropped over the last week, and I'm unsure what would cause this if my understanding of the balancing mechanic is true.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n5m3ox/liquidity_pool_question/,1,3

Yes of course for money‚Ä¶but why? I am looking for the emotional answers. The real deep down reasons. A great story!\n\nThe question seems to have obvious answers, like ""to grow my money!"" or ""to be wealthy!"" If we could avoid those answers just for this topic. \n\nBut I am looking for the emotional why, the real reason why people want to invest or grow their money. During these times it seems like there is always another hidden layer‚Ä¶\n\n- Do you invest to protect your future, so you can retire comfortably?\n- Do you want to make sure you have the money to pay for your child's education?\n- Do you want to prepare for possible sickness and hospital bills when you are old?\n- Do you want to travel, see the world, enjoy luxuries?\n- Do you just want to escape the rat race and have the option to do what you want to do?\n\nMy emotional why, is to give my family a better future. To be able to afford a home where we can grow together and of course stop having to pay rent. \n\nWhat is your emotional why? I would love to hear from all of you.
