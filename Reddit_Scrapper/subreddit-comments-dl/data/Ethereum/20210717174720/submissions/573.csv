n0mpip,1619638139,Why does MetaMask need an internet connection to input/validate a seed?,"Yesterday I installed MetaMask to Brave and selected the input wallet option.\n\nI then proceeded to take my paper backup with my seed. When I was about to input my seed, took the Ethernet cable from my PC to disconnect from the internet.\n\nI wrote my seed but when I hit continue MetaMask was throwing an error. I re-typed the seed, this time with commas in between each word and still got the error.\n\nI was thinking, there's no way this thing needs internet in order to validate my seed, right? Well, I re-connected the Ethernet cable and then 3 seconds later tried to validate once again and... success! (???).\n\n***\n\nCan someone explain to me, why does MetaMask need an active internet connection in order to validate my seed?

n0ncwl,1619639940,Labor Theory of Value in Cryptocurrency,"Is there anyone aware of cryptocurrency being used to implement labor theory of value?\n\nLabor theory of value is the backbone of communism. It states that an item that takes 8hrs to produce will be paid the amount of gold that is mined in 8hrs. (Which is suppressive broken logic, but that's a bit off topic for this post)\n\nA big issue with implementing labor theory of value is that currency isn't mined. The US dollar isn't backed by gold and is inflated and printed willy-nilly. This has been a roadblock in labor theory of value.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrency is mined.\n\nSo  is anyone aware of any movements pushing to use cryptocurrency to implement labor theory of value.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n0ncwl/labor_theory_of_value_in_cryptocurrency/,2,46

First of all the fact that it was ETH made me incredibly bullish. Secondly, this just shows me that even the most dedicated followers of the currently most widely accepted system can at least be enticed to dip their toes in to the wonderful world of crypto currency. Maybe it was the news about Goldman Sachs, maybe it was me never shutting up about Eth 2.0 and Ethereum potentially becoming a deflationary asset to rival the granddaddy himself, Mr. BTC.
