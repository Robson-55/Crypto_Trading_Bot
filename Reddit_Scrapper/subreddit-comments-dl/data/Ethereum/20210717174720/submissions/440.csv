lxknmn,1614865032,Can smart contracts be developed to support businesses that require Trust accounts?,"Hello everyone,\n\nI  have read many articles on Smart Contracts, but I am no expert  whatsoever.  I am still trying to learn and understand the concept of  Smart contracts, and how it can be applied to complex situations such as  the one described in the title.\n\nI  run a small business that requires monies to be paid into a Trust  account until work is completed.  Furthermore, the interest (if any)  must be paid to a specific organization.  The business also requires  confidentiality to be considered by a governing body; which I believe  can be worked out since transactions do not need details when posted  onto the blockchain (AFAIK).\n\nI would like to revolutionize my industry of work by adopting cryptocurrency to my business.\n\nSo  my question is: can Smart Contracts be implemented in a way where it  can act as a Trust holder, and pay out any necessary interest (if  accrued)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lxknmn/can_smart_contracts_be_developed_to_support/,13,6
