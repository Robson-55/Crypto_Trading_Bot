n5os2v,1620244086,new to Ethereum. Are the minimum fees really $4 ???,"I'm used to Bitcoin &amp; Bitcoin Cash, where you can send transactions for &lt; $1 if you are willing to wait. Especially BTC lol.\n\nBut I just tried to move some ethereum from one wallet to another for $1 (8 GAS?) and the transaction appeared, but hours later disappeared. Do low GAS transactions get removed? This doesn't happen in Bitcoin. I can't imaging high fees are required.
