He is manipulator who has used his social media to manipulate crypto market and may have already invited the attention of regulators towards regulating crypto.\n\n Some people even claim he is a trojan horse who represents the fiat-enabled capitalistic system and is trying to destroy crypto from within, because crypto has shaken the goat system. \n\n On a personal level, he has used his wealth to protect another narcissist abuser. He has manipulated the media, including social media to protect  Amber Heard as she continues to perjur herself and not face consequences. It is a kick in the gut to DV survivors.\n\nI'll also not be surprised if he decides to run for office in ten years to come. \n\nDon't give Elon Musk the power to control crypto or he will drive it to the ground.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ndnmsn/dont_give_elon_musk_the_power_to_control_crypto/,1,206

ndobja,1621171627,Responses to ETH critics.,"This might be unpopular, but as I research more and more about crypto and especially ETH, I like to know both sides of project. If I can sit with the FUD circulating around a coin, then I have no problem holding during dips. This is one of the view videos I've seen that tries to break down any ""flaws"" of ethereum. Would love to hear all of your responses! For example, he mentions staking rewards can dilute ETH holders - which can be a legit concern, but then just goes to assume the fee burn rate will not offset that, without anything concrete to back this up.
