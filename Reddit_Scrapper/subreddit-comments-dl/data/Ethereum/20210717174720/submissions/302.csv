kw4pbu,1610497617,Question about dapps,New to to Ethereum. Might be a super basic question but in what way are dapps considered decentralized? Wouldn't an application need to be made by a core group of programmers or company and hence centralized?

kw6p5h,1610504255,Understanding Smart Contracts - For Complete Beginners?,"Hey r/ethereum, \n\nI'll start by saying I'm completely new to Ethereum and I've been trying to do some research on crypto and blockchains in general. I think I have a relatively decent (high level) understanding of those concepts, but I'm really trying to wrap my head around smart contracts. \n\nAgain, keeping it high level, the way that I understand it is that smart contracts are an agreement between parties and executed when certain conditions are met (also public on the blockchain). So basically, as an example, Adam and Tim are engaged in a smart contract like ""**If Adam pays Tim 300 ether, Then Tim gives Adam his house.**"" Using this scenario, I have two questions:\n\n1. How do these two parties actually engage in this contract? Where do they write this up and formally agree (sign) on? In theory, would a dApp need to be created to facilitate this in a more formal/user friendly manner? (I'm still new to understanding dApps as well). I'm trying to understand how this works from a user-facing perspective of engaging in this type of contract (e.g. do they go to a website, sign something on the blockchain somewhere, etc.?) \n2. Seeing as these transactions are ""trustless"" in that there is no central authority, who's to say that if Adam DOES pay Tim the 300 ether, Tim won't just say ""well... I have my money now and I'm not giving you the house."" – Who essentially actually ENFORCES this type of contract, if not a third party? Does the law apply to these as well, in that Adam could get a legal team involved to be sure that he gets the house, as his payment is publicly available?  \n\nOverall, I'm just trying to understand from a real-life perspective of how these smart contracts work, as the ""beginners"" references I've seen are pretty much the ""if give ether, then get house"" example with no further explanation. Any help or pointing me in the right direction is greatly appreciated. \n\n  \nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kw6p5h/understanding_smart_contracts_for_complete/,1,8
