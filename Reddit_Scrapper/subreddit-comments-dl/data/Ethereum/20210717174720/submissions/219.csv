jzjg2v,1606144641,No mans land,"One thing I will never understand is how unallocated funds can not be returned. We all complain about the banking system, but if I send a funds to a wrong account... within a week i get my funds back. \n\nAll transactions have a digital footprint and could not be more detailed. So where exactly is the proplem? Especially ERC-20 tokens, since they all running on Ethereum.\n\nSo yes I did sent AST from Metamask to Coinbase thinking that since it is a  erc20 token it would work. But if the reject why the heck does not just get send back to where it came from. Maybe it's just to flippin smart, to deal with the basics. \n\n\n\nHow complex can that be\n\nRegards\n\nTobias",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jzjg2v/no_mans_land/,1,9

jzlck5,1606150468,ETH APR payments for staking,"I was looking at the launchpad page and noticed the 'interest' payments and penalties would be credited/assessed every 6 minutes or so. Does this mean that there is compound interest or do you get the interest payment credited based only on your original stake?\n\nFor example. You start with 32, you get paid interest 6 minutes later, so now you have 32.05 (just an example). Does the interest get computed on 32 during the next payment cycle in 6 minutes or on the 32.05?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/jzlck5/eth_apr_payments_for_staking/,1,2
