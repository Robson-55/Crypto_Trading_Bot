loie61,1613860199,"Is Ethereum's smart contract infrastructure ""massively overkill""?","I'm not nearly as smart as most of you guys, so, I'd love to get some input on a reply I received recently. Here you go:\n\n""I do agree that PoW should be dealt with and isn't favorable in the long run but Ethereum is a bad example. Ethereum is taking an immense leap with PoS and I hope it proves to be a successful experiment but you also have to remember that Ethereum is at its 2nd hard fork. \n\nImo Ethereum is built on bad foundations and the fact we are heading toward a second hard fork proves that.\n\nI don't think there's a need to begin with to have such a complex smart contract infrastructure in the blockchain. The emergence of second layer protocol like Lightning or Liquid kinda support my theory.\n\nThere are good functioning experiment of service and websites built in top of the LN like Y'alls, Zapread or Microbet. I'm not affiliated with theses sites, I just found them cool. \n\nWith Taproot activation on our doorstep which further improves Bitcoin smart contract capabilities, I don't think there's anything particularly useful smart contract wise that couldn't be done on a second/third layer protocol.\n\nEthereum almost feels like having http functionalities on tcp level (thoses are internet protocol). It's just massively overkill and it makes it much harder to build proper abstraction layers.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/loie61/is_ethereums_smart_contract_infrastructure/,2,5

lom3co,1613871706,Scam?,"I have a friend who is sharing an opportunity that seems too good to be true with Etherium. I‚Äôll admit, this is all very new to me, and a bit overwhelming to try to learn. Basically, it‚Äôs an opportunity where you invest at a ‚Äúlevel‚Äù 1-11. That determines how much ETH you own. You then refer others to invest at whatever level they can and earn ETH back from this. According to this person she earned her until investment (about $1200) back the first day. You keep you etherium and make money through smart contracts on the ‚Äòplatform‚Äô they use. To be honest, it sounds a bit scammy, but as I said, this is new to me, so I thought I would ask those who know a lot better than I do. She is in a group full of people on Facebook who all partake in this platform and are making a lot of money doing this with getting people to sign up and using these smart contracts.

lonzv9,1613878354,Eth2... Such confusions! So concerns! ;),"A bunch of Eth2 questions, from a person who's been out of Ethereum for awhile. Not a newbie to Eth1, but n00b to Eth2..\n\nWhat even is beacon net, from a practical perspective (I've read the techy description)? Since mainnet is unconnected to it, what does it even do? Especially for a year?\n\nThe docking timeline indicates that beacon comes first, then Shards come second, then finally mainnet docking, as its own shard (perhaps a special shard) -- but what even will the predock Shard chains do, if they aren't integrated with mainnet? And I've read it still is unlikely they will even be able to do contracts. So what WILL they be doing for a year+???\n\nIt is specified that users stake (minimum) 32 ETH to stake, and then participate on the beacon net (later shards), and get rewarded for doing so with ETH... ETH conjured or supplied how??? And is this reward ETH likewise one-way staked? Or is it granted to the staking user on the mainnet address?\n\nI read lots of talk about mainnet docking... but blockchains like Ethereum are at the end of the day controlled by miners, not by developers. What is the *incentive* for miners to presumably upgrade to dock? If that switches the main chain to PoS then the miners' expensive hashing hardware becomes obsolete--they lose all their investment in that. Conversely, they can only make money on the new net by staking. What if the miners **don't want to dock**? Will this be yet another fork? And what about the smart contracts, now being depended upon globally? ""There can be only one""... It sounds like a minefield--I haven't read anything discussing all this.\n\nFor a roadmap, I'm deeply concerned about all the ambiguity and ""options"" in Eth2. For example, right on the ethereum.org page about Eth2, they talk about a variety of options for shards, such as whether they will have state and be able to process contracts, or not, and several others. How can you be barely a year away from a major architectural change to the network, but still debating a wide variety of ""options"" of things to do??? That sounds more like a fantasy story treasure map than a real world roadmap!\n\nHow can you shard contracts across chains? It would seem a single contract and all its state would have to live on a single shard. What if one contract makes calls to the API of another? That sounds like a remote procedure call across shards. I'm no expert on any of this, but it seems highly problematic.\n\nI tried finding answers for these questions, but I find the Ethereum documentation to be kind of hard to navigate--I seem to either get stuck in the clouds of fluffy generalities with pretty pictures on the main pages, or taken deep into things like long lists of EIPs or a highly subdivided wiki that makes it hard to connect everything together... (sorry if I just haven't learned how to learn well enough yet...)\n\nWhat is Berlin? Why is there no ""News"" and ""Upcoming Events"" links on the Ethereum website? If something really major is happening in, say, April, shouldn't I be able to easily look that up, and see a coherent timeline?\n\nThanks for any helpful information.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lonzv9/eth2_such_confusions_so_concerns/,0,21
