hy7ld9,1595772771,How will Ethereum 2.0 be taxed? [For US Taxpayers],"Under the current US tax rules, when a crypto asset is bought and later sold/converted, one must pay either short or long term capital gains on the sold/converted asset depending on how long it was held. Will going from ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0 be considered a conversion? If so, am I correct in assuming it would create a taxable event? Can there be a case made that ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0 is just an upgrade and it's still the same ETH coin? (Staking early on should help mitigate any taxes due to this conversion, at least) And once a validator is staking, I assume they must report staked interest received during that year as income?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hy7ld9/how_will_ethereum_20_be_taxed_for_us_taxpayers/,1,26
