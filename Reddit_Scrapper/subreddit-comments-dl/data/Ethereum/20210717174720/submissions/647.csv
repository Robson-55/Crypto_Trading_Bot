n9x38y,1620739925,A favor,I have a friend who was scammed so I am trying to help. Everyone that helps me get him reported and taken down from IG and then comments here with a wallet and I can go see on IG that all of his accounts are reported and taken down then I will deposit 10$ of any crypto onto that wallet. I know it‚Äôs not a lot but it will take a lot to report and have the scammer taken down. His IG is bitcoin_fund_manager. He has a ton of IG accounts and is going around scamming people. My friend just wants him to stop scamming people and IG doesn‚Äôt care. So this is what it will take. So if anybody wants to make 10$ then fine. If not then fine. All up to you guys. His name is Kim. He also has a fake website of https://bitcoin-whale-club.com/user/.    Be careful and spread the word.

Paying gas isn't just annoying but seems to make many dapps prohibitive. Take for example a twitter clone but every action you take cost you $10; upload a profile pic, like a post, comment. I mean some people could afford it but they wouldn't want to interact much even then. In terms of growing the Ethereum ecosystem, I think this is holding back dapp dev and adoption. I know there are ways to offset this like providing tokens as incentive but I can't see that making a difference until performing actions to cost &lt;10 cents. Will high gas prices be a thing of the past or will devs have to find other ways around this? Will increasing adoption of Ethereum take us back to square one?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n9ybg3/ethereum_20_and_expected_gas_prices/,1,14
