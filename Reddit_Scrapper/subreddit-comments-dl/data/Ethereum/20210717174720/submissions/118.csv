idj6kw,1597958453,$VI and the VID app with an interesting UBI model," VID ( [https://vid.camera/](https://vid.camera/)) is a project similar to BAT and the Brave browser, the concept is simple, combine a social media app like Tik tok with incentives, democratizing and revolutionizing the social media interactions. No more data been aggressively taken from you, no more privacy issues, you just get paid for social media engagement by the projects that want to capture you on the space.\n\nAlready has 7k downloads just for the iOS app, soon the Android one will be released and more campaigns will be rolled out. The team is very well rounded especially the CTO who has a ton of experience in app building.\n\nThe token economics is what sets it apart, as the more success the system has the more value get's distributed to the users and the more engagement and people are brought in the more one can get in terms of revenue. Now the incentives come from companies, that buy VI to distribute to people as incentives and 90% of ads or other marketing instruments paid by the companies in VI tokens will get burned. The token release schedule is simple ‚Äì 7,000 tokens are released per day, which will be distributed over 312 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/idj6kw/vi_and_the_vid_app_with_an_interesting_ubi_model/,1,2
