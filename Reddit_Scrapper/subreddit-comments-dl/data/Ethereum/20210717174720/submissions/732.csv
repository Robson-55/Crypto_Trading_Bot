nom2mq,1622413135,Crypto Niches and Rewards,"Crypto Theory: This is just a theory of Crypto that I‚Äôve been thinking about. Crypto is going to move into Niche based currencies more than they already have. Currently we have Meme tokens as a niche started by Doge. Now I‚Äôm seeing signs of others starting to take over other types of worldly niches. Look at what Emax is currently doing. This currency is molding into a sports niche. From what it looks like, this coin is striving to dominate the World of Sports. This is actually really interesting ü§î. Look at some of the rewards you get for using Emax to purchase Mayweather v Paul tickets. Things like a percentage off / signed boxing gloves if you spend $5000+ / etc. This reminds me of Credit Cards and how different cards give different rewards for using their cards... So... What I see is a possibility of Emax not trying to compete with the big dogs, but rather dominate as the currency to use for anything Sports. What if we eventually get other currencies to dominate other niches like travel / services / etc. What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts on this?
