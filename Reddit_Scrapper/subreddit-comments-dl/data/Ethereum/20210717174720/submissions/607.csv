n4y6nm,1620162158,This Startup Program on gate.io exchange is giving lot of gains (around 2000% gains) from the public sale price,"Recommend to watch video to get complete information with actual price charts showing 20x gains(2000%)..\n\nVideo link: https://youtu.be/HC83nSDWM50\n\nHello this is cortana and i Welcome you guys to cryptofinity.  So today's video is very important , many new things i am going to introduce to you guys,             \nSo this video is all about Gate.io Exchange (link given in description) and how can you gain thousands of dollars each day on this exchange. So let's start. gate.io is no.8 exchange according to volume, and it has 619 coins to trade more than any other exchange. And it never got hacked. And this exchange has everything just like all other exchanges like future trading , staking, crypto loan and all, but most importantly the startup program in this exchange gives profits on another level. So here is this LIOG launch and you can see it's public sale price is around 0.036 dollar , and look at the launch price all time high its 0.97 dollars, which is around 2700% gain. And this happens in every startup token , and fortunately 3 coins gets launched per week . I am showing you guys all these other startup tokens launched recently and had gained literally around 1000% , which is a big gain,  but there is one condition you need to be vip 1 or above, for that you have to have 1.5 btc in your wallet or if you invite any of your 3 friends then also you become vip1 so this is one big thing about this Exchange which can gain very big money in short , and no risk involved. And now i am going to tell you the coolest thing ,yes you can make and watch other people social trades on this exchange , you can follow them and you will get notification about thier trades and you can also do the same trades , also here you can see there all ongoing and previous trades, so just find someone who gains everyday and just follow them. So these two things are only available here on this exchange. Tell me how much you liked this exchange. Also show your love to us. Thank you..\nVideo link : https://youtu.be/HC83nSDWM50",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n4y6nm/this_startup_program_on_gateio_exchange_is_giving/,1,0
