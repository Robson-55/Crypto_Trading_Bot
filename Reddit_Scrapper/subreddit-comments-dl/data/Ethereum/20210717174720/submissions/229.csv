k3iqpd,1606688587,I'm developing a lending protocol completely based on Uniswap's liquidity pool tokens,"It will accept Uniswap's LP token as collateral in order to borrow the two tokens of the pair of that pool. It will use an innovative collateralization model that will allow to achieve high leverages on LP tokens at a low risk.\n\nThe most interesting thing is that this will open a new lending market for AMMs that will bring them more liquidity. Moreover, borrowers will be able to indirectly provide liquidity to AMMs without any exposure to impermanent loss! The whole liquidity providing market for AMMs will become more efficient as investors will have tools as leverage that will allow them to manage better their risks.\n\nI've been working on the project for a while, but for the first time I'm sharing it publicly. You can read more about it on the website. Check it out and give me your honest feedback.\n\nOfficial website: [https://impermax.finance/](https://impermax.finance/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/k3iqpd/im_developing_a_lending_protocol_completely_based/,1,6
