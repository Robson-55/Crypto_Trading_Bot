nnu7b8,1622315436,"What would the implications be for ethereum-based cryptos (like Polygon, just for one example) if Ethereum 2.0 rolls out successfully?", I'm new to understanding crypto in general but what would be the technical and financial implications for ethereum-based coins if Ethereum 2.0 rolls out completely and successfully? (I'm talking in like 2023 and beyond if ETH scales 1000x like the devs hope.)  It seems as if systems like Polygon are sort-of doing with L2 chains what ETH 2.0 hopes to accomplish.\n\nWould a successful rollout of ETH 2.0 bolster sidechain technology like Polygon or would it render such scaling solutions redundant and obsolete?\n\nSorry if this is a dumb question but this is something like I feel is basic and I should know.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nnu7b8/what_would_the_implications_be_for_ethereumbased/,1,40

nnusfs,1622317313,A currency symbol for Ethereum,"Justin Drake recently posted on Twitter about the need for a Unicode character for the ETH currency: [https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1397930556763955200](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1397930556763955200)\n\nI posted a suggestion in that thread for a currency symbol which seemed to garner some appreciation. Since posting that suggestion, I have been thinking a little bit more about if we could instead start from the Greek uppercase Xi character which is becoming well-established. By adding two thinner vertical lines, it can:\n\n1. function as a unique Unicode character for the Ethereum currency,\n2. be easier to identify as a currency symbol (a problematic aspect of the Xi symbol),\n3. retain the already established style.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n[Ethereum currency symbol](https://preview.redd.it/r3rqv2xn24271.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a458fb41b304d57f0f14a4dfcbc2af5cab173347)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ethereum currency symbol in text](https://preview.redd.it/5q32qlyv24271.png?width=14000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d598850ddb6236ac3890773059d4bf21a51617f8)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nnusfs/a_currency_symbol_for_ethereum/,1,23
