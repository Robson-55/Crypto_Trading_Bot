n8iei3,1620579657,How can I get coins out of the eth network? Is there no other way?,"Thanks in advance for answering my noob question.  I wanted to start playing around in Uniswap and other dexes so I moved some USDC into a wallet address, but now I just want to get it out.  To do anything, I seem to need eth, including converting it to eth.  I've tried connecting to various dexes through coinbase wallet, metamask, and trust wallet just to see what kind of options I have.  \n\nDo I really need to acquire new eth, send it in, use that new eth to pay gas to transfer my USDC out, paying gas fees at every step, then have this leftover eth just floating around I can't do anything with? If I want to send the USDC to an exchange, swap it to another coin, or whatever?  There's no way to turn this USDC into eth and have the gas fees taken out of this amount (or do anything else useful), without sending in outside eth first?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n8iei3/how_can_i_get_coins_out_of_the_eth_network_is/,1,10

n8j5iy,1620581826,converting eth to ada," Hello! My portfolio consists mainly of cardano and ethereum. Got like 40 percent of each plus 20 percent of other coins. Lately I have been thinking about converting half of my ethereum to cardano because I think I ethereum will do a 4X from now max, while I think cardano might do moreX.  What is stopping me a bit though, is ethereum feels a bit safer. Cardano is a lot ofâ€¦talk. What do you, internet strangers, think I should do?
