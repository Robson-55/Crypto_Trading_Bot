j8tst2,1602369160,Tokenomics advice for a mintable ERC-20 smart contract?,"So I have a use case where I'd ideally want to create a mintable token that will take part in an unlimited number of crowdsales, but the token creation will be volume controlled over time. Very similar to how ether itself handles minting. Each crowdsale allows the smart contract owner to raise money for a project, the coin value after each crowdsale will be linked to the investor reception of that project. Over time as volume increases, the value will be tied to a holistic representation of the contract owners return on every crowdsale project. Token volatility is dependent on the contract owners reliability and reputation.\n\nThe volume control governance will restrict users from failure to pull through with their projects multiple times. AKA repeat scam artists. Unlimited minting restricts the ability for users to treat their contract as an acquirable asset, instead it is meant to be a flow of credit for their work.\n\nAm I off base in how I view the economics of this model? Does this logic hold water?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/j8tst2/tokenomics_advice_for_a_mintable_erc20_smart/,1,5
