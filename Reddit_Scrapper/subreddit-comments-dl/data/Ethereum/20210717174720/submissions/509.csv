mmdk41,1617834202,How to give a gift related to crypto? NFT?," \n\nBackground: Family member gave me a decent amount of $$$ before I went to college last fall, I sent a postcard back but have subsequently made decent sized gains on coinbase and metamask despite having no real knowledge. An NFT looked like an interesting gift, is there a way to send them to someone? Otherwise, could I just hand them them my metamask account with an NFT in it? I've cashed out but it holds a smattering of tokens and evidence of gains as well. They are definitely tech literate and were in the space in the early 10s - i just think it'd be a way to show a kinship - we aren't really close.\n\nTLDR: Can you gift an NFT or safely transfer an account which holds an NFT or what is another gift related to crypto where the $$$ amount doesn't matter?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mmdk41/how_to_give_a_gift_related_to_crypto_nft/,1,1
