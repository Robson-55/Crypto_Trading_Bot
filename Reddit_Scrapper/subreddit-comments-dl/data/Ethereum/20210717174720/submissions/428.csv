lszln5,1614352160,[ANN] ConfessIt - Egalitarian Exotic Decentralized Autonomous Community - OneOwnershipEnsuredByNFT,"[*https://confessit.io/*](https://confessit.io/)\n\n*When anonymity meets with the power of decentralization to democratize church systems. This is the beginning of a bigger results which will be shared throughout of this document.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith COVID-19 we all have to face another global issue like global  warming; global depression. ""Splitting the word out"" is a proven  strategy to get some relief and cope with the situation.\n\nThis  is the main motivation of this project, make people trust each other  and make them happy. It is not bounded by only church, church is the  starting point.\n\nIt is a project want to prove even non-tech users can use and understand the main concepts of blockchain philosophy:\n\n1)Anonymity\n\n2)Power of Decentralization -&gt; Democracy\n\n3)Their results: TRUST\n\nFor  example, you register here and share about your experience, this  sharing gets voted for 24h by the community for a cost proportional to  the inverse of ""trust"", which is calculated by a concept named,  non-fungible token.\n\nAfter 24h, your sharing  gets hashed to the network, nobody can see the content after 24h. If %51  of the community decided it as ""confession"", you rewarded by 1 COT,  confession token, if it decided it as ""admission"", you rewarded in ADT,  admission token.\n\nThe reward for ADT is calculated by following:\n\n\[(your COT#/ total COT#) \* 100\] ADT\n\nIf you trust the system and gets more COT, your trust to the system rewarded by the system itself.\n\n\*\*\n\nIt  will be implemented using ERC-1155 and as a result, it is not adding up  cost to the mainnet and transactions cost will be low.\n\n\*\*\n\n\*\*\n\nThis  project might be a revolution for the crypto-finance industry, because  before it, a chain-account is not have an identity concept, with this  project, you can barrow/rent token/coins in the future, because you have  a perfect identity in the blockchain: an NFT token named COT, who  encapsulates your secrets.\n\n\*\*\n\n\*\*\n\nAll  of us have the same question in our minds, ""What is the value of this  digital representation ? How it worths some money at all? ""\n\nThe ConfessIt project is the only project can answer this question in 2 Words:\n\n*Your Secrets*\n\n\*\*\n\nVote Cost = \[1/ your COT #\] ADT (meaning of ""cost proportional to the inverse of ""trust"""" )\n\nThe Idea was developed by Cihangir Umithan Goktolga.\n\n[https://twitter.com/confessit\_io](https://twitter.com/confessit_io)\n\n[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5318655.new;topicseen#new](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5318655.new;topicseen#new)\n\n[https://save-ideas.com/explore/idea/6035af358715d9001316cea8](https://save-ideas.com/explore/idea/6035af358715d9001316cea8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVisualization of ConfessIt:\n\n[https://confessit.io/business-logic-1](https://confessit.io/business-logic-1)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lszln5/ann_confessit_egalitarian_exotic_decentralized/,2,5

lt2x09,1614360501,"How non-fungible are digital NFTs, really?","I'm an Eth coder (Solidity/Truffle) thinking about getting into the NFT space.  I can't wrap my head around NFT's for purely digital assets.  For the classic definition of a non-fungible asset (i.e. - something that is not interchangeable or replaceable) I can easily understand:\n\n* **Real estate**.  Someone owns the title to a piece of land and you try to take it or use it, here comes people with guns (the police).\n* The **Mona Lisa**: Someone takes it or destroys it, it's gone.  Period.\n* Even the **dollar**, which although it is a physical piece of paper, its value has nothing to do with its physical incarnation.  However, if you try to reject it as a form of payment (in the USA), or you try to print your own, here come *really* scary people with guns\n\nIn those cases there is strong enforcement due to asset being a physical asset or the threat of physical force, which in some cases isn't violence but bankruptcy through a lawsuit.  So if a pop artist turns one of their songs into an NFT, what is the actual enforcement power behind it?  A scary lawsuit?  Public shame?  What?  What unique, enforceable rights do I have as the NFT owner?\n\nOr is it the reality that in the majority of cases most NFTs for digitized assets are actually just ""bragging rights"", or affection from a collector, or the claim of a big lawsuit when there's not really an effective way to do damage with one, either due to the courts not taking it seriously or because the digital asset can be easily copied in a way that can not be stopped?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lt2x09/how_nonfungible_are_digital_nfts_really/,11,14
