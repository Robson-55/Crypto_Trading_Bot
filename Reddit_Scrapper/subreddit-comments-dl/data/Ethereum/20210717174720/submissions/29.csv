gyxka5,1591615558,All About Smart Contract Audits ‚Äî 7 Most Burning Questions,"&gt;***TL;DR*** **üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄ**: *Covered the top FAQs regarding Smart Contract Auditing in this post/video. Would love feedback from the community*.\n\nA single bug in a smart contract has historically resulted in a loss of millions of dollars in blockchain projects. Right from The DAO hack in 2017 to the DForce hack &amp; the Hegic contract bug in 2020 millions of dollars have been lost. There is a dire need for high-quality Smart Contract Audits ‚Äî but there is an equally dire need for clarity on how audits are actually performed.\n\nMy colleagues Ish &amp; Nitika sat down for a discussion recently, addressing some of the most frequently asked questions on smart contract auditing.\n\n*Full Video on* [https://youtu.be/ms9xNtq9Y0w](https://youtu.be/ms9xNtq9Y0w)\n\n[Ish &amp; Nitika on All About Smart Contract Audits](https://preview.redd.it/7a5pvdnt6o351.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a5e22fa10f3859c21babb8a681375d41af9fd73)\n\n# 1. How do I know when I‚Äôm ready for an external smart contract audit?\n\nSpeaking from our experience, we would classify smart contract audits broadly into 2 categories ‚Äî an interim audit and a full security audit.\n\nSo, if you are building an application with complex components already coded, and want an expert to look at them with a fresh pair of eyes for any vulnerabilities and to ensure that you are headed in the right direction, we recommend opting for an **Interim Audit**.\n\nFor example, if you are building a lending protocol, there are complex components like distribution of interest which require a lot of due diligence. When you are building something big like this, you want to make sure you are on the right path and following the right approach before it reaches a stage from where you cannot backtrack.\n\nThe other type of audit is a **Full Security Audit**. If an application is complete from a developer‚Äôs standpoint with all the functional level testing in place at the developer level and you wish to launch the product on the main-net, it is time to get a full security audit done. The job of the auditor in a Full Security Audit is to find security vulnerabilities in the smart contract code.\n\n# 2. What is the duration of an audit?\n\nThe duration of the audit is subject to various parameters like business requirement complexity, code quality, dependencies, integration with existing protocols. Again, we can classify smart contracts broadly in three categories from a timing perspective.\n\nType 1: If it is an ERC20 smart contract, it does not take a lot of time to audit due to the standardized nature of ERC20 contracts. In such a case, audits are often achievable within 48 hours.\n\nType 2: Token Sale Contracts that have custom token economics or extended ERC20 contracts with additional features often are considered as Type 2. The TAT for such contracts can be anywhere between 1 week to 2 weeks.\n\nType 3: Full-blown dApps / DeFi projects around lending, borrowing, insurtech, prediction markets, derivatives, DEXs are more complicated from a business logic perspective. The time to audit such projects depends on the goals of the developers. It can be a 3‚Äì5 weeks process eventually leading to a more regular engagement.\n\n# 3. Is the Audit report private?\n\nThe choice to make audit reports private or public is the developers' decision. For interim audit reports, developers generally prefer keeping it private since their project is a work in progress. Interim audit reports are more like consulting where you need a direction from an expert, so it makes sense to keep them private.\n\nIn the case of full security audit reports, developers generally opt for releasing the audit reports in public. That is their way of building trust within the community.\n\n# 4. What will I find in the audit report?\n\nA typical audit report from Somish Blockchain Labs would look something like this:\n\n**Basics** section which includes the mention to the audit collateral that was given by the developers to the auditors. This typically includes code commit number, areas of audit and the smart contract addresses that have been audited.\n\nThe **understanding** section where the intended behaviour of the project is defined. This section depends on the documentation provided by the developers in the form of whitepapers, BRD, SRS etc. The clearer the documentation, the clearer the intended usage understanding.\n\n**Issues** section that is categorized into 3 sub-sections: Critical issues, major issues and minor issues\n\n**Critical Issues** ‚Äî Issues that can lead to the locking/theft of user funds. Also, issues where the smart contract owner has rights to play with user funds.\n\n**Major issues** ‚Äî Issues in business logic from a security point of view. Also, issues pertaining to the intended usage of the application.\n\n**Minor issues** ‚Äî Issues with low chances of occurrence and low impact on the code as well.\n\n**Notes** section provides a note around gas optimizations, compiler checks and some other stuff which can be implemented at the discretion of the developer.\n\n**Recommendations** section contains our recommendations (wherever viable) on how to solve the identified issues by our team. Adopting the recommendations is at the discretion of the developer.\n\n# 5. Which technologies do you work with for audits?\n\nWe have worked on Ethereum, Hyperleger Fabric, EOS and IOST platforms. Most of our audits have been conducted on Solidity, Golang, Node and C++ languages.\n\nGenerally, we use static analysis tools like Slither and security tools like Mythril. These tools give us a long list of basic vulnerabilities that could exist in the contracts. When the developer provides us with test cases, we run tools like solidity coverage to find out what‚Äôs the coverage of the unit test cases. It gives us an idea of what kind of scenarios have been covered and how deep the testing has been performed.\n\nWe also use tools like solgraph, which gives us a flow of the code and presents an overall picture by plotting a graph from that piece of code. It helps us analyze the complexity of the logic and the scope of the calls, whether it is external or internal.\n\n# 6. What differentiates automated audit from a manual audit?\n\nIn a manual audit, apart from using standardized tools, the auditors examine each and every line of code manually and use their experience to understand vulnerabilities that are otherwise hard to find.\n\nIn an automated audit, also known as **Formal Verification**, there‚Äôs a tool that has certain rules defined which can run on a smart contract and provide an automated report as an output.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to conduct formal verification of complex projects because defining the rules is cumbersome. Formal verification for contracts that have been standardized over a period of time like a simple ERC 20 is very common. The custom contracts, however, need a more extensive look and manual audit is the suggested way for them.\n\nFormal Verification is a topic that is still being researched. We recommend going forward with manual audits only with teams who have experience and knowledge of this space.\n\n# 7. How much does a Smart Contract Audit Cost?\n\nThis is a question that does not have a straightforward answer and oscillates more in the realm of subjectivity. The cost of a smart contract audit depends on the contract, complexity of the contract, how well the test cases have been written and also the lines of code.\n\nThe complexity of the contract is the single most important parameter determining the cost of the audit. The specification document and how well have the test cases been covered also influence the costing. A well-written test case makes the life of an auditor much simpler and reduces the effort required.\n\nThe short answer, however, is: give us the code and the documentation, and we will get back to you with a quotation! :)\n\n\------------\n\nIf you have any questions regarding Smart Contract Auditing that were not covered by us, please feel free to respond to this post or write to us on [audits@somish.com](mailto:audits@somish.com).\n\nI would also love your suggestions/feedback in the comments below üôè",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/gyxka5/all_about_smart_contract_audits_7_most_burning/,3,0
