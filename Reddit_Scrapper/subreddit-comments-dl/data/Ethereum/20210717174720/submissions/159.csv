j0dvqt,1601154433,Ethereum scalling dissection,"I am trying to figure out how will ethereum scaling play out and what I got wrong.  \n\n\n1. POS won't make much difference, its a bit more optimized then POW, but basically we get the same scaling\n2. Beacon chain as the first phase of 2.0 is just for bootstrapping later phases and also doesn't change much on scaling part\n3. Rollups (and others L2) will make TPS from 100 to 2000, but If I am correct all L2 solutions are not part of ethereum core project and it is just a matter if someone uses those L2 in their Dapp?\n4. Sharding is a some way to go, and in the first phase, it will just have the possibility to scale normal transactions but not smart contracts as this is more complicated.  \n\nAm I missing some important part for scaling and where ethereum could get more TPS and when?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/j0dvqt/ethereum_scalling_dissection/,1,11
