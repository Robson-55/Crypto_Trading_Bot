7homru,1512466513,Scam Ethereum Mining apps on Android?,"Had anyone else noticed the advent of free apps on the Google Play Store that claim to mine Ethereum at a slow pace? They claim that once one hits a certain amount (0.5 ETH - 1 ETH), one would be able to transfer that to an ETH wallet with a 3 day delay. And there are, of course, ads rolling on the bottom of the screen, almost too conveniently out of the way and unassuming. \n\nAlmost all of these apps have a ton of five-star ratings and usually over 500 one-star ratings, which is a lot for any product.\n\nThe one star ratings all tend to say the same thing. The transfer just doesn't happen. One person ""reverse-engineered"" one of the apps and said it didn't even have any type of mining ability, it was just a counter and a random number generator for the speed!\n\nI figured it would be good to get the word out about these, since they somehow made it into the Google Play Store.\n\nAs an aside, does anyone know of a legit, functional app that would enable me to mine ETH on Android? I have unlimited data and a great device, so it seems plausible that it would be able to mine, albeit however slowly.

7hontz,1512466965,Student looking for a direction of where to find help in order to do his bachelor thesis,"Dear community, this semester I'm finally going to finish my bachelor at uni. \n\nThey actually added a topic about blockchain that I took immediately. \n\nI have to develop an unisystem for courses and gradings and stuff, just like the typical uni-system that is used everywhere. And it is ethereumbased. I've learned the basics about smart contract developing, and was able to understand lots of things just by trying it out. \n\nBut there is also much more questions that I actually have, so I was hoping that one of you could point me towards the right direction in order to find useful resources and to get help if needed.\n\n\nThanks &lt;3",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7hontz/student_looking_for_a_direction_of_where_to_find/,1,4
