7psqq0,1515717287,Mining to a Nano S via Ethermine question.,"Evening all,\n\nHope everyone is well.\n\nI know what you're going to say, don't direct pool rewards to the Nano S. This is totally understandable as if my understanding is correct a lot of transactions will make future payments extremely slow and will also cause a chance of hardware failure if the device runs too hot.\n\nJust out of curiosity however, as it's playing on my mind and I am looking to purchase a Nano S. Lets say as an example, if I was to increase the minimum payout to 5 ETH and have it pay out to a wallet address assigned to the Nano S, how would the Nano S then reflect this payment as being made? \n\nIf I understand correctly, the transaction/money is always made and recorded online via the blockchain and the Nano S securely provides the private key to the wallet which receives the transaction. So, does the Nano S basically sync with the blockchain once plugged in to an online device and then the balances are updated and reflected on the Nano S?\n\nSorry for the weird question, it's midnight and I start thinking about irrelevant things way too much.
