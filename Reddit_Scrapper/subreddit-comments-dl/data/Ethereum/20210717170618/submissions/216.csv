There are a lot of questions that are just dedicated to help on an individual issue and the share is constantly rising - yet, we are still not mainstream. \n\nI personally think that it would make sense to guide this type of questions to a different (related) subreddit (like /r/ethtrader and /r/EtherMining) to ensure general issues won¬¥t be spammed and individual issues addressed in an appropriate matter.

7osxe6,1515355416,Pointless Posts,"A lot of mindless posts from the moon crowd. We are supposed to be ahead of the curve here, so how about some intellectual conversation? I'll start.\n\nSo if the world economy becomes majority cryptocurrencies, how extreme do you think the move will be towards an entire United Earth? With a global, transferable currency that moves peer to peer; I would imagine that lots of cross border relationships will be built that could have never found each other before. I see this as the first major step towards a United human race versus each country for their own. \n\nIf that takes hold, what are some future use cases for a platform such as a ethereum (other than Dapps that are currently being developed). In what ways could you think of solving global issues that are hard to solve with our current divided economies? \n\nI love Eth, and there are some wonderful minds working on projects, but as always more ideas create new innovation. Instead of discussing current prices and moon landings, we should be discussing potential use and get involved with our devs. If we continuously brainstorm, the people with the know how may be inspired?\n\nThanks üòÅ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7osxe6/pointless_posts/,398,183
