Which I did yesterday.  And again today, I sent a third with a gas price of 0.0021 ETH.  I still cannot see the transaction on the blockchain.  Yesterday, the original transaction 0x2848b7ef2c294d7a1f7b3e0b5ab377d01baf422f4fdf6761ca9a08738047e6cf was viewable and was in a ""pending"" state.  Now nothing shows up.
