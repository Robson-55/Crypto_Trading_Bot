7clmo9,1510559019,pay with ether!,"Lately I've seen a few posts here on /r/ethereum where small online merchants ask how to start accepting ether from their customers. On the www.ethereum.org home I see sections about downloading ethereum and building Dapps, but nothing about using ether as a payment method. Shouldn't we add a short intro with a ""how to"" link? Something like ""Start accepting ether as a payment"" (suggestions are welcome). \n\nDon't forget that ether is already a good crypto and using it for payments should be one of the most basic use cases. Plus having more merchant accepting it is a (very) good way to spread its use.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7clmo9/pay_with_ether/,86,44

7cmup3,1510577249,How do I convert a lowercase address to a checksummed one?,"I am trying to send some ETH from Luno to Kucoin but every time I hit send Luno blocks the transaction saying that the Ethereum address I'm sending to needs to have both uppercase and lowercase letters (EIP55). The problem is that my Kucoin ETH address only has lowercase letters and I simply cannot send the ETH. I did some googling and research and I found out about Geth's checksum converting code on GitHub but it is literally just squiggles on a screen to me coz I am illiterate beyond measure when it comes to code. I have been trying to type inputs into the code and run it but it's super clear that I have no idea what I'm doing. Please can someone help me out with steps to follow to convert a ""unchecksummed"" lowercase eth address to an eth address with both lowercase and uppercase letters (checksummed)?
