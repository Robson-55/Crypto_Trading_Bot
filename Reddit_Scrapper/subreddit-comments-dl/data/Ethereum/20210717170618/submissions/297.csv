7u0do8,1517311646,How many Ethereum accounts do you have? (&amp; why?),"How many ETH accounts (all together) you have - I mean combining different wallets like myetherwallet, MetaMask and so on plus also accounts on exchanges? \nAlso, of course we do it for security reasons, but are there any other reasons for that? If so, what are they?\n\nIt's important for me because we're working on building a product for the Ethereum community and we were wondering if the feature where you could sum all your accounts to have a full view on your assets would be useful?\n\nSo answering the questions would help our users and us so much - because we want to know real needs.\n\nAnd if you want to check out our platform you can do that here by checking:\n\nTOKENS: If you would like to check for example ZRX- 0x tokens you can do that here: https://trivial.co/t/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498 (the number in the link is just a smart contract number of ZRX - you can check it with any different token on Ethereum blockchain). You can here also 20 top token holders of a particular token.\n\nACCOUNTS: If you would like to check the balance or tokens of any address - you can do that here: https://trivial.co/profile/XX - where XX is any account number.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7u0do8/how_many_ethereum_accounts_do_you_have_why/,27,50

7u20xd,1517328374,Supporting/Promoting PoS development threatens the viability of the Ethereum network,"What we have works.  We have a secure system that becomes more and more expensive every day to try to hack.  We also have a hardware community which is dumping capital into supporting this blockchain which has the ability to disrupt (and improve!) trillions of dollars of commerce globally.  That is huge. \n\nWe also have a very real problem.  And that problem is scaling.  We have ~75B of ICOs which will bring their apps online this year.  Those apps are being written by incredibly talented teams who are going to bring wonderful products to market.  And those apps are going to be very demanding on the Ethereum network. \n\nIn order for Ethereum to succeed, the focus right NOW needs to be scaling.  Yes, PoS can have scaling, but so can PoW.  And PoW currently WORKS.  \n\nIf we do not get scaling in place this year, Ethereum will fail.  And if Ethereum fails, it is very possible that confidence in crypto-currency in general falters.  \n\nMy opinion is not popular.  Every 3 posts I see on this subreddit are people asking for PoS.  I find that to be wildly irresponsible.  PoS is going to be very difficult to implement.  It will take time.  And during that time, if the Ethereum network is inoperable (remember cryptokitties?), developers will move elsewhere.  Capital will move elsewhere.  And Ethereum will die.  \n\nPoW uses energy.  A lot of it.  Yes.  We are all acutely aware.  But guess what? It is working.  And maybe this is just the way it is going to be for the first 5 years or so.  AND THAT IS FINE.\n\nWhy? Because I am looking at the bigger picture.  I want Ethereum to be successful.  I want to remove all the middlemen out there who are charging us insulting rates (I'm looking at you, Ticketmaster).  I want for disruption to take place.  I want to remove power from the banks and the lobbyists.  And that CAN HAPPEN.  \n\nBut it will not happen if we focus on and demand PoS today.  WE NEED SCALING TODAY.  \n\nYes.  I fully understand that PoS is expected to have scaling.  But how long will that take to put into place? Are we willing to jeopardize this global movement because people want to save energy and for their Ethereum to moon due to staking? \n\nEthereum will moon with adoption.  Ethereum will moon with scaling.  Global interest will moon if Ethereum is successful.\n\nAnd then we can focus on PoS.  After we have proven to the world that crypto-currencies do have a place and does bring value to the global commerce system.  That is the time to focus on improving the system and reducing electricity consumption.  I think that is a wonderful long term goal.  But it is the wrong short term goal.  The short term goal is making Ethereum successful.  And that requires scaling.  Which can be done today on the PoW system.  Which works.  \n\nIf it ain't broke, don't fix it.  \n\nTL/DR: We need scaling.  PoS development will take too long to implement with scaling.  The focus needs to be scaling on the PoW network.  \n\nMandatory Disclaimer.  I am a GPU miner.  I  have invested in supporting the hardware network of this ecosystem.  I am being compensated by the system for doing that.  I also own Ethereum and fully believe it's value will increase with adoption and use of the currency.
