7l1pfz,1513780146,Dapps and speed vs security thoughts/questions,"Hi all, I've been a big fan of ethereum for a long time and *still is*. One thing I've been thinking a bit about lately is what degree of decentralization most dapps would actually need to be sufficiently secure for their purpose. So Ethereum seems to be trying to achieve perfect security whereas some of its competitors compromise a bit and will (possibly) offer higher transaction output, but less security. I therefore find it quite plausible a lot of dapps would rather be built on other chains because they don't need perfect security? This is more a question than a claim, I'd love to hear some arguments against/for this. I also realize this is highly theoretic, because those competitors really only exist on paper as of now. Finally, maybe this is where plasma/raiden comes in and provides sufficient speeds?
