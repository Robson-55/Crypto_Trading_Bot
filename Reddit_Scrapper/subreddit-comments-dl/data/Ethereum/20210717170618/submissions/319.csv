7vlf9c,1517897712,"Someone please make a delivery DApp, it could easily be the real world Cryptokittie catalyst we need.","So hear me out on this, for my technical experience with Ethereum and its smart contract aren't nearly as proficient as I'd like it to be, but I feel with our current tech it should be attainable. Let us assume you want a delivery of a good, but fuck delivery drivers, lets get a Delivery THRIVER^TM\n\n**First off**\n\nLet's all be honest with ourselves, the real reason we get delivery (of anything! Food, toilet paper, plain brown boxes totally not filled with sex toys) is because we don't want to risk running into someone we know and having to actually socialize; and running off that idea we can agree that if we had the option to choose a delivery service that didn't require use to awkwardly run for a pair of boxers to open the door for the pizza that arrived 10 minutes too early *^^Don't^judge^me^I'm^naked*, we would choose that service. \n  \n*""Oh but PokyHickory, what does having a DApp have to do with people knocking at my door.""*\n \nSit the **FUCK** down and get your mind blown, I got three words for ya.\n\n* Smart\n* Lockboxes\n\nDelivery guy comes to conveniently located drop box (or hot box for food?), puts package into one of [these bad boys fitted with smart locks](https://www.johnplanck.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LONDON_WESGATE-APARTMENTS_067-2-1024x685.jpeg), interacts with the Delivery Thriver DApp which locks the package in tight, as well as sends a claiming token to the purchaser's ETH address. You get a notification of your package arriving, and can comfortably go grab your package at *any*time(As agreed upon in the contract). It's a convenient, relocating mailbox for any goods at any time, so long as it fits in one of those mailboxes of various shapes and sizes. \n\n**~~""Oh, but what problem is this really solving other than your social anxiety.""~~**\n\nI'm feeling personally attacked but ok, as with all things in smart contracts we're adding security for EVERYONE! What if after 2 hours the food still hasn't been picked up? Well, the smart contract can send out a secondary token to a Delivery Thriver for collection, and upon collection can validate the food was never taken, the driver still gets paid for a job well done, the potential customer can get a partial refund, and the restaurant gets paid for its operating costs as deemed in the contract signed by the customer, effectively cleaning up a useless slot for another delivery to enter. Chuck in the fact you can easily send packages out of warehouses with non-fungible ERC721 tokens attached to record the metadata of the entire trip, from variations of temperature and g-forces for sensitive products, or for showing that the customer was full of shit when they said the package never really reached their front door but the FedEx guy swears he put it on the right doorstep. It's a contract that allows everyone to win, and ensure fair compensation and peace of mind to all parties. \n\nThoughts/Criticisms/People that can code this instead of me cause I work 65 hours a week as a delivery boy for pizza, please discuss below!\n\nTL;DR\n\n1.Driver gets delivery (Food, mail, discreet package, etc)\n\n2.Delivers to [Smart Lock containers](https://www.johnplanck.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LONDON_WESGATE-APARTMENTS_067-2-1024x685.jpeg) which can only be locked/unlocked via smart contract\n\n3.Opening tokens distributed as necessary\n\n4.Package taken, funds distributed, process repeated, happiness ensured",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7vlf9c/someone_please_make_a_delivery_dapp_it_could/,0,5
