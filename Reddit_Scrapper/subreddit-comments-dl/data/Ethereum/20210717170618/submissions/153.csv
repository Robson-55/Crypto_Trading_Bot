7l0tsy,1513769342,Information for miners on how to improve their uncle rate,"During the recent days the Uncle rate of the Ethereum network has again increased significantly as it can be seen [here](https://www.etherchain.org/charts/unclesPerDay).\n\nWhile most large mining pools manage to keep a reasonable low uncle rate, lots of smaller miner and mining pools exhibit a unusually large uncle rate as it can be seen [here](https://www.etherchain.org/charts/topMiners).\n\nGenerally we found Parity to cause an elevated uncle rate with a large tx queue. Therefore limiting the tx queue size to 8 times the current block gas limit seems to significantly reduce the uncle rate. This can be done by running Parity with the following argument: *--tx-queue-gas 70000000*. Furthermore if you operate multiple mining nodes it is always a good idea to establish a direct connection between them by adding them as a reserved peer.\n\nIf anybody has some suggestions for Geth on how to reduce the uncle rate, please feel free to share.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7l0tsy/information_for_miners_on_how_to_improve_their/,180,33
