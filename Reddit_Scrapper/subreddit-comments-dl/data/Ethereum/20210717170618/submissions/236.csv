7ppvql,1515693241,Parity new token,"Forgive my grave ignorance. I'm on windows 10 and ran cc cleaner and I believe that wiped out my parity appdata. I had a backup of the two folders and dragged those into the respective spots in local and roaming. When I went to go and launch ptray.exe it would close immediately. The parity.exe file launched but when I loaded up the web interface it told me my token was invalid. After trying the suggested ""parity signer new-token"" I kept on receiving an error message stating \n\n    C:\Program Files\Ethcore\Parity&gt;parity signer new-token\n    error: Found argument '--can-restart' which wasn't expected, \n    or isn't valid in this context\n\n    USAGE:\n        parity-1.8.0-9882902f312fd720b839df9aac45bc7d30c01590 \n    signer new-token\n\nI tried to find a config file to change but there does not seem to be one in the local or roaming folder.
