7jeiv2,1513117603,Can ERC20 tokens/smart contracts be malicious?,"Maybe someone more tech minded than me could answer this one. I recently participated in an ICO for a crypto lending platform that sent out it's tokens to anyone with an ERC20 compatible wallet. \n\nWithin a few hours, more than a million tokens disappeared from a bunch of people's Ether wallets after they were delivered. They got sent to ""etherdelta_2"". Whoever this person is has over a million stolen tokens and has been tanking the price by selling them on Coinexchange.io every day.\n\nIs it possible that the creator of the token could've put in malicious code into the token or smart contract to automatically send the token to another address after it was delivered to the original recipient's Ether wallet?

7jfipb,1513126608,Decentralized Law?,"So, here’s your downright crazy read for the day:\nI’m super new to the idea of Ethereum but after some cursory reading, I’m getting the sense of “something something decentralized apps”. With that kind of nebulous understanding, I just had a little intuitive jolt:\nWould it be possible to use Ethereum as a decentralized means to implement law? I just...I got this glimpse of a world government without lawyers.\n\nAs a programmer, I’ve always had this idea in the back of my mind to make a legal language that could be parsed and interpreted by a program. Contracts would be written up in code and any disputes would somehow be settled instantly by the code, or maybe by comparing against the code. So, no judges, no lawyers. Only programmers.\n\nI guess the setback to a decentralized world government is the lack of a monopoly on violence...but, maybe laws can be enforced another way.\n\nAnother idea I’d always had in the back of my mind was a decentralized government where the individual has the totality of power. In other words, instead of a federal government being the highest power (as in the US), and states second, then local governments, then the individual, etc, what if the precedence of law started at the individual? Complete individual sovereignty.\n\nCSS (cascading style sheets) comes to mind as a rule system where individual entities subscribe to a rule set, but can also override any of the rules for individual purposes.\n\nSo, imagine a bunch of people living in an area. By our human nature, we look to cooperate in our community. Someone in the community would write up a contract or charter of sorts detailing general rules they say they’ll be following. Other people would maybe write up their own versions or agree to adopt one of the charters already written. When a person adopts or writes a charter, it becomes law for that person and/or their land. Because we generally look to cooperate, there’s a good probability that a charter with good fitness would be adopted by all members of the community who have the same views. If another group of people have different views in that same geographical region, they could follow their own charter and adopt provisions that allow for cooperation with adjacent and dissimilar charters. In addition to adopting a group charter, the individual could put their own provisions in their charter that details laws specific to their land.\n\nFrom the standpoint of our current legal system, that would be a huge mess. But, if there was a decentralized system to interpret and process charters instantly and logically, dispute resolution could also be handled instantly. You could look up individual charters instantly. There would be no dispute of who was right and wrong.\n\nLarge scale operations, like building a road, would be written up in a charter and then agreed upon by all the individuals whose land the road would reside on. Maybe there can be rules written into the program to facilitate large scale operations, possibly imminent domain. Maybe if a parcel of land has 60% or more of adjacent land that follows a single charter, then that parcel’s charter has to have provisions for cooperation, or something. A program could be written to search through potentially effected charters and output potential conflicts.\n\nI’m not saying I have all the details laid out...and I’m certainly not saying this is a great idea, but there seems to be something here.\n\nOkay, that’s the end of my crazy talk. Is this something Ethereum is built for?\n\nI have a good sense I’m going to end up deleting this because I sound so crazy right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jfipb/decentralized_law/,10,9
