7ub9qy,1517417457,"Are addresses generate by ethereumjs completely random, and how are they derived?","i.e. using ethereumjs-wallet.\n\nAre they generated just randomly? I'm guessing they arrive at a 40-hex private key and then derive the public key and then address from that.\n\nBut how do they get to these private keys? Is it truly random? i.e. even though the odds are astronomically small, is it possible to randomly generate a key pair that already belongs to another wallet?  Or even (yes, I know, it'll never happen over the whole age of the universe, but i'm asking theoretically) generate the same wallet twice in a row?\n\nI know this is possible in theory if things are totally random, but I'm wondering if ethereumjs has some odd feature in place to limit this. like, i guess it wouldn't be too tough for a program to generate keypairs that are only ""new"" (to that protocol). That is, make sure every 40-digit hex combo has been hit before re-generating one that has already been generated.\n\n(not that it matters for my question, but I realize that even if they implemented something like this, another wallet generator could randomly generate a keypair that has been given out by the ethereumjs-wallet. but some mechanism like this would only help, right?)\n\nSo, is it truly random? or does anyone know if there is some kind of process to prevent ""doubles"" from happening, or is it just entirely depending on statistics to not let that happen (which I'm fine with, i'm just wondering).\n\nthanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ub9qy/are_addresses_generate_by_ethereumjs_completely/,1,5
