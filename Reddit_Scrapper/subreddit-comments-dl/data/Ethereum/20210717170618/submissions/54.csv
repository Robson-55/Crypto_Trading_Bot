7etybo,1511382134,How-To: Ethereum transactions for &gt;$0.000001 using MyEtherWallet,"Based on the excellent statistics of https://ethgasstation.info/ I noticed that transactions are possible for less than 0.1 Gwei. By default the MyEtherWallet interface does not allow you to select less than 0.1 Gwei as Gas Price. Here is how you can achieve transactions for almost nothing (example using Chrome):\n\n* Open MyEtherWallet\n* Right click on the ""Gas Price"" top right gui element\n* Select ""Inspect"" from the context menu\n* Expand the html element &lt;ul class=""dropdown-menu ng-hide"" ng-show=""dropdownGasPrice""&gt;\n* Expand the html element &lt;div class=""header--gas ng-binding""&gt;\n* Find the html element &lt;input&gt; below and double click the ""min"" property value\n* Change the value to ""0.000000001"" (this is 1 wei) and press enter\n* Ga back to the MEW window and slide the slider to the left until it says ""Gas Price: 1e-9 Gwei""\n\nNow you can create a transaction as normal. A test transaction when through in a 7 minutes spending the absolute minimum of 21000 wei, see; https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3f1a289dea7fc433e1d8e4198b39f879c7f19bde2667065ff7a8b8a4aa3a10ab\n\nAccording to ethgasstation there are currently 17% of the miners that accept this low gas price setting, with a probability of 93% for mining withing an hour! No guaranties for the future...\n\nEDIT: as noted in comments, actual transaction costs were $0.0000000000075",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7etybo/howto_ethereum_transactions_for_0000001_using/,66,31

7euk66,1511387116,ERC20 Wallets: Random Questions,"Hey folks,\n\nI have a few questions about Ether and other ERC20 token storage and wallets.\n\nAll I understand about wallets are that they allow you to interact with the blockchain. My question is what exactly that entails. Does creating a wallet create an address on the blockchain only accessible by the key for storing the tokens? Or how does that work?\n\nI'm assuming it's the same way for ERC20 tokens? If not, how are universal wallets like MEW able to be universal?\n\nThen, with cold storage devices like Nano Ledger, are those only storing the wallet key? So if I want to ""store"" my crypto on the ledger, all I'm actually doing is moving it to a location on the blockchain and then storing the key on the ledger?\n\nThanks in advanced - I'm a little confused about how managing my own wallet works.\n\n**Edit to add** Am I to trust wallets like MEW never permanently lock up my Ether? I saw the parity wallet fiasco and that is somewhat discouraging. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7euk66/erc20_wallets_random_questions/,5,6
