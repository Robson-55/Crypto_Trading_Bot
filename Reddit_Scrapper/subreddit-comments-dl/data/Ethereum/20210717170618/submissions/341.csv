7xaz3l,1518542637,McAfee's Ethereum ICO founder indicted on 29 federal charges,"I used to trust McAfee because of his business background, but because of the ICOs he has been promoting  (which he proudly admits he is paid to promote) I have lost all respect and believe he may be driving himself into serious legal peril. I don't know how much damage he may be doing to the Ethereum name itself, but most of his ICOs are based on Ethereum so I can't imagine he is helping the cause.\n\nIt seems painfully obvious to me and just about everyone who understands cryptocurrency, but I am amazed at how many people on his Twitter account reply with enthusiast thanks and appreciation when he puts stuff like this out.\n\nHere is just one of many examples (I posted this to r/CryptoCurrency  yesterday after doing just a modest amount of due diligence on his new Knowledge.io ICO):\n\nJohn McAfee has sent out a few tweets from his official ""officialmcafee"" about an ICO that he just became an advisor of. He has joined the ¬†Knowledge.io ""Knowledge Token"" ICO that started today, but he may not realize that the individual behind the ICO was recently indicted and arrested on 29 federal charges. \n\nThe FBI and USA Attorney General are leading the federal case, for which a surprising amount of public records are available.\n\nAccording to¬†http://ImmersiveEducation.org/alert  (the educational non-profit that owns the""Knowledge Token""¬†trademark) public records indicate that the individual responsible for the ICO's unauthorized use of the¬†""Knowledge Token""¬†trademark was just indicted by the United States Department of Justice on 29 federal charges including conspiracy, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, and currently stands accused of defrauding a health clinic out of $2.8 million.\n\nI don't have a Twitter account, but would love to see his response when he realizes that he might end up on the wrong side of the federal government over this and other coins he pumps (and in his most recent Knowledge.io ICO tweet he is very clear about the fact that he is paid a substantial amount of money to promote this ICO).\n\nIf you happen to join in on that Twitter discussion please let me know, since it's hard to keep up!\n\n\nBabs",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7xaz3l/mcafees_ethereum_ico_founder_indicted_on_29/,22,28
