7d7sq8,1510784912,All my Ethereum stolen right out of my wallet,"Just wanted to warn everyone and/or ask for help.  I had my Exodus wallet open and I walked away to take a shower.  When I had returned all of my ETH had been sent away without my permission.  I'm not sure what to do.  But be careful.  \n\nThe Transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe9d940eb31c490b98802ad368fa15d9c06b3336240b70b8e4ba1f303354a4956\n\nThe address that stole my Ether: 0xca2909f8c9e9f656eb468d53c84c23063e2dec4c\n\nIf anyone could help that would be greatly appreciated.  I know most likely my funds are gone forever but thought I should at least let others know. \n\nUPDATE:  All my BTC is gone now too.  Looks like I'm fucked.\n\nUPDATE 2: First off, I'd like to thank everyone in this thread for both their kind words and advice.  I've responded to JP (Exodus Co-Founder) down in the thread but I'll copy and paste most of comment here. \n\nWhile it makes me feel like a dumbass, I did attempt to check MyBTGWallet as I was curious about BTG and wanted to know if there was any to claim etc. Initially, I went to https://bitcoingold.org and saw their address check box, after inputting my address, I seem to recall there being a link to https://mybtgwallet.com/ underneath the box. So, I clicked on it and was brought to the site, but as I was extremely hesitant to give out any of my information, I tried to assure myself it was legit. It displayed a valid SSL Certificate at the time of my visiting so I decided I would proceed. Unfortunately, this makes it pretty clear that it was all my fault. I'm embarrassed to say the least, and certainly heartbroken at my losses. I guess I'm a little new and didn't think much of it when I was asked for my seed, looking back that's pretty fucking stupid, there's no reason they my seed right? But the valid SSL had me fooled. I will surely never do something so stupid again and will take steps to increase security on my own. However, I do think BTG and MyBTGWallet should take some blame for this as they are not ensuring the security of their users/potential users but ultimately this is clearly my fault.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d7sq8/all_my_ethereum_stolen_right_out_of_my_wallet/,170,248

7d8qaj,1510793542,Questions About Electrum and MEW.,"First, can I set up an electrum wallet offline? or do I have to set up a cold storage wallet while my machine is connected to the internet? Second, when I send coins to that address how does it get to my wallet? \n\nMy understanding is the coins just get tethered to the wallet address in ""cyberspace"" and never actually gets to the wallet, but my private key allows me access to them once I want them and connected to the blockchain. Is this correct? \n\nAlso when I create a wallet online, say with MEW, how does the blockchain know it is an address if the machines and wallet never connects? or is it simply the transaction file it reads and sends it to whatever address it says whether it's valid or not?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d8qaj/questions_about_electrum_and_mew/,0,7
