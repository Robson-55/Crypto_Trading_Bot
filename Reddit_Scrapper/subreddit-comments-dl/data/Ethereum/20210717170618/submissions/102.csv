7i3tpb,1512619322,Using personal tokens to distribute income,"This idea isn't necessarily specific to Ethereum, but using the Ethereum network and a personal token was my initial idea. \n\nI'm sure there are legal hurdles, but what would it look like to distribute one's income to token holders at a fixed interval? The idea here is that if ""X"" tokens (coins) exist, then the token administrator would distribute their income ""Y"" to coin holders in the form of some other cryptocurrency. \n\nIn a fictitious example: Joe creates a token: JOES. Joe nets $6,000 per month and is going to distribute 100% of his income to coinholders. There are 1,000 outstanding coins, so each coin would receive a monthly payment of $6. Joe, needing to pay his bills, hangs on to 50% of his coins, so he receives 50% of his income. \n\n The price of the token would obviously be bound to the potential earnings of the token administrator, plus whatever perceived upside would be built in. Should the coin value go up, Joe's under no obligation to hang on to his 50%, he can sell (or buy) as he sees fit. \n\nObviously, the entire system revolves around Joe being honest about his income (is there a good disclosure mechanism?) and not shafting token holders. \n\nI call it: the MyPO (public offering). Goofy? A touch. Plausible? Probably not. Fun to think about? Absolutely. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7i3tpb/using_personal_tokens_to_distribute_income/,1,2

7i45cv,1512623036,what needs to be decentralized and what doesn't?,"Personally, when I heard ""world computer"" I was thinking global trade between two parties without common law or currencies to bind agreements. And perhaps trickling down into personal domestic agreements that ain't worth fucking with lawyers to duel it out in court. Maybe, eventually becoming an under the table payroll and profit sharing solution. \n\nI didn't imagine flash games for little girls would be jammed into the blockchain. There's no reason that content can't be hosted on private servers or personal computers.\n\nI will admit that there were some red flags with lots of stupid buzzwords like ""4k VR social media self flying IOT drones"". I thought those were just vaporware scams and hopefully that's all they are. These concepts just don't make any goddamn sense. There's no reason to put such a thing on the blockchain. Centralized servers are your best bet for dedicated performance.\n\nIt would be one thing if the blockchain were congested with poorly managed decentralized exchanges or micropayment solutions. Which was certainly a problem I could comfortably foresee. But loading cat pictures, (not even that cute I may add) is just a nuclear disaster.\n\nI'm not jumping ship or trashing ethereum.
