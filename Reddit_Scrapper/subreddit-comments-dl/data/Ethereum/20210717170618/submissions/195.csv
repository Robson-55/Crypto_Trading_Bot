7npfvu,1514927532,Should I use the official Ethereum wallet?,"Hi,\n\nI have a little amount of ETH on an exchange and I would like to send them to a private wallet, instead of keeping them on the exchange.\n\nFor this, I downloaded the wallet from https://www.ethereum.org/, ran it and... wait.\nOh... I'm still waiting. \nI know, it is downloading the blockchain... It's running for several hours, consume 12GB of RAM memory out of the 8GB available on my computer (it's running on swap), and it is hammering heavily the hard-drive (not SSD).\n\nSeeing how ressource intensive is this process, I'm wondering if there is another safe and easy solution to store and use my ETH without storing them on the exchange (or any other web service)?

I have had trouble getting the sample size I need to I am offering a chance to win 0.13 Eth to the survey-takers if I can get to about 500 responses. I realized that amount is not a lot but it is all I have for now (I am not making any money off of this). \n\nHere is the survey link if you are interested: \n\nhttps://s.surveyplanet.com/ryk7BorzM\n\n\nThank you for reading.

7npzhg,1514932124,"Coin Trade Alerts - A followup to my ""viral"" post; New Website &amp; More","*If you don't know what i'm talking about, check out [my previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7njsnq/had_a_2_week_gap_between_my_last_job_and_my_new/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage)*\n\nFirst and foremost, i'd like to thank /r/ethereum for the **RIDICULOUS** response to my first iOS app. Almost 800 upvotes and 13,000+ views in 18 hours. INSANE!\n\nOne of the main things that you guys were asking me was ""Why only iOS???"". I started building the website 4-5 days ago (while I was waiting for the App Store approval process) and am proud to say that i'm ready to debut it in it's earliest form:\n\nhttp://cointradealerts.com\n\nThe website offers the same functionality as the app, so now **ANYONE can use it, not just iOS users.**\n_____________________________________________________________\nAdditionally, another concern that was expressed by a lot of users is the safety and security regarding providing your API key, even if it's view only, to a stranger, and I FULLY understand that concern.\n\nIf you head over to http://cointradealerts.com/do-it-yourself I've provided instructions on how to set up the EXACT same functionality locally on your own computer. In doing so, your API key does not leave your possession and you can still receive the exact same alerts! (If you need help setting this up, don't hesitate to send me a reddit PM or email [alerts@cointradealerts.com] and I will do my best to help you get it up and running)\n\n_____________________________________________________________\nWhat's to come? Well, I start my new job tomorrow, so I will be limited to &lt; 3 hours a night of development time, but that won't stop me from continuing to develop this application.\n\nHere's what's on my plate:\n\n* **Security Alerts**: Configurable alerts when transfers are made on your account. The intention of this is to provide immediate notifications should your GDAX account be compromised.\n* **Tax Reports**: With the press of the button you can generate all of your cryptocurrency trading history to aid you in filing your taxes.\n* **MORE EXCHANGES**: I'm leaving this one up to the community. If you guys want me to add functionality for your favorite exchange than let me know and I will be happy to do so. Adding more exchanges is really only a few lines of code for me!\n\nAdditionally, I will do my best to make all of these updates to the website (main focus) and maybe the iOS app (smaller focus) as well as standalone scripts that you can set up and run on your own without needing to give me your API key!\n_____________________________________________________________\nLastly, a lot of people requested that I add a donation page, and I've done so on the website by adding my wallet addresses. I'm going to reiterate what I've previously mentioned regarding this: Donations are absolutely not expected. I'm fortunate enough to have my dream job doing what I love at 22 years old and i'm totally okay with covering all my AWS costs (Messaging costs in the future). However, if you really feel the need to, the option is there. People have brought up that they would be interested in 1 time charges for the new features, however, I would feel guilty (unless this got MASSIVE) accepting money like that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7npzhg/coin_trade_alerts_a_followup_to_my_viral_post_new/,1,0

It seems several exchanges upped their default gas price during the height of cryptokitties mania and left it there (Binance, Bittrex). I’m seeing nothing but 51-55 gwei gas price txs from these exchanges which seems overpriced right now. I know EthGasStation has an api that can be used to for median / standard / safe gas price determination, but it seems none of the exchanges are utilizing it, in favor of steadfast defaults. IMHO it is resulting in an overpayment of fees incurred by their customers and not a very friendly operating model. I suppose the argument can be made that it guarantees they get into blocks during periods of high stress, but I feel like that’s a poor practice that actually artificially drives the safe / median gas price up for the rest of the network as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7nqhzw/exchange_gas_price_defaults_and_fees_question/,3,3

7nsjyz,1514957276,Two small questions on the Ethereum protocol I had and couldn't find answers to easily on the FAQ and other resources,"1) When is smart contract work done? For a while I had the understanding that the ""proof of work"" on Ethereum was just doing an iteration of all of the smart contracts on the blockchain, but given that Ethereum is shifting away from proof-of-work in a while with Casper, that's obviously inaccurate; it's really just a standard PoW protocol that's been designed to be memory-hard and hence inefficient to run on currently extant custom chips. How do you know someone's going to bother to run your smart contract when something you care about happens? Who does your fuel payment go to, and why can't they just invoke you a million times maliciously just to run your code to little effect and have an excuse to automatically grab your ether?\n\n2) How exactly does storage on smart contracts work? From what I've read, it seems as if you have access to basically unlimited access size associative arrays, which seems pretty ridiculous. Is that just shorthand for a hidden heap data structure that's actually taking a ridiculous amount of computing resources hence fuel hence ether hence money to read from/write to, and you should implement an actually sensible data structure instead to save that money? I get that it costs fuel to write data, but reading is also important.\n\n2a) Assuming that storing data on a smart contract isn't as nice as it seems, what's the standard way for dealing with it? Do you offload that data to some external service with an API, build a blockchain-based DBMS to deal with your expensive storage as efficiently as possible, or what?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7nsjyz/two_small_questions_on_the_ethereum_protocol_i/,25,8
