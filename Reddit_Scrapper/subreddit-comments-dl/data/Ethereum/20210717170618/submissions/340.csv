7x82et,1518510822,[blockie-picker] Upgrades! Now with wallet downloads,"I made some [upgrades](https://github.com/eth-button/blockie-picker/commit/c49acc56d1021ad15e8e8399a8db9b5bbf0f8ec3) to the [`blockie-picker`](https://eth-button.github.io/blockie-picker/) utility I wrote a couple weeks ago. `blockie-picker` is a tool to allow one to generate a new vanity address not based on the hex encoding of the address (like `0xcafe...`) but on the appearance of the standard identicon.\n\nOne of the upgrades was to factor out all the address generation code to its own library, and add in the ability to generate a [compliant wallet](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Web3-Secret-Storage-Definition).  This led to the creation of [`lib-address`](https://github.com/eth-button/lib-address), another simple library for a single purpose: generating Ethereum addresses.  As mentioned, this comes with the ability to generate a wallet for said account, by way of using [crypto-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js).\n\nThis means you can now download easily download a wallet for any address you take a liking to!  Simply click on an identicon you like, enter a strong password in the password input, click `Download Wallet`, and wait a few moments (it takes a while to do 200,000x iterations on pbkdf2!), and your wallet will download.\n\nFurther improvements across `blockie-picker`, `lib-address`, and [`lib-blockies`](https://github.com/eth-button/lib-blockies) include the adoption of `eslint` for better code standards.  More improvements are planned!\n\nAs always, don't trust me. Read the code, check the dependencies, clone the repo yourself and run it locally, or all of the above, before using a wallet generated with this utility.\n\nTrust, but verify.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7x82et/blockiepicker_upgrades_now_with_wallet_downloads/,4,2
