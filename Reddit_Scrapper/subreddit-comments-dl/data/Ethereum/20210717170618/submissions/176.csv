7mcibp,1514345414,Confidential Transactions on Ropsten,"So I found a bit of time over Christmas break to experiment with Confidential Transactions.  I finally have a working prototype for a CT Token on Ropsten ([link](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xeace8fbe35577a892a01a05220deac93af9af0ce#code)).  I probably won't be devoting much more time to it, but I thought it was cathartic to get something out there.\n\nIf anyone wants to experiment with it, I have some test vectors that I published on pastebin ([link](https://pastebin.com/DTXqJGyy)).\n\nI also wrote a small, albeit incredibly dirty and undocumented, python script to help generate CT range proofs ([link](https://pastebin.com/MS0ErYGW)).  One may or may not find that useful.\n\nOverall the gas is not the greatest, but it is workable.  I sent a CT which proved two Pedersen Commitments of 3-bits (base4) a power of 17 and an offset of 0 wei.  These each covered a number in the range from 0.0 to 6.4 ETH in 0.1ETH increments.  I also then withdrew one of the new CT outputs for 0.2ETH (thus revealing what it was).  This took about 2,000,000 gas, plus another 100,000 for the final withdraw.\n\nI apologize in advance for the rough spots in the contract and the documentation.

7md3l8,1514352538,Question regarding smart contract &amp; mining interaction,"Hi everyone. I've been trading Ethereum since its inception but have really only recently started to look in to the tech (funny, seems appropriate for the crypto industry) anyway, I had a few questions that I can't seem to answer myself.\n\nWhen looking at the creation steps for a simple smart contract, I see that the output from the console is something like 'Contract Mined! Address: XYZ' which confuses me a bit. \n\n&gt;How do miners and smart contracts work together, if at all? Do the miners power the computations behind the contract, or am I missing something?\n\nIf this is *NOT* the case, then can someone explain how the following hypothetical contract would function? \n\n&gt;Contract requests a specific number to provide an output --&gt; something (miner? user? who?) is initialized to solve the algorithm that produces the number --&gt; algorithm solved, output validated --&gt; when contract is valid send 1 ETH to [address]\n\nIn short, I guess my question is: do miners and smart contracts have any link? Any reference to one another for any reason? Also, what prevents the contract, in that situation, from sending out the ETH to the address if the contract has a balance of 0? Anything?\n\nForgive me if they're simple questions, but I can't seem to find a clear cut answer in the documentation (though I'm sure it's there, I've only started skimming so far but working through it)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7md3l8/question_regarding_smart_contract_mining/,4,6

7mdblu,1514355452,I Made My First Decentralized Webpage On SWARM -- Ethereum Is For Real,"I know everyone is crazy wealthy now with the boom, but I'd like to remind everyone what it is about. I spent today educating myself on on SWARM, a project I had loosely followed, but put off getting into since it was only super-alpha on Ropsten, and I had other things in life to worry about. I feel like it is a good time to talk about the good and the could be improved from a newcomer's perspective on the process of actually using ethereum for business. \n\nIt took me about 12 hours of grinding with basic bash knowledge, good QA/UX ability, and a decent amount of experience minding dozens of wordpress installations from injection attacks as an admin for my friend's local businesses, to get it all set up. Thanks very much to the fine community members on the SWARM gitter for helping me out. I really appreciated it. Some things are very hard right now without the patience and support of existing contributors.\n\n**Now for the could be improved:**\n\nLike many of the ethereum projects going on, the core devs are stretched thin, and those capable of submitting useful PRs also have their hands full. Documentation on the ENS, SWARM, and many other projects has gone a bit stale, and getting started is quite daunting even going precisely by the documentation. \n\nI'm disappointed a bit in the Mist project, as it seems to be bloatware that doesn't do any one thing particularly well. MetaMask has really come alive, but unfortunately there is no hardware wallet support. Parity, the same. It was quite annoying to have geth interfere with MEW with a broken Trezor support on OSX. I really hope that HW wallet support is very soon expanded beyond just MEW. It's absolutely vital for developers to be able to transact on the command line and do many operations in batch. I certainly will never keep an ENS property anywhere but a battle tested HW wallet.\n\nThings are still quite unsafe and hard to manage for an average crypto punter in ethereum, but don't get me wrong, this is 100% the future of our world. Successfully submitting my first file to SWARM made me think of my days dialing up to BBS' and getting booted from CompuServe/AOL when a mate called me wanting to socialize and play sports outside. SWARM is not perfect now. The testnet is a royal PITA now, and it's easier just to fire real ether from the get go to learn. However, it's for real. It's coming. It's going to happen, and we need to support it. \n\n**Now for the good:**\n\nYou have people of all politics, and dozens of nationalities all working together to make sure the government and religious cults don't wreck the very good life most of us enjoy. It might be an extreme minority opinion on reddit, but I don't like net neutrality. I think Comcast should be able to force the worst service in the world on people, censor their content, and hijack their DNS. I think it's good. I love Ajit Pai in fact. I think this is what it must take to light a fire under everyone to protect freedom of speech, build up censorship resistant networks, and an immutable chain of data that makes international commerce efficient. We need competition in the race for decentralization. It is the best chance we have to do our best in protecting our future freedom.\n\nEthereum is not a scam. Swarm, and my favorite project, the ENS, have been completely overlooked in this recent tulpomania. This is the backbone of Ethereum. It is our future. We will make our own destiny to live free, but people have to participate. My New Year's resolution is to contribute tutorials and content so more people start using SWARM/ENS/DomainSale/MetaMask/Geth/Mist/Oraclize. The core developers are wizards. It's mind-boggling to see them chat publicly, with full accountability, and to casually discuss the future of our world. We all have a voice to make this happen, and to help them. Democracy works extremely well at this size. The more effort we put in, the longer it will last.\n\nIn the New Year I'm also moving with my wife back from the US to Lithuania to participate in blockchain related projects in a small democratic country that functions a lot like the ethereum community. The irony of this is that I strongly support Donald Trump. Of all of the far left *friends* of mine who spewed hatred towards me over the last two years, just for having rather centrist views on immigration, and being a bit contrarian -- not one of them left the US for Canada or Europe. Not one of them acted on their supposed morals. My personal morals of freedom of speech, stability for my family, and the pursuit of happiness come first for me. Plans and expectations can often act as blinders that prevent you from seeing better options. Crypto is the opportunity we all have, and I'll be damned if I let crony corporatism get in the way of this innovation. A symmetrical 100Mbps connection can be had for ~$15 a month in Vilnius. Hope to meet some of you there.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAnd if anyone cares, here is the site: http://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/latvija.eth/\n\n(Total fake news.)\n\nEdit: Site should be up. I shut my laptop down last night and things were being served, but some people reported issues accessing it. This is going to be common for the next few months. Once people are financially incentivized to build clusters for storage, things will be ready for production. SWARM should be seen as a fallback to DNS for a while, not the primary service.
