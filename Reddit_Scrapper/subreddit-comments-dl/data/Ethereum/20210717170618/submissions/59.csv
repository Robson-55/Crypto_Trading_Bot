7f9xjl,1511553562,EVM question: Static vs. Dynamic Arrays,"I have background in Python so I have very little experience with memory management expect for little bit of C few years ago.\n\nSo my question is, what things should be considered when making decision between static length and dynamic length arrays. Is there a gas cost calculator or good EVM specific learning resources available somewhere? Google search didn't bring anything up.\n\nLets consider the following example. I build a smart contract to which parents can store basic details about their children.\n\n    struct Child = {\n        string firstName;\n        uint yearOfBirth;\n    }\n\nThese structs are added to an array under their parents. Probably for most of the cases there will be one to three children, but there is always someone who has around ten. Would it be in case like this more gas efficient to just use dynamic arrays or would it be wiser to use ""overkill"" static array. For example length of 16 which should cover 99.9% of the cases but would be mostly empty space in majority of cases.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7f9xjl/evm_question_static_vs_dynamic_arrays/,28,3
