7q447x,1515845062,Cheapest way out of coinbase,"Hi guys. Coinbase won't verify my 'photo ID' after already verifying my drivers licence.

7q448s,1515845071,Zombie Transactions,"Someone told me that [one of his transactions](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x48e46d051b8cd1ce1f4638a5da7dc4c53ebd08a6f5c5a5c20d7b1badf936a3e8) is pending for two weeks now. Not a big surprise as the tx fee is 0.5 Gwei. The interesting part is that it seems that the tx gets dropped out of the mempool (of the etherscan.io node) and then gets included again after some time with a new time stamp. I'm not sure what the strategies are regarding dropping txs out of the mempool. Could be TTL (time to live), tx fee minimum, doesn't really matter. For the following I assume a TTL strategy. \n\nThe problem I see is the possible existence of a *zombie tx*:\n\n1.	Node A and node B know of tx T\n2.	T has exceeded its TTL according to A's configuration\n3.	Node A drops tx T\n4.	Node A and B sync\n5.	Node A sees a new tx T and includes it in its pool of pending tx\n6.	Node B drops tx T as it exceeds B's TTL\n7.	Node A and B sync again\n8.	Node B includes the new tx T into its mempool\n\nAlthough tx T got killed by node A and node B, it resurrects again and again. If the existence of zombie txs are possible I see the **danger of mempool spamming**. \n\nIs my guess true?\n\nIf yes, nodes should store the hash of the last X dropped transactions so they don't include them again when syncing.\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nEdit2: you can watch the phenomenon if you open the [tx on etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x48e46d051b8cd1ce1f4638a5da7dc4c53ebd08a6f5c5a5c20d7b1badf936a3e8) in a tab, let it sit there for an hour, and then open the link again in another tab. When you compare the timestamps of the same tx in both tabs you see different timestamps. Note that the tx disappears regularly, so if etherscan cannot find the tx, try again in some minutes.

One thing that was really making me cringe and writing this PSA was that it forced me to enter my seed words (even in order) after the account creation.\n\nIn android the on-screen keyboard is just another program outside the context of your app (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/creating-input-method.html) - you can even install 3rd party keyboards. These keyboards can easily detect the input of seed-words and send them home (theirs) to empty your account later.\n\nA solution for the cipher-browser can be to use 24 seed words and ask for them in random order.
