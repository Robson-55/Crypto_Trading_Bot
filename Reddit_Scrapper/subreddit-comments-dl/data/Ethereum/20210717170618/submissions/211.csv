7ojuhz,1515252790,"KryptoWar, what we learned from our first 24 hours alive","# KryptoWar ([Link](https://kryptowar.com)) - What I learned from our first 24 hours alive.\n(For those who don't know about KryptoWar, it's a war game based entirely on the Ethereum Blockchain. More details [here](https://kryptowar.com).\n---\n###### The community is big but the Metamask adoption is small\nThe Ethereum community is an incredible community (especially on Reddit) but the Metamask adoption is still small. We communicate with the Ethereum blockchain using [Web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/), the Ethereum Javascript API it's a very strong API but it requires users to own some specific plugins or apps. Our favorite plugin to use Web3.js is [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). It's an incredible tool that can let users communicate with the blockchain (to validate transactions for example) directly on the website. Unfortunately, only 34% of our users during the first 24h where using Metamask. We [updated our home page](https://kryptowar.com/) to give more details about how to use this great tool.\n\n###### Users with Metamask are very active\nWhile a lot of our users weren't using Metamask (and KryptoWar since it requires Metamask) those who were were incredibly active. Our smart contract registered almost 300 transactions in the first 24h and we had more than 60 battles between armies. \n\n###### It's way faster than I thought it would be\nKryptoWar is 100% decentralized, which means that all of the data we use to run the game are stored on the Blockchain (we don't have any database). It's way faster than I thought it would to receive data. It's of course still longer to receive data from the blockchain than from a simple mySQL database but it's fast enough to run real applications on top of it.\n\n###### Gas necessary to write on the Blockchain is expensive\nWhile the gas needed for transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain is very acceptable (less than $1 for a simple transaction) it's completely different when you want to write data or do some calculations with a smart contract. For those who don't know, it's free to **receive** data from the blockchain using Web3.js but users have to pay gas when they want/need to **write** data on the blockchain. For example, we don't charge users to battle with each others but they still have to pay for some gas to write the battle's result on the blockchain. And this was more expensive than I thought it would be (around $5-$9 for a simple battle). The fact that there were a lot of transactions yesterday didn't help and we could certainly optimize our smart contract a bit more to reduce this.\n\n###### The technology is very **VERY** impressive\nAs I explained in my first post, [KryptoWar](https://kryptowar.com) is my first Ethereum/Solidity project. I am very impressed by the technology and the tools at our disposal to communicate with the blockchain (like Metamask or Web3.js). For the first time of my life I was able to create a website and save data without creating a centralized database. Gas is certainly too expensive to create massive web applications based entirely on the blockchain (especially when users have to pay everytime they want to write data on the Blockchain) but I have no doubt that we will get there at some point, decentralization is the future.\n\n---\n###### Recent updates published since we launched\n- We updated our home page to explain to users without Metamask how to use this great tool\n- We now highlight the best armies with medals [here](https://kryptowar.com/armies/)\n- We are working on a notification system to let you know if armies attacked you while you weren't looking\n\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ojuhz/kryptowar_what_we_learned_from_our_first_24_hours/,86,32

7ojzyk,1515254427,Automated Supply Chain,"I wrote this ~4 years ago, then heard China is doing blockchain supplychain stuff recently and found my old notes.\n\nI had only a vague idea of smart contracts back then. I think this kind of technology will happen in the future: Automated inventory checking &amp; ordering, driverless delivery, robots scanning barcodes, opening packages then uploading a video to a network -- human/robot Verifiers confirm ""yes, that is the part you ordered"" (get paid a little to confirm), then smart-contract Escrow is released to the Seller + Courier.\n\nI'll paste it here for your discussion pleasure.\n\nSCHAIN: Trustable Automatable SupplyChain Network Design 0.0\n\nSUPPLYCHAIN. The problem of Supply &amp; Demand matching has been with us since the earliest economies. In the age of online storefronts numerous suppliers offer their products to specific markets. In the consumer markets we see Zappos for Shoes, Tindie for custom electronics, LowBlueLights for their namesake, HumaWorm for parasite cleanses. In industrial markets we have sites like MetalsDepot, FoamOnline, TempGenius for temperature monitoring and thousands of others.\n\nGo to any of these online stores and you'll find as a Consumer you can register an account, browse products, place an order and wait for a delivery. The ""wheel"" of placing a buy order and receiving a product delivered has been wastefully reinvented thousands of times.\n\nLong distance shipping costs are often incurred by either the Consumer or the Supplier. While gaining us much efficiency, inefficiences arise from centralized distribution systems especially when an intra-city order leaves the city to visit a distribution center then gets shipped back.\n\nReputation of a niche market seller can be difficult to verify from the Consumer's point of view, especially when the only reviews exist on the seller's website.\n\nMore flaws exist in our modern internet, often overlooked in day-to-day business but which has become increasingly apparent as cybercriminals fight for higher stakes. DDoS attacks can freeze an online business' orderflow and plummet consumer trust as they realize ""something's wrong with their website"". Security vulnerabilities in modern websites, credit card handling &amp; browser infrastructure have given a sharp boost to theft-over-ip. \n\nINCONSISTENT SCATTERED INFRASTRUCTURE HAS NO ROOM FOR IMPROVED OPERATIONS FUELED BY BIG DATA ANALYSIS.\n\nThe time has come to craft better infrastructure that protects buyers &amp; sellers from fraud while maximizing Supply Chain reliability.\n\n*Solution*\n\nWe at FutureDistributions want to build a tool which increases trust &amp; confidence in every transaction and offers big data for analysis to improve operation efficiency by automating intrinsic inefficiencies in our world's current way of running Supply Chains. We hope these developments will free human potential for more possibilities.\n\n!!\nTrustable: Records of cryptographic signatures for each step in the Supply Chain process to minimize Fraud.\nAutomatable: Using an electronic system allows for automating technologies to integrate with SCHAIN. eg. robot cars, pallet unloaders, inventory management systems.\nConsistent: By agreeing on a consistent protocol, hardware &amp; software can be developed across industries without having to reinvent the wheel for each reseller or industry.\nDATA ANALYSIS IMPROVED OPERATIONS\n!!\n\nWe hope the potential impact will become apparent as you read this short whitepaper. Known weaknesses are discussed and we have no misconceptions to think this is a perfect solution. There are doubtless many more flaws than what we &amp; our advisors were able to list in addition to the serious problem of transforming an entrenched business pattern. Nonetheless, we must take this step forward if for no other reason than to begin a conversation in the first step of our journey to improve life on this planet.\n\n**CORE CONCEPTS**\n\nSCHAIN depends on 5 major Actors: Supplier, Courier, Handler, Accessor and Needer who arrange transactions across the Intermediary of a network protocol.\n\nThe relevant Actor publishes a crytographically signed verification of each step in the SCHAIN process to validate buy &amp; sell intent, item retrieval by the courier, item delivery &amp; payment confirmation in a specified cryptocurrency.\n\nNeeders &amp; Suppliers are the core buyers &amp; sellers. In their BuyOrders and SellOrders they specify IdentitySelections for other members of their transaction.\n\n*IdentitySelection*\n\nAn IdentitySelection specifies which entities can be a specific Actor in a transaction. SCHAIN V0 specifies only two simple options for IdentitySelection:\n\n(**Footnote: what is a public key why useful?)\n\n!!\nSpecific Public Keys: A set of specific public keys. Example: A Needer wanting 10 Gallons of soy-based packing foam might specify the public key of a FoamOnline entity identity.\n\nSet of Public Keys Voting: A set of specific public keys which are asked to vote. In V0, we recommend this be limited to 1.\n!!\n\nFootnote: *see Appendix: Identity Selection\n\nBy Default, our recommended standard is for a a Needer (Buyer) can specify in their BuyOrder a specific Supplier and specify the Accessor &amp; Courier as a PublicKeyVoting with only the identity of the Supplier in the set of public keys. This lets the Buyer explicitly grant permission to the Supplier to choose who removes items from the Supplier's inventory &amp; who delivers the items. \n\n!!\nAdd sequence diagram\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN LINK SEQUENCE\n____________\nTHE NEED: A buyer posts a Need to their SCHAIN Network. The Need specifies:\n  -- What kind of item and how they want it to be delivered. \n  -- An escrowed transaction to the Supplier\n  -- A Validation requirement for the conditions of that Escrow to be paid.\n  -- Which entity will receive the items from the Courier (the Handler)\n\nNOTE: The escrow payment COULD BE FROM A NEW ENTITY. The Needer could have contacted an independent party to pay for the item. For example, in a crowdfunded purchase of a new coffee grinder for a coffee shop.\n\nTHE MATCH: The Supplier of the posted Need accepts the Need. They post the next link in the sequence which cryptographically signs their identity and intention to match the Need. This link additionally specifies:\n -- Which entity will Access the Item from which location\n -- Which entity will Courier the Item \n -- An escrow payment to the Courier\n -- A Validation for the escrow to be paid when the Handler receives the delivered Item\n\n\nTHE APPROVAL: With the Match posted, the Needer has the opportunity to Approve or Reject the matched bid. They simply post an Approval link, specifying:\n -- The timestamp of Approval\n -- Confirming the Match with a signed hash of the Match\n\nTHE ACCESS: With the Need matched by the Supplier, an Accessor collects the Item from the Supplier and delivers to the Courier. This will likely be an agent of the Supplier onsite at their warehouse. This link will trigger the payment of an escrow from the Supplier to Accessor, if applicable. The Accessor's link specifies:\n -- Item accessed from the Supplier and now in Accessor's possesion, including a tracking number or barcode for the Supplier and/or Needer to monitor.\n\nTHE DELIVERY: The Courier fills in the next link, broadcasting to the network:\n --A signature of the Access link indicating the item is received and they are en route to the Handler specified in the Need link.\n --Any optional notes the Courier wishes to publicise to indicate a damaged item, bad weather conditions, etc.\n\nTHE RECEIPT: As the Courier delivers the item to the Handler, the Handler announces receipt of delivery, specifying a timestamp of receipt. This triggers approval for the escrowed payment from the Needer to the Supplier to fulfill.\n --The item is delivered. The SCHAIN circuit is complete!\n\n----------------\n\nNOTE: Escrow: An Escrow should function as a network-verifiable contract. If the network verifies the Validation requirements are met, then the network will verify the Escrow transaction reaches its specified recipient.\n\nNOTE: each step is chained to the previous by their specification\nFor emphasis: each Actor cryptographicallly signs their interaction with another Actor at each point in the process. Every Actor can monitor the SCHAIN to track progress of a transaction.\n\n*Footnote: (It is outside of SCHAIN's scope &amp; up to the Supplier to account for inventory management.)\n!!\n\nNOTE: Verification occurs with private keys. Verification CAN be automated with a specified Verification Network eg. Supplier automates ACCESS granted to ACCESSOR via VERIFICATION NETWORK, REQUEST, RESOLUTION: true ((SEE APPENDIX FOR DETAILS))\n\n!!\n\nTraditionally the identity of an Accessor (who removes items from an inventory) will belong to the Supplier. However, outsourcing or renting of automated Accessors could mean a forklift operator belongs to a different entity than the warehouse).\n\nDefault: Our recommended standard is for a Needer to specify their own Handlers &amp; specify the Supplier's choice (a vote of 1) for Accessor.\n\n\nAutomation:\n* (All of these Actors can be operated by automatic machines. However, given the possibility of fraud leaving all aspects to machines, we recommend the use of a Video Verification system [ref] for deliveries between the Courier &amp; Handler. A short video of the transaction and the goods would be published to a Video Verification network. Members of that network would cast a vote on if the delivery looks right. If the vote succeeds then the Handler signs receipt of the goods, Courier releases the goods and Payment issues from Needer to Supplier and from whomevers specified to Courier, Accessor and Handler.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ojzyk/automated_supply_chain/,1,3

If my understanding is correct, backing up to the blockchain would be more secure than uploading to a centralized server.\n\nAdditionally, the 'gas' would probably be comparable to the traditional fees of lets say Dropbox or iCloud. I understand backups probable couldn't be made on a continuous basis, but I feel like a monthly backup would be very valuable and would be interested in a blockchain-based alternative to traditional cloud services.\n\nAdditionally, could blockchain technology be used for 'backups of the backup', lets say if iCloud wants to create a backup of all its data, I image a decentralized approach would make sense.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ok3o6/ethereum_as_a_backup_or_cloud_alternative/,10,10

7okotj,1515261136,Parity Noob Questions,"I hope this is the right place to ask this stuff. I haven't been able to find any answers to the few questions I have. Thanks in advance!\n\nI'm new to using Parity, as I'd like to take advantage of my Nano S. I understand that I could use a site like Radar Relay (that doesn't natively support the Nano) with Parity and be able to use the Nano.\n\nSo, first, here's what I'd like to achieve:\n\n1. Run a local Parity node in one spot on my LAN. I don't want a Parity instance on every computer I use.\n2. Connect to that node from multiple ""clients"" on my LAN (a few different laptops / desktops).\n3. Connect my Nano S to the box I'm using at the time (whether it be a laptop, desktop, etc...), NOT the server that Parity is actually running on. I've read little parts here and there that seem to elude that it is possible, but I haven't been able to get it working. \n\nOne main issue I'm having is that Parity keeps crashing during synchronization.\n\nI'm running the latest Stable Release downloaded from their GitHub (1.7.11). I've read somewhere that if I want to be able to connect to a Parity instance from any other computer other than the one I'm running on, I should start it up with --public-node switch. The current instance I'm running I started like this:\n\nparity.exe --public-node --warp\n\nI'm running it on Win10x64 with all updates. Currently waiting on this instance to finish syncing. I still cannot connect to the Parity instance from another machine on my LAN, when I go to :8180 I get a ""refused to connect error"".\n\nI've also installed the Parity Chrome extension, because I've read this is what allows websites to interact with the Parity instance. I haven't been able to get this working. It always says, ""You are not connected to a local Parity node"" even when I run it on the same machine as where Parity is running, and the address in options is pointing to 127.0.0.1:8180 I was thinking that maybe Parity has to be fully sync'd before the extension will work? (I have not been able yet to get fully sync'd... hopefully this time)\n\nSo, a few questions:\n\n1. Is my desired setup possible?\n2. Can the Parity Chrome extension connect to a ""Public Node"" instance of Parity running on a different box on my LAN? If so, will this allow me to ""tunnel"" my locally connected Nano to the Parity instance running on the server?\n3. Where are the ""account"" files stored when you connect to a Public node / make an account? I don't want to have to go through the whole, ""make a new ethereum address / backup phrase"" part every time I connect to my Public node.\n4. Is there a way to 'cancel out of' that ""make a new ethereum address / backup phrase"" part and just go to the Parity home screen and import your own account?\n5. Warp sync finished in under 5 min, but now I have from blocks 4,480,109 to the current block to fully sync. Is this normal?\n6. Am I only able to connect to a Public node from a different machine once that node fully syncs? I don't have a firewall running on the server, and still I cannot connect.\n\nI think that's my questions for now. Thanks again everyone.\n\n** Edit: If I find answers to this, I'd happily write a guide for others with the same questions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7okotj/parity_noob_questions/,5,2

7oksxt,1515262193,Ethereum use case idea: Support brick &amp; mortar small businesses on a local level.,"Hi All,\n\nA buddy and I have been thinking about this idea for a while, so I though I'd share, and see what the community thinks, and if there's something similar already out there / in the making. \n\nThe idea is simple. Basically the same mechanism as ICO-s, but instead of online ""Startups"", this platform would make it possible for anyone to invest in brick&amp; mortar small businesses locally. \n\nExample: \n\nYour favorite local coffeeshop wants to renovate their space / open up another branch, etc. So they launch their own token, that anyone can buy, and serves as stocks basically (again, like ICO-s). \n\nThey'll get their funding from their regulars (or any entrepreneurial folks who see the potential in the business), and from then on, people who own some of their coins, get perks (dividends, discounts, subscription plans, voting rights for seasonal items, etc). \n\nSo it's basically Kickstarter meets ICO-s meets brick &amp; mortar/small business world. \n\nThe actual product would be a website, where you can browse through the businesses in your area and see which ones you'd like to invest in (and a hub for the small businesses to promote their projects)\n\nThe idea is very basic at this point, but was curious to see what you guys think. \n\nAny notes, feedback, thoughts would be greatly appreciated. \n\nHave a great day!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7oksxt/ethereum_use_case_idea_support_brick_mortar_small/,3,8
