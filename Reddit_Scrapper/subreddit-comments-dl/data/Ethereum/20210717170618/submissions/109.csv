Even if I leave it overnight to solve its downloads, I still cannot ever seem to get to a 100% sync. It always gets stuck at perhaps a few hundred blocks away and then starts downloading chainstructure forever. \n\n\n\nI currently have my wallet on a password encrypted external SSD, but would like to use it soon to transfer ETH from Bitstamp to Binance (heard there were some issues with internal transfers etc.). The eth is in my wallet address, but I just can't seem to be able to make my MIST sync up...\n\n\nWould like to add that my PC is not the best. I got it for free at school. It's a DELL. Laptop. Yeah.
