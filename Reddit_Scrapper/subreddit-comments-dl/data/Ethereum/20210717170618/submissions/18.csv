7bjss8,1510125760,Proposing The Ethereum Policy Conference,"I have watched and read about with awe and high respect both the recent Devcon3 and Scaling Bitcoin conferences. It is amazing to see the presentations about highly technical issues, new technologies and proposals for scaling and security of blockchains from such respected experts.\n\nFollowing the example of those conferences I would like to propose the ""Ethereum Policy Conference"". I think this conference could include not only scientists and engineers like in the other conferences, but also legal, economic, game theory and non-technical blockchain experts. \n\nThe goal would be, rather than focusing on technical issues, to focus on basic principles and policies to follow as a guidance for the community in general. It is not to set rules or laws, but only to gain a deeper understanding, through experts and research, of these issues which are normally left only to social media and sometimes bitter and endless debates.\n\nAs always, the policies and changes may be adopted or not and would be subject to rough consensus which is the way in which blockchains evolve. \n\nAn example of some of the continuously debated topics that could be explored in a specialized, live streamed conference with experts are:\n\n- Immutability: What is it, what is its extent, when does it apply and when not? Why is it good or bad, what are the benefits and risks?\n- Permissionlessness (same)\n- Censorship resistance...\n- Social Scalability... \n- The tradeoff between security and faster innovation...\n- What are the overarching goals of a blockchain? e.g. property, agreements, etc.\n- Monetary policies: What is the difference between flexible supply and fixed supply, who decides? When is it good or bad as a store of value, exchange, retail payments, high value settlements, etc.?\n- Trusted third parties: What are they, what is their risk, why do we want to decentralize them, etc.etc.\n\nMany more topics and subject experts could be included.\n\nAlthough there may be a lot of ideology in the above topics (I divide them between conservatives and progressives!) I think that to have experts talk about a mix of legal, technical, social, economic and policy issues would be a great way of deepening our knowledge and advancing blockchain governance and perhaps the institutions of the future.\n\nI don't know exactly how Scaling Bitcoin works, but I think that a committee or group to organize the above proposed conference could work in a similar independent way.\n\nThoughts?\n\n**EDIT: Again, it's NOT to actually set policies or establish laws or rules, it's only to explore issues that are normally not subjects of the mainstream conferences.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bjss8/proposing_the_ethereum_policy_conference/,27,7
