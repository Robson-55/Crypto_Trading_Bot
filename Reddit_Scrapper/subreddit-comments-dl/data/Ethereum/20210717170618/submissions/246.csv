I have managed to install MetaMask and send some ETH to it. I am now trying to send an ETH transaction to invest in an ICO.\n\nI checked ethgasstation and saw that I should use a 42gas for my tx to go fast, so that's what I did, with a 200'000 gas limit. edit: just sent it again with 70 gas, didn't change anything for now. edit: now with 121.. and I am downvoted to 0 with no answer, is this the ""great ethereum community"" I heard about ??\n\nAs I understand it this should be really fast ?\n\nProblem is, it is still not showing up on etherscan:\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xa3b5aacef0528a091668259f3e10a3fbe9b04b10d79a79510a4fda9d58ed983a\n\nThis is what I see on Metamask : https://imgur.com/nloJSPA\n\nI already tried to backup my seed, lock metamask, then restart it from seed.\n\nHope you can help me, thanks !",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7qep7a/please_help_a_noob_send_his_first_eth_transaction/,7,10

What are your shared values/principles?,"\n It's still early enough in the development of this technology and community that we can decide as a group what some of our shared principles/values are. This post is just a conversation starter for this subject, because I haven't seen the issue addressed very broadly that often.\n\nI'll get the ball rolling with a few casual observations I've seen over the year or two here. But in the spirit of decentralization, I offer the topic up to community comment.\n\nTrue Decentralization \n\nrevolutionary accessibility\n\nvisionary innovation and collaboration\n\nCivic responsibility - This one I'm borrowing from somewhere else, but I've seen it in this community several times.\n\nIf Ethereum truly is the backbone of world changing technology, what do we want this new world to look like? Like the old adage goes: We reap what we sow, so what kind of seeds will we plant for our shared future?\n\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7qeps4/ethereum_community_do_you_know_yourself_what_are/,27,14
