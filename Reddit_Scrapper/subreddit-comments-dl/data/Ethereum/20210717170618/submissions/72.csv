7g8p5l,1511912995,How should block rewards be apportioned under Casper FFG?,"The introduction of Casper FFG ('hybrid PoW/PoS') will complicate the security model for Ethereum. Rather than just compensating miners or 'PoW validators"", the network will also need to compensate stakers or 'PoS validators'.\n\nThe two types of validator are effectively providing different types of security. PoW validators reach consensus on each block, while the possibility of chain reorganisations remains; meanwhile PoS validators reach consensus only every 50th block, but they do so with finality.\n\nIt doesn't seem obvious to me how the block reward should be divided between these two groups.

7g91pc,1511916049,Is Lack of Transaction Anonymity a Barrier to Widespread Adoption?,"I've been thinking more about this recently. If I send a friend X ETH they can see exactly how much money I have. This isn't a concern for me personally because my friends who have ETH already know how much ETH I have, but I can see it presenting a security and privacy risk for day-to-day transactions (I'm sure businessmen would prefer their barista doesn't know how wealthy they are to the dime).\n\nNow, I've heard that Ethereum will be implementing zk-snarks from Zcash as an anonymity/privacy feature, but this still seems suboptimal to me. A coin like Monero for example is fully anonymous, because anonymous transactions are the default. In a mixed public and anonymous transaction context, it seems you will never have total anonymity. This is because one past transaction that can be traced back to you will identify you. So for example if I use zk-snarks to send an anonymous transaction, but you can trace the totality of the rest of my blockchain history, you can calculate exactly how much I sent in that transaction. \n\nThis public/private blockchain issue also raises the risk that your transaction will be suspected of being fraudulent if the standard is public transactions and you choose to make an anonymous transaction.\n\nJust wanted to hear any insights from people who might be more familiar with privacy/anonymity on the blockchain, to tell me what I'm missing or if it's the case that ETH is the best smart contract platform at the moment but won't truly be able to achieve privacy anytime soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7g91pc/is_lack_of_transaction_anonymity_a_barrier_to/,19,11

In a centralized world, the creator of the application makes money from being the middle man, taking money from each hand or bet to act as the secured middle man.   If I modeled this as a dApp, the users itself act as the authority, and the advantage would be less 'rake' or 'fees' for the end user.  However, this is a large task to build - how is the creator of a decentralized app rewarded for their efforts, since the hassle of building something is mostly rewarded in a sense by 'middleman fees'.

How do we think we will handle this?\n\nLet's say Zillow figures out a way to automate a lot of the real estate market.  Find the house, put the down payment in escrow, inspection, all that is handled via smart contracts.  Including the deed that sits out there until payment is made in full.  Let's say a hacker finds out how to do something bad with this.  Do we fork?  If so, what about all the other thousands of companies that are on the chain by this time (fingers crossed)?\n\n\nHow will we handle all of this at scale?\n\nIs it fair to expect these companies to ""deal with it, we're immutable!""?  I don't think that's the right approach if we're expecting this to be a global platform.\n\n\nI am of the opinion that I believe in the tech and the team.  They are building something amazing.  I honestly feel if we want this thing to be a global platform we need to be okay with forking as needed to combat malicious behavior.  If that is the case...how do we handle this at scale?  If thousands of companies are on this platform and people need a fork every other week....that's not realistic.  I get the fact that they need to audit the hell out of their code, but I am a firm believer where there's a will there's a way.\n\n\nThoughts?\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ga5f9/what_if_a_hard_fork_discussion/,3,3
