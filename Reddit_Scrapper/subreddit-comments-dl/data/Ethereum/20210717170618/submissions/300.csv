7u6fcl,1517364819,Smart Contract Idea/Help,"I had an idea for a smart contract that would allow you to store your coins for some period of time, at which point it would allow another address to withdraw them. \n\nThe idea was that I could keep my coins there, and if I die, my trustee would be able to access my tokens, since I do not share my private keys or any way to access my wallet with anyone.\n\nYou would be able to update the time, so you could use the contract indefinitely.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI wrote a simple contract that I believe accomplishes this here: https://github.com/rjv4/EthereumLockbox/blob/master/src/Lockbox.sol\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCan anyone here give me some feedback on this, or point me to a better place to discuss this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7u6fcl/smart_contract_ideahelp/,3,9

7u6pw7,1517367499,Noob question PoW vs PoS,"Sorry if I am beating a dead horse here but I am a bit green to “ the crypto”. \n\nBeen trying to wrap my head around PoW vs PoS and I just can’t sum up the end game for PoS. I have many questions but I’ll start with a basic one. \n\nMaybe someone can explain it to me. \n\nIf we assume that a coin will be around for a long time, all roads seem to lead to centralization. \n\nEventually the people with the most coins will have even more coins and so be in charge. \n\nAll a bank has to do to gain control is buy 51% of a currency and that’s about it. There is now way to regain control short of making new coins or doing hard fork I suppose. \n\nAm I missing something here with PoS?

7u76bm,1517371608,Can a token issuer take back a customer ERC20 once delivered to a wallet?,"Hi,  I am wondering if it is possible for a token issuer, say an ICO to take back a custom ERC20 coin that they have already sent to someone's wallet?  For instance, an ICO sends out their new token to my private ETH wallet.  On Etherscan it shows that I hold X amount of that token.  Once it's in my wallet, there is no way to essentially remove that coin from my personal ETH wallet unless I were the one to send it correct?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7u76bm/can_a_token_issuer_take_back_a_customer_erc20/,1,14
7u76e1,1517371629,GOLDX by HelloGold (HGT) is now available and set to replace Tether as a viable stablecoin,"HelloGold Foundation (issuer of HelloGold Token with symbol HGT and listed on COSS.io/HitBTC/GateCoin) has announced that it has launched GOLDX, the world's first audited gold backed token, to provide an anchor of stability to sophisticated crypto investors.\n\nGOLDX is a fully operational ERC20 token backed by 99.99% investment-grade gold independently vaulted in Singapore. The smart contract was audited by ZK Labs and ChainSecurity while the gold is audited by Bureau Veritas and insured by XL Group. Operations backing the gold are based on best practices from SPDR GLD, the world's largest gold ETF.\n\nPurchased using Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), the main purpose of GOLDX is to provide cryptocurrency investors with quick and liquid access to physical gold as an investment class. GOLDX can be purchased within minutes and as an ERC20 token is transferable between Ethereum wallets.\n\nGOLDX is designed to play an important role in a cryptocurrency portfolio, whether as an option for asset diversification or as an alternative to converting cryptocurrencies into fiat currency. With daily volumes of USD 250 billion compared to USD 2 billion in cryptocurrencies, gold provides stability to a volatile market.\n\nThe USD 500 billion cryptocurrency market has been searching for a viable stablecoin - a cryptocurrency whose price is stable - that is both liquid and shows reserves transparently. GOLDX provides both.\n\nRobin Lee, CEO of HelloGold, commented in a recent interview on CNBC: ""GOLDX is an alternative to a USD hedge."" Mr Lee, who was also the Principal Accounting Officer of SPDR GLD, added, ""GOLDX is taking gold into the cryptocurrency space by applying best practices from running SPDR GLD to create an arguably more trustworthy technical product. It's the perfect stablecoin for sophisticated crypto investors who are looking to hedge their funds.""\n\nGOLDX is available for sale over the counter with a minimum purchase amount of 100 GOLDX. Customers can begin the purchase process or find out more information about GOLDX and the HelloGold Foundation at hellogold.org.\n\nOther than direct purchase at hellogold.org, alternative ways to receive GOLDX include: 1) Receive as a reward for HGT holders by the HelloGold Foundation. Action-to-take : BUY HGT on COSS.io, HitBTC or GateCoin; and 2) Wait for GOLDX to be listed on Exchanges in Q3 2018.\n\nAsk more about HGT and GOLDX from the HelloGold community at t.me/hellogoldchat\n\nPress Release: markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/GOLDX-the-world-s-first-audited-gold-backed-token-is-announced-in-the-wake-of-fresh-concerns-about-the-security-of-cryptocurrencies-1014503072\n\nNews on Tether: bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-tether-said-to-get-subpoenaed-by-cftc",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7u76e1/goldx_by_hellogold_hgt_is_now_available_and_set/,8,11
