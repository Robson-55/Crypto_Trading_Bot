7j42ei,1513016530,Seedom - A charitable DAPP (that doesn't involve cat breeding),"[Seedom](http://www.seedom.io) is an Ethereum decentralized application for raising awareness and Ether for charities in need while rewarding a single participant for their contribution and support.\n\nTwice a month, we will run an “ether-raiser” (similar to a raffle) for a selected charity. The selection of charities is determined by need. For example, when net neutrality is at risk, Seedom would identify a charity that defends the greater good and helps them thrive.\n\nDuring the ether-raiser, participants can obtain entries with ether. Along with their ether, they will supply a secret random string of characters, which must be revealed before the end. A winner is selected using the combination of each participant’s revealed random value and a final random value from the charity. Obtaining un-manipulated randomness in a smart contract is difficult. However, our process is similar to that of [RANDAO](https://github.com/randao/randao) (a generally accepted way of doing randomness on the Ethereum network), with differences outlined in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/seedom-io/seedom-whitepaper/raw/master/seedom-whitepaper.pdf).\n\nThe winner will receive 35% of the pool whereby the selected charity receives the majority of the pool at 60%. The remaining 5% is reserved for the Seedom team for administration costs (server costs, marketing, legal, etc.).\n\nSeedom wants to remain as transparent and as honest as possible in our trustless community. Our [smart contract](https://github.com/seedom-io/seedom-solidity/blob/master/contract/seedom.sol) is available for scrupulous critiques. Our team members are public. We now want to engage the community and be sure that our contract is an effective use of Ethereum and free of any vulnerabilities. Everything is being made public and open source, beginning with our contract.\n\nRead our [blog post](https://medium.com/@seedom.io/5-ways-seedom-seeks-to-revolutionize-philanthropy-d18d4baa1f1b?source=linkShare-da639584b7dd-1513008537) on Medium to see the five ways we seek to revolutionize philanthropy and check out our [Bitcoin Forums post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2567808).",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7j42ei/seedom_a_charitable_dapp_that_doesnt_involve_cat/,24,3

7j51gr,1513024143,There's a simple fix for the Parity bug,"The Parity bug has rendered half a million ETH permanently inaccessible.  It's ETH that's effectively ""destroyed"" or ""deissued"".  It's ETH that has been *removed from circulation*.\n\nLet that sink in for a moment.\n\nThe proposed solutions so far are complex and may have far-reaching, and potentially dangerous consequences for Ethereum contracts and the system as a whole.\n\nThere is one simple and justifiable solution to half a million ETH having been destroyed and removed from circulation.\n\nIssue it back.  Pick a block number and an address, and issue the lost ETH (and any other tokens) into this address. At the same time, set the balances of the previously affected accounts to zero.\n\nIt's the correct solution.  The ETH in question has already been removed from supply, and by setting the balances to zero this would be formalised.  It is *not* creating ETH ""out of thin air"" to issue it back after its trapped.  It's just a simpler and significantly less-risky way to return that trapped ETH back into circulation.\n\nI don't see any problem with discussing other solutions, maybe someone will come up with a better one.  But if a solution is going to be proposed, and its more complex than this, I don't see any benefit.  Obviously the ideology of an immutable chain will have already been compromised by other solutions, so why faff about?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7j51gr/theres_a_simple_fix_for_the_parity_bug/,0,7
