7bhad2,1510098187,The solution to the multi-sig question is merely a symptom of a much larger problem: a lack of governance.,"I would like to propose that we forget about the Parity multi-sig question for a moment.  From what I understand, the loss of coins are not going to cause Parity to go out of business.  The coins are all sitting there unable to be moved around, so as a community we're under no pressure to come up with a solution in a timely manner.  We can take our time and be thorough.\n\nInstead, can we please talk about coming up with some systems for determining how we deal with problems like this which will inevitably arise again in the future?  Reddit (and other internet forums) don't seem particularly well-suited to the cause, as they can be flooded by sock-puppet accounts all parroting the same opinion.  Carbonvote has the distasteful side-effect of giving the most power to those who already wield vast amounts of wealth.  And while I'm a fan of technocracy and meritocracy, I can understand why the Foundation and its developers/researchers don't want to be the ones on the hook for proposing a solution every time something bad happens.\n\nSo, Ethereum Community, how can we better govern ourselves?  It seems to me that if we solve this problem (or, let's be realistic -- take some baby steps towards solving it) then issues like trying to determine what to do about the Parity multi-sig will become self-evident.\n\nFocusing on whether to fork or not to fork in this particular case is treating a symptom, when really we should be looking at dealing with the root cause. This way, we'll have less uncertainty over how to treat 'symptoms' when they arise in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bhad2/the_solution_to_the_multisig_question_is_merely_a/,41,28

The DAO hack stole 14% of the entire Ethereum supply at the time, comparing that to the current supply, 14% of today's would be ~$4,000,000,000 - meaning this situation is nothing like the DAO attack.\n\n2. The DAO attack put the stolen Ethereum in the hands of a malicious person, this is however not the case with parity.\n\nI feel like a lot people here are honestly scared or think Ethereum Foundation is going to make an emergency hard fork over this, but if you compare it to the DAO hack, this is absolutely nothing.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bhx0y/comparing_parity_exploit_to_the_dao_hack/,5,2
7bhx8p,1510104360,How DFINITY solve the problem of buggy smart contract code like the recent Parity issue.,"First of all, DFINITY is supposed to be a sister network to Ethereum, not a replacement or a competitor. The idea is that some contract / dapps might be best suited in an algorithmic governance platform rather than a 'code is law' style platform like Ethereum (*debatable*)\n\nIn my opinion, DFINITY's biggest selling point is the Blockchain Nervous System (BNS). On chain governance mechanism that allows for protocol upgrades (and much more) without the need to hardfork the network. This is *somewhat* similar to the idea of Tezos but DFINITY will use the EVM and solidity, so that any contract that can be deployed on Ethereum can also be deplayed on DFINITY. \n\nThose who 'stake' their coins in a 'neuron' are given voting power proportional to their stake. The BNS is the collection of all the neurons in the network. Anyone can submit a proposal to the network and those who are staking their coins can vote on the proposals. A proposal can:\n\n* freeze smart contracts / dapps\n\n     * the network might want to freeze dapps that are used for criminal activity, etc.\n\n* reverse transactions\n        \n    * In an event where a bug is discovered smart contract and millions of dollars are stolen or lost (like theDAO or Parity incident), the network can vote to return these lost funds, all without the need for a hard fork.\n\n* Edit smart contract code\n \n     * imagine a popular dapp is launched to the network, millions of people use this dapp and a bug is discovered. On the Ethereum network, there is nothing you can do to fix this dapp. All you can do is take the code, fix it and launch an entirely new smart-contract. On DFINITY, you could submit a proposal to the network, and have the bug fixed if the community votes to do so. The only way to edit a smart contract like this on the Ethereum network is to hardfork.\n\n* upgrade the protocol\n    \n    * Imagine if Bitcoin was able to absorb the features of all of the alt-coins that were created after Bitcoin. Instead of creating new currencies for Zcash, Ethereum, etc., What if Bitcoin just added features for private transactions, smart contracts, etc. There would be no need for these other currencies. This is the potential power of DFINITY, since the BSN can upgrade the protocol without the need for a hardfork. The reason Bitcoin can't do this is because 1. People cannot agree on which features to add to bitcoin and 2. It would take a hardfork to add new protocol features such as these ones mentioned. DFINITY solves these problems.\n\nBasically, the BNS has absolute power to change the network in any way. Now, this is potentially bad right? What if the BNS decides to burn somebodies coins for no reason? What if the BNS goes crazy and destroys the network? Well, the Blockchain Nervous System is made up of 'neurons'. And neurons are created by people who stake their DFINITY coins. You can only vote on proposals if you are staking your coins in a neuron and you cannot withdraw your coins from a neuron until you have waited 3 months (or longer) and you cannot vote while waiting for the withdraw. This means that everyone who votes on proposals have their own money on the line because if they vote on a proposal that hurts the network, the value of their coins will go down and they are unable to sell their coins for at least 3 months. So, everyone voting on proposals that can potentially change the network in some way are incentivized to only pass proposal that increase the value of the network and their coins.\n\nThis kind of governance model is not desired in all circumstances, but that's why it will exists along side Etheruem so the developers can choose which platform best fits the needs of their application, or the developer can launch the application on both networks and let the users choose which platform they feel safer using, an immutable platform will irreversible transactions, or a democratically governed platform by it's participants. \n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bhx8p/how_dfinity_solve_the_problem_of_buggy_smart/,7,1

7bjny5,1510123895,Monolithic contracts considered harmful,"I wanted to float an idea here that I've been thinking about for some time which is that monolithic contracts should generally be avoided in preference for smaller ones.\n\nIf we think of traditional real world contracts, they usually involve only the few counterparties involved. So, for example if one buys a house the contract involves the buyer, seller, and perhaps a handful of other parties. It is atypical for contracts to be designed such that they involve hundreds of parties although there are some exceptions.\n\nHow would such a system work? One easy way would be to have a contract generator. This need not be on chain and could easily be programmed as a web application. For example, you visit contactmakingthing.com/RealEstate, enter the addresses of the counterparties and various other parameters and wallah you have code. It could even have a nice ""push to blockchain"" button.\n\nThis sort of contract templating is commonly offered for traditional contracts as well.\n\nI admire that folks in this community think big, but decentralization is perhaps the key aspect of the entire cryptocurrency enterprise. Why disintermediate something by replacing a large centralized corporate actor with a large centralized machine actor when you could go all the way to making many contracts?\n\nIt's increasingly hard to blame human programming error for repeated large scale losses of funds in Ethereum. The usual calls for formal verification have been repeated and as I understand it efforts are already underway to build better languages than Solidity. We operate in an adversarial environment which in some sense is more difficult than writing secure bank software because source code has to be public for anyone to trust code.\n\nWhile we await the perfect idiot-proof, type-safe, functional, formal verification friendly language, please consider letting your users each have their own contract.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bjny5/monolithic_contracts_considered_harmful/,9,1
