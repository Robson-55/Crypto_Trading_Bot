7cumhg,1510653339,"Can anyone explain me what ""Contract ETH"" is?","I understand this question scratches the edge of this sub's guidelines but since it is a technical matter I'll try it anyway.  \n  \nI am holding some TaaS tokens, a fund that distributes quarterly profits via smart contracts. I hold the tokens in their online wallet so the profits (in ETH) are paid out there as well.  \n  \nNow I've send some of those ETH from there to an exchange. The transaction was successful and traceable in Etherscan, (TX Hash = 0x22379b7b763c101d090d392cde7e345ac742f66c67c1f8383e5af83a2d8359b9 ) however, the ETH never got added to my balance.  \n  \nI have contacted the exchange (no reply on ticket) and have contacted TaaS. Now TaaS told me the problem is probably that the ETH is **""Contract ETH""** and I should have send it to MyEtherWallet first and then re-send it from there.  \n  \nThis sounds a bit absurd to me, since an ETH is an ETH and cannot just disappear from the blockchain, right? Can anyone explain to me what I am missing? Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7cumhg/can_anyone_explain_me_what_contract_eth_is/,13,3
