7r7st5,1516256664,Can Ethereum be truly Decentralized?,"One big obstacle to Decentralization is the fact that Ether (Like all coins) is exchangeable with Fiat. So most of the supply of Ether can end up in the hands of a small number of fiat-rich actors, who then, de-facto, control the flow of Ether and have a huge influence on the entire Ethereum Ecosystem. \n\nWe are probably on our way to this situation, if we are not already there. And PoS will make it ""worse"", as it will reward holders of ETH with more ETH, the more you have the more you get. \n\nI am interested in hearing your ideas about this challenge.\nDoes the centralization of capital take away the edge of Etherium's decentralized nature?\nTo what extent has it already happenned? \nWhat could be possible solutions? \n\nA few ideas I thought of: \n1) A large scale distribution of Ether in a way that decentralizes the holding. \n2) Integrate mechanisms that reduce the ability of Large holders to manipulate the market/ecosystem\n3) Going a bit further - I imagine a coin that cannot be hoarded. For example a coin that expires or fades if not used.\n\nI think that in desiging today's Crypto Currencies we are still thinking very much inside the box created by Fiat and old-school capitalism.
