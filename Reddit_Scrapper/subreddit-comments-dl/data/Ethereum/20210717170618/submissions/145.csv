Currently 1 ETH can be bought for Rs. 53,500 ($825) but in binance, it's about Rs.46,000 ($720). \n\nThis insane difference leads me to get less etherium which ends up being worth less on exchanges such as binance.\n\nIs there any work around to this?

I assume I'm not getting my ether back, but I'm more interested in wtf happened here.\n\nDid the ICO's contract somehow still receive the funds? Is Coinbase cockblocking me?\n\nAppreciate any guidance on this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7km3og/question_about_failed_ether_transaction/,12,6
