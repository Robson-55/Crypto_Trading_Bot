7qqpvo,1516087827,Question about Gas Price and sending to MEW,"Hi folks,\n\nI have a question about how to interpret the Actual TX Cost as performed when sending to an Ethereum address. \n\nFor context, I have purchased a small amount of ether on Coinbase, and have been teaching myself how to create a wallet and perform a transaction. Following the instructions on MEW's page, it recommended sending a small amount (.0001) of ether to the wallet address. Unfortunately, Coinbase has a minimum withdrawal of .001 ETH. Not a huge deal, it only means I'm playing with $1.30 instead of $0.13... However, when monitoring the transaction on Etherscan, I noted that the gas price was somewhat high (52 Gwei), so, the Actual Tx Cost/Fee said 0.001092 Ether.\n\nSo, what exactly happened here? The transaction was successful, and I received the .001 ETH in my wallet, and Coinbase/GDAX only showed a deduction of .001 ETH from my account. So, where did the Actual TX cost come into play? I would have expected to pay .002092 ETH for that transaction, but it doesn't appear that it cost anything extra. Did Coinbase pay that .001092 (seems unlikely)? Does the Actual TX cost include the amount transferred (meaning the TX fees were .000092)? Even in that latter case, I don't see that fee coming out of my Coinbase account. Finally, if this was a personal transaction between my own ETH addresses, would that .001 ETH transaction really cost .002 ETH?\n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7qqpvo/question_about_gas_price_and_sending_to_mew/,2,1
