7b06z0,1509914601,Why is eth-transactions so much cheaper and faster than BTC-transactions even though there's more transactions in eth-network?,"I thought the high transaction price of BTC was mainly due to higher amounts of transactions, and some due to small block size.  \n\nBut the last few months there has been more transactions in the  ethereum-chain than in the BTC-chain: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-eth.html#1y \n \nMeanwhile ethereum transaction costs have stayed on a fraction of BTC cost. https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-eth.html#1y\n\nAt the same time ethereum have median confirmation times of 29 seconds ( https://ethgasstation.info/ ), while BTC has median confirmation times of 30-300 minutes(!)

Here are the result highlights:\n\n* 24 respondents from USA, 14 from Europe, 6 Canada, rest were other\n* 80% of users have used Ethereum for 3 months or longer\n* Desktop wallet, MyEtherWallet.com and Coinbase.com are generally the most popular wallets\n* However, hardware wallets are the most popular primary wallet\n* Only 20% of users use Ethereum for anything other than speculating on ETH or ERC-20 token prices\n* Having custody of private keys is by far the most in-demand wallet feature (70% of users absolutely needed it)\n* A strong UX, ERC-20 token functionality, open source and no ads are somewhat preferred features\n* Having smart contract execution ability, and a built-in exchange are the least necessary features for an Ethereum wallet (over half of users were neutral or didn't care whatsoever)\n* 1/3 of users are perfectly content with their wallet. 49% would like slight improvement. 13% want significant improvement. Nobody was completely unhappy.\n\n**tl;dr** Not many people are ""using"" Ethereum right now. Many speculators. Also a successful Ethereum wallet should focus on: giving custody of private keys to users, making security and overall UX a primary goal, and just allow sending/receiving of ETH and ERC-20 tokens. \n\n**Charts for questions:**\n\n[How long have you been using Ethereum?](https://imgur.com/zXxWOTB)\n\n[What type(s) of wallets have you used for ETH?](https://imgur.com/31QBaQy)\n\n[What is your preferred/primary Ethereum wallet?](https://imgur.com/OL1NcFM)\n\n[What do you use Ethereum for primarily?](https://imgur.com/NwWlS6e)\n\n[When selecting an Ethereum wallet, how important are the following features?](https://imgur.com/1DDk1Ux)\n\n[Overall, how do you currently feel about your preferred Ethereum wallet?](https://imgur.com/6NHLuvu)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7b17rw/compiled_results_from_the_ethereum_wallet_survey/,5,0

7b1mnl,1509928815,Am I tripping or is the EtherDelta orderbook buy/sell tickers backwards?,"Check this one out for example \n\nThe 'Sell' DICE option is green .... it should be red. Selling is red not green. When something its selling it is... in the red. In most crypto markets ive seen anyways. Red cantles are ... RED because they are SELLING. \n\nOntop of that, the order of the price goes is shown downards. Suggesting that traders are selling for cheaper and cheaper. and the matching orders are .... at the most expensive sell? no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nThe Sell orders are actually the DICE buy orders. Buy with Ethereum, or sell DICE for ETH. Given that ETH is the primary trading pair. Sell DICE is really Sell ETH for dice. Or Buy DICE with ETH. \n\nAnyways, the same logic applies to the buy orders which stake upwards, wtf. Who designed this interface? its litteraly in mirror inversion. \n\nLook at any market depth chart of any exchange, you should see what I mean in minutes.\n\nPlease devs I hope you see this and fix it, cuz etherdelta has a lot of potential, it just needs to stop being confusing AF. \n\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/dgAje00.png",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7b1mnl/am_i_tripping_or_is_the_etherdelta_orderbook/,0,7

7b4d9p,1509964660,Question on smart contract escape hatches and safety concerns.,"A lot of smart contracts these days use self destruct functions that move funds in the event of a hack or bug. Now in order to convince people that you are not just going to call the self destruct function and move your customers' ether to your own adress, people use a combination of multisig wallets and time locked adresses. \n\nMy question is, as a single developer that is trying to implement such a thing, whom do you give such multisig keys to? Someone in a position of authority or of good reputation? And how do you ensure that in the event of a hack that person will be available to execute the multisig command to invoke the self-destruct function? \n\nIs there perhaps an organization or some type of smart contract that helps you do such a thing ?\n\nThanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7b4d9p/question_on_smart_contract_escape_hatches_and/,25,2
