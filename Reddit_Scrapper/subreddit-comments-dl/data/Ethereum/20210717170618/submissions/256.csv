7r1srl,1516203692,"Ether Browser Scam? Visiting Travel + Leisure site rendered MyEtherWallet, wtf?","About one of the most bizarre thing ever happened to me. Today while trying to do some readings related to travel on Travel + Leisure site (I manually entered www.travelandleisure.com to address bar, this is the official URL, and yes I am as surprised as you are they are not https), my chrome tab weirdly rendered the page for MyEtherWallet, [screenshot here](https://imgur.com/a/u3vFJ). For a second I was thoroughly confused, I double checked the url and it was the correct url for Travel + Leisure site. I opened Firefox to sanity check and it rendered MEW as well. I then opened Tor and that's when I was actually directed to T+L site, [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/CQD8t). I then visited the official MEW site and noticed the real site's banner text is different and the version number is different (3.10.4.3 vs 3.11.2.5). At this point I can be sure of few things:\n\n* I am not a MEW user and have not entered anything on either site.\n* I have checked chrome plugins and noticed no new unknown/untrusted plugins.\n* I was on a password protected public WiFi but I have asked my partner on the same wifi network to visit T+L site and he did not see MEW page rendering.\n* I inspected the suspicious site on developer tool on network tab on page load and didn't notice anything immediately obvious.\n* Suspicious site HTML markup looks similar to MEW site and links on the suspicious site are pointing to the real MEW url. But I guess it doesn't mean much since MEW is open-sourced.\n* I visited another non-ssl site I know and it rendered the correct website.\n* 30 min later when I switched back to a different wifi network the T+L url is now rendering the travel site correctly in chrome.\n* I am mac OS user.\n\nAnyone ever heard similar things happening?

7r233m,1516205991,This is how Ethereum will scale,"*I am the developer of a dApp named [KryptoWar](https://kryptowar.com), it's a war game based entirely on the Ethereum Blockchain. Today I want to spend some time exploring the scaling possibilities of the Ethereum Blockchain and how this could take dApps to a new level.*\n\n---\n\n*This article was originally published [here](https://kryptowar.com/blog/ethereum-scaling-solutions/).*\n\n---\n\nWhen it comes to the Ethereum Blockchain, scaling is the most important issue to take into consideration. The blockchain technology has expanded rapidly over the last two months, as you can see in the transactions chart [here](https://www.etherchain.org/charts/transactionsPerDay). On November 11, there were less than 500,000 transactions per day. But today, the network is approaching almost 1,500,000 daily transactions. \n\nWith the number of transactions rapidly growing—the Ethereum network’s scaling is now facing the true test of whether or not it can handle rapid user-growth.\n\nSince its development, the goal of Ethereum has always been to develop a cryptocurrency with the capacity to grow into a mainstream global currency. Unlike many other blockchain technologies, the founders of Ethereum primary intentions were to create a currency that would change the world—rather than focus on profits. \n\nThat’s why I was really excited to hear Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin say it will just take “a couple of years for the Blockchain to replace Visa” at TechCrunch Disrupt 2017.  Setting a goal like Buterin’s is extremely ambitious—but is it possible? How exactly can the Ethereum Foundation scale their digital currency platform onto a level that can provide millions of transactions per second?\n\n\n### On-chain scaling\nContrary to popular belief of blockchain, Ethereum has the potential to scale on-chain—rather than exclusively off-chain. In this article, I use on-chain scaling to refer to methods that can increase blockchain network capacity. This is one of the main ways that Ethereum’s focus diverts from other blockchain networks.\n\n###### Sharding\nThe founder of Ethereum particularly emphasizes promise behind the on-chain scaling method known as “sharding.” According to Vitalik, sharding can be understood as a blockchain that “has different universes and each of these universes is a different account space.”  The really fascinating thing about these universes is that—while they maintain distinct parameters from one another—they also share a broader “universe” that connects one another. \n\nAs a result of the blurred line that sharding enables between Ethereum’s transactions being both connected and distinct, my research shows that Shard, while it may take a while to ideally develop, will contain an unparalleled level of security and data capacity. Ultimately, I think this will allow the storage of vast amounts of state data—and extremely quickly. \n\n###### Proof of Stake\nThe product mostly developed by Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir known as “Casper” attempts to resolve issues that have previously been coined as problematic to overall PoS solutions. The function of Casper sidesteps the conventional blockchain scaling method—mining—that involves a user competition and reward system. \n\nIn place of the conventional method, Zamfir’s PoS designates validators of transactions, based on the amount of their Ether stakes, and has those validators then put up a portion of their Ethers as stakes. When these validators discover a useable block, they hedge their money on that block being certified—if they are correct about block, they are rewarded; if incorrect, they lose the money that they hedged. \n\nThe major benefit of the Casper PoS is that it has designed the Ethereum blockchain to prioritize pragmatism over user-trust. Casper is specifically designed to deter instances of potentially harmful blocks for individual benefit.\n\n### Off-chain scaling\nThe more commonly noted method of scaling blockchain technology involved off-chain scaling. This is the method that was embraced by earlier cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. I think that Ethereum is employing off-chain strategies as a result of its partial success in the past. \n\nMy definition of off-chain includes tactics to make the use of blockchain more efficient (without altering the blockchain itself), as well as decrease the use of the blockchain while increasing overall transactions.\n\n###### Raiden State Channels\n\nEthereum’s main off-chain strategy involves taking advantage of Raiden state channels. What exactly is a Raiden state channel? Essentially, the Raiden Network is channel for transactions to occur without using the blockchain every time. Similar to Bitcoin’s Lightning Network—but, in my opinion, substantially stronger and quicker.\n\nThe purpose of the Raiden Network is to increase the speed of transactions while decreasing the cost. \n\nBy avoiding the Ethereum blockchain and using its own channel to trade Ether, Raiden holds the potential to enable millions of micro-networks to facilitate off-chain transactions. The main benefit of this—it dramatically decreases the burden and requirements of Ethereum to handle. ongoing and future increases in transactions.\n\n###### Plasma\n\nPlasma, essentially, creates its own network of blocks, similar to a blockchain—only it is more of a sub-blockchain to the overall Ethereum network.  The plasma system relies on incentivizing smart contracts to allow a massive amount of state updates per second. \n\nWith Plasma’s potential fully exploited, Vitalik believes that Ethereum will be able to take complete advantage of its untapped potential.  This process relies more on user-censorship for identifying misuse of the blockchain. Through the plasma network, other users are responsible for flagging negatively intended usage of Ethereum.\n\n---\n\nI would love to hear your feedback about this article and ideas about scaling Ethereum. 2018 will be very exciting year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7r233m/this_is_how_ethereum_will_scale/,133,59
