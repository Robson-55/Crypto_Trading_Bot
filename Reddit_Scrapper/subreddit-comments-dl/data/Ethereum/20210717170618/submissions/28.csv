7cb9la,1510436943,Can ether show up in an myetherwallet without the transaction showing in etherscan?,It might be a strange question.. I made a test yesterday. I bought one ether trough both Coinbase and Lykke. I copied my address and pasted it when transferring the coins to myetherwallet. Since I’m using a somewhat high security on myetherwallet I usually use etherscan to see if the transaction went through. The Coinbase eth showed up pretty quickly and I got an email from them with eth sent and to what address. \n\nThe Lykke app only shows in the log/history that one ether is sent but does not show the receiving address. I also got a lot of errors using the app yesterday (after the eth was sent). \n\nIs it possible to receive eth but not making it show under transactions in etherscan?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7cb9la/can_ether_show_up_in_an_myetherwallet_without_the/,2,14

7ccbvx,1510448381,Is it a reasonable/possible to be able to target specialized VMs in lieu of the EVM?,"I just read about IELE: https://runtimeverification.com/blog/?p=459\n\nI like it. But I don't want, like, yet another blockchain. I like Ethereum. Short of some Plasma-solution, is it reasonable to request a different VM? Maybe even a specific version?\n\nSome issues I see with that: \n\n1. It becomes difficult to build consistent incentive models. \n2. It becomes difficult to value gas cost.\n3. Guaranteeing support means more power to the network and by having different VMs there may be nodes that do not support a particular VM which lowers overall network general compute (kinda).\n4. Compounds the problem of what ""privacy"" means and may be difficult to negotiate with certain thing like zkSNARKS. \n\nBenefits:\n\n1. Fundamental upgrades to the VM would be possible without the need for consensus. \n2. Different computational models can be supported.\n3. At-your-own-risk features can be implemented.\n4. VMs that inherently depend on, say, a particular governance model can exist.\n\nI'm leaning towards ""no, it's not reasonable,"" but I figured I'd ask the community. \n\nEDIT: Damn, /r/titlegore ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ccbvx/is_it_a_reasonablepossible_to_be_able_to_target/,5,0

I noticed at the bottom of Parity ""warp restore"" would slowly rise in percentage, though once it hit 100% it reset to 0% at least twice. When I check the logs I noticed a bunch of ""Syncing snapshot..."" and right when it reset there were about 5 lines that say ""Failed to initialize snapshot restoration: Access is denied. (os error 5)""\n\nIf someone could please help me out it'd be really appreciated.\n\n\nEDIT: I just got this error after it hit 100%\n\n""Encountered error during block restoration: FromBytesError(DataIsTooShort)""\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7cd5eu/eth_transaction_hasnt_showed_up_for_an_hour/,1,3
