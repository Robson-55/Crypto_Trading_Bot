Are all of you on hardware Trenzor etc?  What would you recommend for a wallet other than these?   Obviously there is mist wallet but it also has its issues and I don't really think i'm suited to it as a beginner (Considering you have to download the entire ledger)  \n\nNo hate please - Would love to hear your answers / advice.

7gc0lo,1511947525,How does Ethereum compare to the SPECTRE protocol?,"From their [whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1159.pdf), they suggest a small compromise on finality to get a huge boost in speed.\n\n\n&gt;Key to SPECTRE’s achievements is the fact that it satisfies weaker properties than classic consensus requires. \n\n\n&gt;In the conventional paradigm, the order between any two transactions must be decided and agreed upon by all non-corrupt nodes.\n\n\n\n&gt;In contrast, SPECTRE only satisfies this with respect to transactions performed by honest users. We observe that in the context of money, two conflicting payments that are published concurrently could only have been created by a dishonest user, hence we can afford to delay the acceptance of such transactions without harming the usability of the system.\n\n\n\nIs this a better way of doing things, or would there be a huge trade-off if Ethereum worked this way?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7gc0lo/how_does_ethereum_compare_to_the_spectre_protocol/,1,6

Proof of Work is what makes crypto special because it requires hard work (mining == electricity) to print new coins. Over time people (hardware) will get better at mining which guarantees that it will always be difficult to print new coins. This is great for cryptocurrencies because unlike fiat, they will always be deflationary.\n\nWith Proof of Stake on the other hand, once you gather enough capital, you can stop innovating and 'live off interest' which means that there won't be any intrinsic value in the newly printed coins. Whereas with Proof of Work it is precisely the electricity burned that constitutes the intrinsic value.\n\nI'm really not sure about this one although can't think of any constructive counter-arguments.
