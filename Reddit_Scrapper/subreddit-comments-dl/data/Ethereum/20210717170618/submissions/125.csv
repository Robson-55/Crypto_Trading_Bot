7jfyrh,1513131066,Gifting Ethereum,"This holiday season I'm thinking about gifting a few family members some Ethereum, none of them are particularly into Cyrptocurrancy but because they are younger (late teens/early 20's) it might be worth it for them to just hang onto and see what happens in a few years. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to gift someone Ethereum. Since I don't think any of the recipients will be actively trading or using it a hardware wallet seems a little over the top. I'm assuming I can just generate a wallet with MEW and hand over the relevant pass/key combo and that would be enough right? \n\nI'll admit I probably don't know as much about this as I should but I think it would make for a fun and interesting gift so I'd appreciate any advice.
