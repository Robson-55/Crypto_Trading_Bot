7kcbk2,1513491080,How do I move from MetaMask to gdax?,"I’ve been barely making my way through my first early purchases. My initial experience has been through MetaMask which allows me to buy Ethereum through coinbase and instantly transfer it to MetaMask. I have a coinbase account but nothing is in there, just transactions and sends. I did this cause I heard coinbase was a nightmare to deal with and I wanted in as quick as I could. Good thing as it’s worked out well so far as ethereum has risen sharply in the last 30 days. That being said I now want to realize some profits and am afraid to go back to coinbase based off the horror stories I’ve heard. I know several people who had good experience with gdax so I want to try them but I have no idea how to now send my ethereum to gdax from MetaMask. Any insight anyone can offer would be so welcome. I’m way outta my comfort zone and thrilled to be here as my first month has yielded incredible returns...but it’s all numbers until I figure out how to sell this stuff.

I was able to temporarily associate the CSS with the index.html using Tor developer tools, but that's not a permanent solution.\n\nWhat are you using, and what did you have to do to get it working on Tails v3.3? I have persistent storage enable FWIW. I would love to get my hands on Tails v3.2 (it will work with local MEW according to my research because it comes with a version of Tor prior to 7.0.7 that doesn't exhibit the local content problem), but they don't host previous versions.\n\nEdit: the title should say *local* (offline) MEW does not work with Tor. It should work fine if you are using the MEW website\n\nEdit 2: I forgot to mention that Exodus doesn't work out of the box with Tails v3.3 because required library libgconf-2.so.4 is not loaded.
