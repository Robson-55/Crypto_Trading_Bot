7xvoui,1518748322,Exposing Ethereum Honeypots,"I've noticed a plethora of scam/honeypot contracts being published on etherscan. I've also been wanting to contribute to the ethereum community more and so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to do a little write up that would go over the details of some of these contracts. There will be a bit of code in this post, though nothing too complex. Hopefully this will serve as an educational piece, but bear with me as I don't often write posts.\n### Dividend Distributor\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x858c9eaf3ace37d2bedb4a1eb6b8805ffe801bba#code\n\nThis smart contract takes advantage of a Solidity compiler bug detailed here:  https://etherscan.io/solcbuginfo?a=SkipEmptyStringLiteral. \nThis bug results in skipping the empty string literal `""""` when passed in as a function argument. Here's the code for the function of interest: \n\n    \n    function divest(uint amount) public {\n        if ( investors[msg.sender].investment == 0 || amount == 0)\n            throw;\n        // no need to test, this will throw if amount &gt; investment\n        investors[msg.sender].investment -= amount;\n        sumInvested -= amount; \n        this.loggedTransfer(amount, """", msg.sender, owner);\n    }\n    \n\nAny investor trying to divest will be in for a rude awakening when their ether is transferred to the owner's address. The bug results in this line of code `this.loggedTransfer(amount, """", msg.sender, owner)` being translated to `this.loggedTransfer(amount, msg.sender, owner)` and so the owner is the true recipient. \n\n### Private Bank\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xb5e1b1ee15c6fa0e48fce100125569d430f1bd12#code\n\nThis contract makes use of the same bug found in the infamous DAO hack. Here's the code of interest:\n\n    if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) {\n        balances[msg.sender] -= _am;\n        TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender, _am, ""CashOut"");\n    }\n\nFor anyone not familiar with the interworkings of the DAO hack, the line `msg.sender.call.value` sends the remaining gas with the `call` function, whereas `msg.sender.send(value)` only sends a fixed stipend of 2300 gas. Normally, `msg.sender` would be a typical wallet address, but in the case where it is a smart contract address the fallback function is invoked. The key here is that the ether being sent is not subtracted from the balance until *after* it is sent. If it was subtracted before, this recursive attack would not work. So all the fallback function has to do is call the `withdraw` function and add in logic to make sure it doesn't take more ether than the contract holds.\n\nSo what's wrong here? The answer lies in the `TransferLog.AddMessage` call. You may have noticed that the Log contract source was posted to etherscan, only that wasn't the real source code. Notice how the contstructor of PrivateBank sets the address of the real Log contract. All the creator of this contract had to do was make sure that the real Log contract had a function with the same signature as the `AddMessage` function posted. The real source code probably looks something like: \n\n    function AddMessage(address _sender, uint256 _amount, string _message) {\n        // note that this is not valid solidity\n        require(_sender == owner || _message == ""Deposit"");\n        // and so on ... \n    }\n\nThis translates to: if the sender isn't me or someone isn't depositing ether then fail, which will revert all state changes, thus never allowing you to withdraw your ether.\n\n### Open Address Lottery \n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xd1915A2bCC4B77794d64c4e483E43444193373Fa#code\n\nThis contract scams participants by masquerading as a legitimate lottery, but of course it's not. The malicious code is disguised by a subtle solidity quirk. Take a look at this function: \n    \n    function forceReseed() { //reseed initiated by the owner - for testing purposes\n        require(msg.sender==owner);\n        \n        SeedComponents s;\n        s.component1 = uint(msg.sender);\n        s.component2 = uint256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1));\n        s.component3 = block.difficulty*(uint)(block.coinbase);\n        s.component4 = tx.gasprice * 7;\n    \n        reseed(s); //reseed\n    }\n\nYou'll notice that an instance of the struct SeedComponent is created. Most programmers, familiar with other popular programming languages, would assume that s is a local instance of the SeedComponent struct ie. it goes on the runtime stack. However, in Solidity any *complex* data type is implicitly a storage pointer unless otherwise specified. This results in component1 pointing to index 0, component2 pointing to index 1, and so forth. The `LuckyNumber` variable lives at index 3 and is assigned the value of `tx.gasprice * 7`. This makes it impossible to win, as the winner is selected via a function that looks like `NotSoRandomNumber % 2`.\n\nHere the owner calls the `forceReseed` function:\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xf554329a9b949b408d9c75614261ae48d38c818a3f4df970cfeef7f48c2238c4\n\nAnd here's documentation outlining this quirk (it's pretty easy to gloss over it):\nhttp://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html\n\n### New Years Gift\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x13c547Ff0888A0A876E6F1304eaeFE9E6E06FC4B#code\n\nThis contract takes advantage of a small flaw in a third party resource that many of us use, etherscan. The flaw being that etherscan doesn't show contract A calling functions from contract B as a transaction under contracts B's history, making it easy to obfuscate function calls. Basically, this contract works by allowing the user to set the `hashPass` only if `passHasBeenSet` is false. Anyone who knows the input that produced the value of `hashPass` can claim the funds of this contract by calling `GetGift`. Of course, the storage variable `passHasBeenSet` is private and therefore not readable via etherscan. Luckily, we can use web3 and check the value of the variable ourselves: \n\n\n    &gt; web3.eth.getStorageAt(""0x13c547Ff0888A0A876E6F1304eaeFE9E6E06FC4B"", 1)\n    &lt; ""0x00000000000000000000008ca354f7e84881157bdbc36d8c40d5b5077621b601""\n\n\nNote that `sender` and `passHasBeenSet` belong to the same storage slot since addresses take up 20 bytes and booleans take up 1 byte (storage slots are 32 bytes). Therefore the last two characters belong to `passHasBeenSet`, which has a value of 01 -&gt; true.\n\nOn a side note, I've contacted etherscan about this issue and I imagine they will fix this at some point - which reminds me; a friend of mine recently contacted etherscan about another *flaw* where the contract source code wasn't being wrapped. Someone posted a very similar honeypot to this one where there was code being prefixed by a ridiculous number of spaces resulting in the code being rendered off screen (unless you happened to see the tiny horizontal scrollbar and scrolled over). Etherscan has since fixed this issue, in a timely matter too. \n\n\n### Summary\n\nIf anything, I hope this has been an entertaining read. If you have any questions regarding the content of this post or questions about Solidity in general, ask away; I'll do my best to answer.\n\nEDIT: Formatting - I thought Reddit allowed three backticks for code blocks ... TIL. \n\nEDIT2: Clarity/Grammar\n\nThanks for the gold kind person :) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7xvoui/exposing_ethereum_honeypots/,499,50
