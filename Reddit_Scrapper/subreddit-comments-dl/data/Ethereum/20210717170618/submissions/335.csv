7wufiq,1518373035,Ethereum is 64% of all GPU Mining by power (0.9GW of 1.4GW total),"Of course not all mining rigs mine at the same hashrate to power ratio. To arrive at the figure of 1.4GW attributable to GPU mining I [multiplied the total network hashrates of each gpu mine-able coin](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DQx9qbsAt3yM4kNa2-ypXKL80BjNPy9SrjV7-XfO3f4) with the **best hashrate to power ratio** I could find for that coins algorithm. I've included those below as well as on the [spreadsheet with the compiled data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DQx9qbsAt3yM4kNa2-ypXKL80BjNPy9SrjV7-XfO3f4). Please let me know if any should be adjusted.\n\nUsing a best case hashrate/power means that 1.4GW is a **lower bound** for electricity consumption due to total gpu mining. Similarly, for Ethereum, the 64% share of this is also a lower bound (if average Ethereum mining efficiency were lower then it would constitute a higher share of the total power). \n\nWith it's **dominance** of GPU mining, any [reduction in demand](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-858.md) that could be achieved for Ethereum gpu mining would have a considerable affect on the total market for gpu mining by **reducing profitability** which would encourage the **removal of inefficient participants**.\n\n| Algo   | Hashrate/Power    |\n|:---------|:------------|\n|Ethash	| 0.26 MH/Ws  |\n|CryptoNight	| 13.2 H/Ws  |\n|Equihash	| 2.804 H/Ws  |\n|Lyra2REv2	| 0.038 MH/Ws  |\n|Myriad-Groestl	| 0.21 MH/Ws  |\n|Blake (2b)	| 5.5 MH/Ws  |\n|Blake (14r)	| 10.4 MH/Ws  |\n|LBRY	| 0.142 MH/Ws  |\n|Groestl	| 0.142 MH/Ws  |\n|NeoScrypt	| 4.3 KH/Ws  |\n|X11Gost	| 0.05 MH/Ws  |\n|Pascal	| 5.2 MH/Ws  |",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wufiq/ethereum_is_64_of_all_gpu_mining_by_power_09gw_of/,40,16

The supplier only buys those ingredients from manufacturers/raw ingredient makers who only accept cryptocurrency for payment. So essentially, start to finish, USD is not involved. From the ground of the earth to your final order, only crypto has been used.\n\nIs there anything out there like that? I keep looking but canâ€™t find anything. And I want a damn crypto cookie. On a more meta scale, isnâ€™t this the type of system we should be making or trying to make?
