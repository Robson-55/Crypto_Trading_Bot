7cqk2e,1510609413,Could Ethereum contracts be used to incentivize spreading the word for charitable cause?,"I’m well versed in most things crypto and a software dev but smart contracts are a very new thing to me. \n\nI’m close with someone who works in the fundraising Dept for a children’s hospital. This got me thinking about how eth/tokens/contracts could be used to solicit donations and/or spread the word. \n\nThe basic idea I had breaks down essentially to a pyramid scheme where the ultimate goal is being the most awesome at getting people to donate to helping sick and disabled kids. In other words, you get someone to send money (through eth or a token or whatever) to the cause, your address gets credited say 1000 credits for it. They love the idea so everyone who they get to contribute gets them credits and you 100 credits - etc. At the end of the campaign the person(s) or groups with the most credits could get honored at a charity dinner or something like that - and they’d be able to prove their identity even though they’ve never met anyone from the hospital because only they would have access to the address that has the highest score. \n\nI’m thinking with a smart contract the entire system could be designed to be transparent so donators would be 100% assured that the money goes directly to the organization, and the scoring system would be provably fair and out in the open. And by using crypto it would lower the friction for donating and extend its reach potentially even worldwide. \n\nIdeally there would also be some process by which people who understand crypto/eth would be able to serve as a bridge to those who don’t understand the first thing about eth - like non-crypto guy A gives crypto-guy B $10, he sends $10 worth of ETH to the fund and says non-crypto guy made the actual donation, and there’s a public website that can verify and display that non-crypto guy was the donator, and crypto-guy was the bridge that made it happen - and of course he gets a few extra points for it. \n\nThoughts? Is this something that could actually work or am I just some guy that barely understands smart contracts enough to know what they’re capable of? \n\nSide note: If the idea is workable and has legs, there is a potential chance of getting a particular A-list celebrity involved who has ties to the hospital. Just want to throw that out there to emphasize this isn’t some random idea I came up with on the toilet or another DAO - it’s a real hospital in a major American city, real sick kids, etc - and I’m hoping maybe a really good use case for something lots of people aren’t even convinced is real money yet. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7cqk2e/could_ethereum_contracts_be_used_to_incentivize/,1,1

7ctsl6,1510641125,Some user education about Ethereum addresses.,"# Introduction\n\nI believe that all readers have met Ethereum addresses or ""Ethereum accounts"" in various forms. \n\n1. We all have seen hex addresses like `0x12300b5fe614110012300631d7ff070180004321`.\n\n2. There are password protected ""keystore json UTC files"" that you can unlock in ClassicEtherWallet or MyEtherWallet to access your account. \n\n3. You can also see password-protected accounts in MetaMask.\n\n4. Hardware wallets also store and allow access to your Ethereum address.\n\n5. There were ""Parity phrases"" that allows to access your account somehow but I didn't ever used it.\n\nAs you can see there are plenty of different possibilities to store and access your accounts. They seem to be different, but there is one detail that you should know: **your Ethereum account is your private key and nothing more.**\n\n# Some technical descriptions\n\nEthereum account = private key. Your hex address that you will see on the blockchain is generated from your private key. \n\nEach 64-character string (besides 64 zeros) is considered a valid private key for Ethereum network. And there is one address associated with each private key.\n\nPrivate keys are not really ""generated"". Private keys always exist and wait for someone to pick up one of them and start using it. Nothing is written to blockchain when you click ""generate wallet""  and no wallet is really generated. The service that provides ""wallet generation functionality"" will just pick one of private keys (generate 64 random hexadecimal characters that would serve you as private key) and represent it to you.\n\nThere is a constant algorithm for extracting the address from the private key, which always extracts one address and only this address from a certain private key.\n\nI wrote a small program that illustrates the process of extracting an address from any 64-character string (potential private key):\n\nhttps://dexaran.github.io/KeyExtractor/\n\nNOTE: hex address is not a public key. Address is a first 20 bytes of Keccak-256 hash of account's public key.\n\n# How this different accounts work\n\nAll these accounts represent your private key in different forms. For example keystore JSON file is an encrypted version of your private key. *Keystore file password is only required to unencrypt your private key*. Password is not required to send transactions or operate with your account, it's an extraneous detail that was specially introduced to improve the security of your funds.\n\nHardware wallet stores your private key and extract your address from it each time you want to see it.\n\nMetaMask stores your private key also.\n\n# IMPORTANT: Some effects that you should be aware of\n\nAs the algorithm for extracting of an address from a private key is exactly the same on Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and any of the Ethereum-based networks (Expanse, UBQ, PIRL) it is also possible to use your private key on any of this networks and it will result in exactly the same address.\n\n**Education #1: You can use one address on multiple chains.**\n\nSmart-contract addresses are generated from sender address and transaction nonce. \n\n**Education #2: It is possible to create a couple of smart-contracts with same addresses on different chains.**\n\nYou can also give someone your address on any of the Ethereum-based chains since you can access your own address with your private key on different chains and it will be exactly the same address on any of the Ethereum-based chains. This means that you can give your ENS name as the recipient addres and successfully receive ETC, UBQ or any other currency using your ""myethereumaddress.eth"" name.\n\n**Education #3: You can use ENS names on multiple chains.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ctsl6/some_user_education_about_ethereum_addresses/,63,35

7cu3m9,1510645256,Hardware wallet people: what do you dislike most about your device?,"One of the largest hurdles I see right now to widespread adoption of blockchain tech is the high level of technical knowledge required to be your own bank. If you subscribe to the idea that people will be responsible for storing their private keys, they need to overcome the high knowledge barrier to do so.\n\nImagine your average mom/dad/brother/sister/cousin/whatever just getting into the blockchain space. Between phishing websites, hacked exchanges, faulty contract code, and malware on hacked machines, there is a lot to overcome before being confident that your coins won't get stolen.\n\nSo far the solution is to have a physical device with you (but not your cell phone) to do this type of work. There are some good devices out there, but I have a question for redditors: if you were to design a hardware wallet, what features would you make sure it had?\n\nHow would you make it so simple that your average joe on the street could use it? \n\nOr, maybe you don't think it needs to be like that because the majority of services will run the blockchain on the back end.
