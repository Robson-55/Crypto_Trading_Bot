7o6360,1515101234,I took your suggestions and built a tool that builds a spreadsheet of your capital gain/loss on a per trade basis to assist you in reporting cryptocurrency trading on your taxes this year!,"A few days ago I posted about my iOS app that sends you notifications when your GDAX orders fill.\n\nI have changed focus for the time being and am actively putting my free time towards building out new features on the website:\n\nhttp://cointradealerts.com\n\nThis new feature does what the reporting tools on GDAX/Coinbase lack: It dynamically matches together both ends of a suspected single trade (side 1: buy | side 2: sell) and computes a capital gain/loss figure on that specific trade, and then finally, emails you the spreadsheet. In doing so, I believe that this is a very accurate way to gauge your net profit/loss, as well as see your per trade performance.\n\nThe reason for me doing this was that I noticed that GDAX reports simply send you a PDF containing a list of your orders, however, that means that it's on you to go through the data and match the ends of a trade together.\n___\nInstructions:\n\n* Sign up on http://cointradealerts.com\n* Create a view only API key and enter it on the Coin Trade Alerts settings page\n* Head over to http://cointradealerts.com/report\n* Select your GDAX product, verify your details, and enter an email address for your report to be sent to.\n\n___\nThis tool is not 100% accurate of course. There will be rare instances where it can not find a match, or it finds an incorrect price match. This is rare though. In my testing on my GDAX order book with 60+ orders, there was 1 instance in which this happened. \n\nAt the current time, this feature has only been tested for Coin to USD pairs.\n\nSomething that I will definitely look towards doing is working on the coin to coin trading pairs and computing profits that way. It wouldn't be very hard, as I could use the timestamp from the trade to make a historical price query on the GDAX API to get what the price was at that current time :)\n___\nI have chosen release this tool in an exclusive beta phase. Your Coin Trade Alerts account must be granted access to use it by me. If your account doesn't have access, you'll receive a message alerting you. Please post your account username below if you'd like to use this feature. I'll let a moderate number of people test this feature, compile feedback from them, act on the feedback, and then release the full version. \n___\n**Please note: I will be charging a small upfront fee when the full version comes out. I haven't decided on the number, however it will definitely be negligible.**\n\n**Also, I know people are hesitant about providing API credentials to a stranger, so, when the feature fully releases I will also be providing the source code and simple instructions so you can run it yourself locally on your own machine for the same small monetary free**\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7o6360/i_took_your_suggestions_and_built_a_tool_that/,1,5
