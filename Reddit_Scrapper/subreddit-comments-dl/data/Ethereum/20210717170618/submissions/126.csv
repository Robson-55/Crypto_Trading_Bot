7jhmqj,1513149491,Casper POS: 33% attack possible since not enough incentive to stake ETH,"The following is a quote taken from a Cosmos blog.  Cosmos is opting for two 'tokens' on its hub: One (Atom) for staking and one (Photon) for fees.  They argue that this helps prevent a 33% attack.  Ethereum's Casper upgrade (to proof of stake) will continue to only have one (ETH) token for both staking and fees.  \n\n\nCase Study: Casper\n\nMany of you know that Ethereum is transitioning away from its Proof-of-Work model to a Proof-of-Stake one via an economic overlay called Casper. With Casper, Ethereum intends to use its existing fee token (ETH) as the staking token.\n\nIn this single token model, the economic utility of said token is twofold: staking and transactional. This introduces more liquidity into the token as greater utility is bundled into a single token, and creates less of an incentive for people to stake their tokens. What’s more alarming, greater liquidity results in weaker network security, allowing potential attackers to stealthily accrue the amount of tokens necessary to attack a Proof-of-Stake system.\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario where Casper has been implemented in the Serenity Ethereum blockchain, let’s say a whale owns 5% of the total supply of Ether. If less than 15% of all Ether were staked, this whale could single-handedly pull off a 33% attack (Byzantine Fault Tolerance threshold). This scenario is not unlikely to occur since the utility of Ether extends far beyond that of staking, which unfortunately inadvertently magnifies security risks for the Ethereum network.\n\n/u/Mr_Yukon_C\n\nhttps://blog.cosmos.network/cosmos-fee-token-introducing-the-photon-8a62b2f51aa",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jhmqj/casper_pos_33_attack_possible_since_not_enough/,5,3
