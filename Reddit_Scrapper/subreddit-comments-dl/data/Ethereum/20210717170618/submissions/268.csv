7ruabz,1516493857,What does Ethereum think of Proof of Capacity (space)?,Proof of Work takes a lot of energy resources and is not environmentally friendly. Proof of Stake requires people to lock down their assets for mining - making the Ethereum economy less efficient. I'm wondering what the Ethereum fans think of Proof of Capacity. Proof of Capacity basically uses allocated storage instead of processing power to determine who will forge block. It's a far greener way of verifying transactions. \n\nWhat do you think of Proof of Capacity (space) ?

7ruh96,1516495769,"Hybrid dApps, a solution to the high cost of gas on Ethereum?","Hi All,\n\nMy team and I are working on a dApp/game we hope to release later this year (We will have a post in the next month with more details on our dApp if your interested). As we are deep into internal testing a question has popped up among us devs and I thought I would reach out to get the communities take on this issue.\n\nThe question:\nIs a hybrid dApp an acceptable approach when creating a blockchain game? \n(I.E. Moving parts of the application logic to run off blockchain.)\n\nOur thoughts:\nInternally some of us feel that a hybrid solution would break the trustless nature of our app and would require users to trust that, WE the developer, won’t make arbitrary changes. The higher gas cost is the tax that users of dApps pay for not needing to trust. The others side feels that the need for trust is offset by the reduction in gas costs and overall reduction in the cost per play. Our current case shows a reduction from 700k to 80k gas units. The thought is, since the capital investment to play has been reduced less trust is required. The lower gas cost increases the amount of plays a user can make and hopefully increases the overall amount of fun :-D a user will have.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts on these approaches.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ruh96/hybrid_dapps_a_solution_to_the_high_cost_of_gas/,2,3

With this list of transactions, QuickBlock can further give you a report on your gains and losses priced at the time of the transaction in fiat. You may use this report to help you in your tax preparations.\n\nWe're looking for 10-15 alpha users who would be willing to help us test and debug our software.

7ruyso,1516501008,I don't think my node is synced yet eth.syncing returns false,"I have ether in my account but it still shows a balance of zero.  I assume this is because the node is not synced.  Given it's only about 47GB I know I don't have the full blockchain as it's in the 100's now right?  However when I type geth.syncing I get false.  \n\nWhen I look at the main console it looks like it's syncing stuff, but then when I do a geth attach and type anything in the console I just get 0 for everything.  Checking balance, checking if it's syncing, even checking for latest block.  It's always zero or false.  It's almost like I'm actually running my own private node...  I really hope that's not the case because it means I probably won't be able to recover the funds from the account I'm mining to as the account probably got created on the local node and the one I'm mining to is probably arbitrary/nonexistant. I really hope that's not the case!   \n\nAlso, just to clarify, an account is a wallet right?
