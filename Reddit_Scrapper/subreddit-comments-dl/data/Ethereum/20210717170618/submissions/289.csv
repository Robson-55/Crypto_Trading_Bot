7telre,1517078329,Configuring an Ethereum node to only cache state for a certain contract?,"Here's some background for the question:\n\n* I'm creating a smart contract and would like to track historic behavior with events.  For example, a bank contract keeps track of the current balance of an account in storage, but each independent deposit/withdraw emits an event.  My understanding is that using events for historical record is the preferred mechanism since it's much cheaper than storage.\n\n* I'd like to create a companion website to render the historical events.  In my use case, users will need fast access to random events (sorting, searching, etc), so I plan on having the backend listen to a local Ethereum node for events, and cache these in a local database for fast lookup -- providing my own API rather than expecting users to get event data with a client-side web3 instance.\n\nMy concern is for the Ethereum node.  I'm not sure I have the resources to run a full Ethereum node on my server.  I really just need the node to keep state parity on just my contract (i.e. only transactions that iteract with it, only events that it outputs).  I don't need the node to track any other events, address balances or contracts.\n\nIs there a way to configure an Ethereum node to do this?  (In a sense, prune all of the other data from its local data store.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7telre/configuring_an_ethereum_node_to_only_cache_state/,0,1

7tev03,1517080605,blockie-picker: when when you want an address that looks good,"There was a thread the other day about the identicons shown in MyEtherWallet and Mist (and others), where someone made a comment about looking for an identicon they liked. I had recently refactored the identicon code out of [eth-button](), moving it to its own library.\n\nHow hard could it be to build a simple site that does that?\n\nNot hard at all!  Enjoy [`blockie-picker`](https://eth-button.github.io/blockie-picker/), an Ethereum vanity address generator that focuses on the identicon, not the address itself.\n\nI will update the README shortly, and can answer any questions here.  It's a static site with no external (to the library) javascript, so it *should* be safe to use.  However, if you do not want to run that risk, you can clone the [repository](https://github.com/eth-button/blockie-picker), install the dependencies with `npm install`, and run the dev server with `npm run dev`.  This will host the repository locally for you to use.\n\n[E] As always, comments, suggestions, bug reports, and pull requests are welcome",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7tev03/blockiepicker_when_when_you_want_an_address_that/,6,2
