7ehv9i,1511271383,iOS wallets,"Hi all, have had a search but all the threads seem pretty old. Just trying to find out the current state of iOS wallets for ETH. I was looking at Jaxx and imToken, but have read various bugs and negative things about both. \n\nAny recommendations in terms of security, reliability and ease of use? I probably won't be making too many transactions, mainly just want it at the moment to take my ETH off of the exchange where it's been sitting for a few weeks. \n\nThanks ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ehv9i/ios_wallets/,11,12

I don't know enough about the tech  Thoughts?

7ek8ho,1511290951,Ethereum Denver - November 30th - Etherisc &amp; Decentralized Insurance Protocol (DIP),"RSVP [here](https://www.meetup.com/Ethereum-Denver/events/239018588/).\n\nHello Ethereans - \n\nAllowing ample time to recover from your turkey coma, we're excited to announce November's event. \n\nPlease welcome Etherisc, a longstanding Ethereum-based project: \n\nEtherisc is building decentralized insurance platform that enables anyone to create their own insurance products. Etherisc Flight Delay is the first real insurance product built with Etherisc. Products built on top of Etherisc platform use DIP. DIP is token of a decentralized insurance protocol, an open ecosystem of infrastructure and incentivization mechanisms. \n\nEtherisc’s mission is to enable building decentralized insurance applications, making the purchase and sale of insurance more efficient, enable lower operational costs, provide greater transparency into the industry of insurance compared to traditional operations, and democratize access to reinsurance investments. Etherisc is most well known for its Flight Delay Dapp, an insurance for flight delays realised as a smart contract, which was live on the Ethereum main net for Ethereum developer conference Devcon 2016. Later it won a main prize at the Blockchain Startup Contest in Graz and then became the most financed project at the ether.camp hackathon. The first product built on Etherisc platform is available for usage at\n\nhttps://fdd.etherisc.com/.\n\nA smart contract holds the premium paid and automatically assigns the claim when an event happens. This reduces the overhead of traditional insurances, and makes a lot of new business models possible. \n\nAttendees will learn: - Current state and statistics on the usage of insurance products built on Etherisc - Overview of smart contract architecture - Roadmap - Token mechanics \n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER: Renat Khasanshyn, Co-Founder of Etherisc. Before joining Etherisc, Renat was Venture Partner at Runa Capital and CEO of Altoros. Most recently Renat led inception of insurance practice at Altoros together with its key customers Allianz, Allstate and Liberty Mutual, focusing on canonical use cases of blockchain, - fronting, reinsurance and insurance securitization (catastrophe bonds). Renat co-founded Altoros, a 250+ employee strong software and research laboratory in the area of distributed databases, container orchestration &amp; developer marketplaces.\n\nPizza and beer (on a first-come, first-served basis) will be generously provided by our friends at [Ideas By Nature](http://www.ideasbynature.com/). IBN is one of the leading blockchain-oriented dev shops in the industry, and they're a proud and ardent supporter of the Denver blockchain community.\n\nThanks also to Pivotal for hosting again. Pivotal specializes in custom software projects, and has several offices spread around the globe.\n\nSee you on the 30th!\n\nThe Ethereum Denver Team",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ek8ho/ethereum_denver_november_30th_etherisc/,1,5
