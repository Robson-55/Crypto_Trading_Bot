7icm0h,1512708876,Would this be a good example of how Ethereum might shape our financial future?,"I recently read about Panera Bread going from being a public company to a private company. Read up on what the process for that looks like; turns out that before a company goes private, they have to hold a shareholders meeting and majority of them have to decide on a share price point - once that's decided everyone's get compensated accordingly.\n\nNow I don't know how that process looks like or how much time it takes, but if we were to replicate that scenario with Ethereum in mind (or atleast just its potential), would it be that Panera Bread could have defined a smart contract stating that most shareholders have to agree on a price; once agreed, credit their wallet with the amount according to the shares they hold\n\nThis way, I assume the transition from stock to funds would have been super fast and probably it would've been better for the company too to get more effecient voting results, getting them the best possible price for their stock (maybe?)\n\nI hope this is how its supposed to work with smart contracts because if there's a possibility that this scenario could be possible, I'm thinking that companies might just be able to do their own IPOs with smart contracts, by passing all the paper work\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7icm0h/would_this_be_a_good_example_of_how_ethereum/,1,3

Just recently bought some ETH for the first time. I thought Bitcoin was crappy with long TXs times, high fees but boy ETH is really something special. But let me get specific:  \n  \n* TXs that are made simply dont show up anywhere and cant be found\n* the given TXID (wallet MEW or exchange) cant be found on the blockexplorer, you have no clue what is going on\n* after a dozen hours (13h) the ETH shows suddenly up in my wallet, TXID still doesnt show up, blockexplorer doesnt show wallet TXs\n* despite decent fees hours and hours of waiting\n* made a TX from MEW. ETHs are subtracted, TX cant be found, Walletadress doesnt show a TX has been made  \n* next day the TX still not there but suddenly the ETH are in the wallet available  (so I can send them again?) - what a MESS\n* shitty wallets, no decent destop wallet, have to download 100gb blockchain, not one single smart contract desktop wallet for windows w/o downloading the whole fucking blockchain\n* only web-based wallet MEW - at every step the password/file has to be put in, extremely uncomfortable to use, no history, no nothing \n* TX dont go into pending TXs, you have no clue what is going on, its not transparent  \n* there is no decent way to calculate what fee will get you a quick TX unlike BTC where you can use Johoes Site to calculate exact fees  \n  \nAll in all the experience has been VERY bad and even though BTC is very slow (so is ETH) and expensive. the usability is WAY better.
