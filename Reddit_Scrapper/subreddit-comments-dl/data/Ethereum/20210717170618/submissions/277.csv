7si553,1516744897,Can you please take a look at my idea? (+Looking for developer),"Hi all,\n\nI recently got an idea that might interest some people. With the recent drop, we've all seen how volatile cryptocurrencies are. So I had the idea of creating an ERC20 token that will help crypto users to secure their funds.\n\nThis token would have two major functionalities: First, it will work like a regular POS token, so new tokens will be issued by minting blocks. These newly created coins will be spreaded through the network and you'll receive coins depending on how much coins you have currently in staking. Alongside, the block reward will not be fixed but will be very flexible for a reason that I will explain later. Then, you can also ""freeze"" not only tokens, but values on the blockchain. Here it get trickier. In fact, an user will be able to freeze an amount of coins. But this user (we'll call him Jack) is not going to freeze an AMOUNT of coins: he is going to freeze it's coins VALUE. The coins will get frozen for a number of blocks and Jack will pay more and more fees if he keeps his tokens frozen. When the network will reach the ""unfreezing block"", Jack is not going to receive the EXACT amount of coins he frozed: If the coin's value augmented, he'll receive less tokens and other tokens will be burned. But if coin's value dropped, Jack will receive more tokens.\n\nA freezed token is not counted on the user's staking balance. In fact, this coin will let the right to choose between 2 options: -If you let your tokens in your wallet you can stake but you take the risk that their value drop or rise. -If you freeze them you can't stake and you won't make profit from coin's price rise.\n\nBut, with this system, I got a major problem: I need to be able to create and burn coins when I want in order to assure freezing system's stability. There are many options: do a gigantic premine ( Roll Eyes ), control all the token emission like Ripple or use burned tokens. This is also why block reward MUST be flexible: if the coin's price is getting to high, I'll just set an upper block reward in order to reduce coin price. The second problem is that the coin cannot know itself it price. I have thinked to use only EtherDelta as the trading exchange in order to get only one price from a decentralized organisation. Thanks for reading me, I would be very glad if you can tell me if my idea is good or not, and what I can improve (except my English, not my native language sry)\n\n\nI'm currently researching a dev, so if there's anyone interested please PM me. If I posted this in the wrong section, or if you know any useful link, can you please redirect me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7si553/can_you_please_take_a_look_at_my_idea_looking_for/,1,2

7sihqa,1516747786,Quick question about contract ownership and decentralization,"Hey,\n\nSo I've been looking into ethereum and smart contracts since a few weeks, there is one point I still do not totally get and I've not found the topic being broached anywhere else : apparently, it is considered good practice to allow a contract to have an owner. That owner would be able to make updates to the contract's code in case a bug is found or for the contract to be updated later on if new features are to be added, and could be transferred to another address if needed.\n\nMy point is, while these are valid reasons, doesn't this kind of destroys the whole point of decentralization, adding a single point of failure and someone on who an hostile entity/government/whatever could put pressure on to get ownership of the contract ?\n\nOr is the ownership supposed to be only temporary while the contract is still in its ""alpha"" stage ? Could anybody help me understand that part ?\n\nMany thanks ! :)\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7sihqa/quick_question_about_contract_ownership_and/,1,4
