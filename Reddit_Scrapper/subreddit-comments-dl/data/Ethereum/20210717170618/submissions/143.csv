The notes are also located [here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/tree/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings).\n\n**NOTE: The next core dev meeting will be January 12th due to the holidays. [Agenda is located here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/29).**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Ethereum Core Devs Meeting 29 Notes\n### Meeting Date/Time: Friday 12/01/17 at 14:00 UTC\n### Meeting Duration: 1 hour\n### [GitHub Agenda Page](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/27)\n### [Audio/Video of the meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GulA7iA-O0)\n\n# Agenda\n\n1. Testing Updates\n  a. Fuzzer updates.\n  b. [New transaction tests folder structure.](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/gentransact/TransactionTests)\n2. [Shall we require CC0 notices in EIPs?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/27#issuecomment-348181284)\n3. New Project: JSON RPC Proxy / eth-agent\n  a.

POA Testnet unification [Update]\n6. Core team updates.\n\n# Notes\nVideo starts at [4:03](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=243)\n\n## [[6:05](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=365)] 1. Testing Updates\n\n### a. Fuzzer updates\nGo and Rust clients can work with it and Guido is working on integrating cpp-ethereum. Guido is also working on a bignum fuzzer to make sure bignum libraries are aligned across the clients. Smart contract fuzzing has been discussed, as has fuzzing the network stack, but it has not started yet.\n\n### [[8:56](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=536)]  b. [New transaction tests folder structure.](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/gentransact/TransactionTests)\nThere have been changes to the transaction tests to help organize it better and be more representative of the different categories. More technical detail in the call.\n\n## [[11:00](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=660)] 2. [Shall we require CC0 notices in EIPs?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/27#issuecomment-348181284)\nWe agreed that the requirement for CC0 notice should be made going forward. Yoichi made a pull request on EIP 1 to change that. Existing EIPs that do not have the copyright will need to change and we can create PRs for them that they just have to give written permission to change.\n\n## [[35:10](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=2110)] 3. New Project: JSON RPC Proxy / eth-agent\n  a. Discussion: https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/issues/4563\n  b. Proof of Concept: https://github.com/chfast/json-rpc-proxy/releases/tag/v0.1.0a1\ncpp-ethereum components are being separated into separate projects. Components that are not required to run an Ethereum node may be split from the core cpp-ethereum code. The first component to be split off are the HTTP server that is in the client. The JSON RPC proxy can sign transactions for you which acts like an account management component in a way. An update to EthStats which moves it to the shared tooling projects may also be in the works soon.\n\nSeparating the account management from the client will help lessen the security overhead of the Ethereum node operators. geth is planning on slowly moving away from account management and Martin is working on an account management tool with a public API that doesn't take passwords. It instead requires interaction with a custom UI and sending remote transactions to the tool.\n\n## [[14:56](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=896)] 4. [Does it remain the case that the Yellow Paper is intended to be Ethereum's formal specification?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/27#issuecomment-347997598)\nBen brought up some questions (linked in the title) about the future of the Yellow Paper and it's place as the official specification for clients.\n\nBen's questions:\n&gt; Question: does it remain the case that the YP is intended to be Ethereum's formal specification?\n&gt; \n&gt; If yes, then it should be noted that the YP is currently significantly out of date.\n&gt; \n&gt; a. What is the plan for bringing the YP up to date post-Byzantium?\n&gt; \n&gt; b. What is the process and ownership for maintaining the YP going forward?\n&gt; \n&gt; c. Should updating the YP be made part of the EIP finalization process?\n&gt; \n&gt; d. To facilitate c., Should EIPs be required to include a pull request to the Yellow Paper (if relevant) before they are accepted?\n&gt; \n&gt; e. When consensus failures are discovered (e.g. during the recent fuzz testing), how can we make sure that the YP is updated where necessary?\n&gt; \n&gt; If no,\n&gt; \n&gt; a. What replaces the YP as the authoritative specification of Ethereum?\n&gt; \n&gt; b. Is the YP worth maintaining as a resource that is descriptive rather than prescriptive? If so, the questions above still stand.\n\nHaving changes to the Yellow Paper or other formal spec. be merged before certain EIPs are accepted is a good idea.\n\nGavin Wood maintains the [Yellow Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper) and there are a list of contributors to the Yellow Paper on GitHub. The Yellow Paper doesn't have a copyright which opens up some confusing legal issues for those wanting to fork the Yellow Paper or make unofficial changes that are not merged by Gav. Biggest concern is it is unclear who can legally merge pull requests without legal concerns being attached. There are currently pull requests for the Yellow Paper to bring it up to date.\nThe Yellow Paper isn't a complete specification of everything needed to build a client and some expressed opinions that the Yellow Paper is difficult to read. [KEVM](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics) is a formal specification written in K that can be execute test cases that may be a candidate to replace the Yellow Paper. KEVM is licensed under UIUC/NCSA License. Afri is going to reach out to Gavin to ask about updating and licensing the Yellow Paper include him in this conversation.\n\nPiper suggested having a developer grant for a group that keeps the Yellow Paper or other formal spec. up to date. Currently Dev Grants (Ethereum Foundation grants program) is not active, but may be active in the future.\n\n## [[43:24](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=2604)] 5. POA Testnet unification [Update]\nNo updates.\n\n## [[43:51](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=2631)] 6. Core team updates.\n- Parity - Working on release 1.5. No major new features. Mostly working on stabilizing stuff. Improvements on database layer are also happening, specifically replacing the database layer with a new type of database. They are working on Parity multi-sig issue and preparing a list of different approaches on how we can address the problem. They will present a list of proposals at the next core dev meeting. ""We will discuss them with the community and see where it goes from there.""\n- geth - New release with no major changes. Working on improving the block tracing.\n- cpp-ethereum - Still is post-Mexico mode from Devcon3. Mostly cleaning up some stuff from the Byzantium hard fork. Yoichi has been going through and updating EIPs. Discussion is ongoing with Pawel and Andrei about a roadmap for features. Dimitry has been updating the testing framework. Shout out to Martin H.S, cdetrio, Guido, and other who are contributing to the fuzzer framework\n- Harmony - Migrated client to RocksDB. Work is basically complete on making Harmony compatible.\n- ethereum-js - No updates.\n- pyEVM - Big GitHub migration from Piper's GitHub to Ethereum Foundation's GitHub. Repos have been re-named to make it more clear what each one does. Pretty far along with implementing the light client protocol. Early alpha release of the client (currently called Trinity) expected in the next month. Integration with Hive and JSON-RPC specs are still left to do. The research team is working on moving their Casper implementation to pyEVM.\n- pyethapp - There is Casper research testnet utilizing pyethereum.\n- EWASM - Roadmap has been created. Aim to launch a preliminary testnet by the end of January.\n- Solidity - Release made the day before that had some improvements including fully implemented ABI encoding/decoding (will require specifying experimental release in the header). Really focusing on the SMT solver in Solidity for the next release.\n\nMartin H.S mentioned that there is someone working on a C# Ethereum client that is passing almost all state tests and VM tests. Estimates are that it will be complete in a couple of months. At this point it is still in a private repository, but if people want to help out reach out to Martin and he will connect you.\n\n## Attendance\n\nAfri Schoedon (Parity), Alex Beregszaszi (EWASM/Solidity), Anton Nashatyrev (ethereumJ), Christian Reitwiessner (cpp-ethereum/Solidity), Dimitry Khokhlov (cpp-ethereum), Hudson Jameson (Ethereum Foundation), Lefteris Karapetsas (Raiden), Marek Kotewicz (Parity), Martin Holst Swende (geth/security), Nick Johnson (geth), PaweÅ‚ Bylica (cpp-ethereum), Piper Merriam (pyEVM), Yoichi Hirai (EVM)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Ethereum Core Devs Meeting 30 Notes\n### Meeting Date/Time: Friday 12/15/17 at 14:00 UTC\n### Meeting Duration: 1 hour\n### [GitHub Agenda Page](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28)\n### [Audio/Video of the meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naPA7tjrgsk)\n### [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jxtex/live_stream_in_8_hours_ethereum_core_devs_meeting/)\n\n# Agenda\n\n1.

Final tests will still be JSON, this only affects the test source. Those who write tests can use YAML and use multi-line contract source code and write comments.\n\n## [[1:12](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=72)] 2. Digital cats caused network congestion this month. Meow.\n\n### [[1:22](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=82)] a. Why did this happen and what solutions are available to prevent future network congestion? See comments below for some ideas.\nThe gas limit was 6.7 million and crypto kitties used 1-2 million gas per block worth of demand. Usage pushed the transaction fees higher due to demand. Miners upped the gas limit a bit, but usage has grown even more and we are now at an 8 million gas limit and blocks are basically full.\n\n### [[2:20](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=140)] b. [Stateless Clients proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-349676284).\n[Alexey Akhunov](https://github.com/AlexeyAkhunov) [described a stateless protocol design](https://medium.com/@akhounov/how-to-speed-up-ethereum-in-the-face-of-crypto-kitties-7a9c901d98e9). Vitalik has [been pushing the stateless protocol paradigm](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/regarding-bandwidth-requirements-for-stateless-clients-i-can-give-some-precise-numbers-be357fb69b6d) a lot because it is the direction they are looking at for sharding research. Stateless clients means that instead of the client storing the entire state the client would just store the state root and it would be the responsibility of the miners or transaction senders to package up with the block or the transaction the witness blocks. Witness blocks contain merkle branches that prove that all of the parts of the state required for processing all transactions in that block, and computing the next state root. Although this is theoretically viable, it would require a lot of substantial changes to gas costs and other factors [described here](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/regarding-bandwidth-requirements-for-stateless-clients-i-can-give-some-precise-numbers-be357fb69b6d). Other optimizations include the making it so we can access Patricia tree nodes in parallel and bumping cache sizes.\nLow effort scaling solutions could potentially be included in Constantinople.\n\nA complete discussion on these issues is [included here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28).\n\n### c. [Would having minimum system requirements to set up an optimal client/full node help?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-351141485).\nDiscussed tangentially in subsection b.\n\n### [[24:12](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=1452)] d. [Is the bottleneck is not just disk bandwidth, but specifically sequential disk bandwidth? ](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-351350231).\nVitalik asks: Are random SSD reads parallizable? Would it take less time to perform 20 random reads than doing a single read? This may help with optimization to do multiple tree reads in parallel. Although it is not fully clear, it appears to be faster, but does it help with DBs like LevelDB? In theory it is likely fast, but in practice it depends on the DB and things like pre-loading the data into a cache or performing computations while pre-loading the data. In geth it may not make a difference because of the way LevelDB works. [Alexey Akhunov volunteered to do some benchmarks to answer some of these questions](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-352021812).\n\n### [[31:07](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=1867)] e. [Vitalik has some ideas around gas cost changes and scalability-relevant client optimizations.](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-350941632)\nMain point: Vitalik thinks state reads are underpriced and pointed out some other scalability improvements that are quick wins.\n\n&gt; 1. Increase the price of blockchain reads.\n&gt; 2. [EIP 648: Parallelization](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/648).\n&gt; 3. Two account destroying/dust clearing EIPs ([168](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/168)/[169](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/169)).\n\nMartin HS wondered what the impact of increasing price on blockchain reads would have on the amount of gas used per block and fill up blocks more quickly. Vitalik says that he thinks the purpose of re-pricing is to improve the worst case rather than the average case. We still need to encourage devs to write their contracts better, but the more important thing is being pro-active about risks of actual attacks on the network. Risk of attack on the network is lower this year compared to last year. An attack that fills even a third of the block gas limit would end up making TX fees rise to $2 or more and burn through a million of dollars in a few days, but is still something worth being concerned about.\n\nState channels are something that is a non-protocol, off-chain solution for scaling that Dapp developers should be paying attention to.\n\n## [[35:52](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=2152)] 3. [Plans on Quantum-resistant cryptography and any plans to include it in the next update?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-350954470).\nAccount abstraction is not ""necessary"", but there isn't really a point on creating a single quantum proof algorithm, but using account abstraction would make it more general and what they are using for Casper. There is [an Ethereum Research thread going on talking about the tradeoffs in account abstraction that needs more commentary](https://ethresear.ch/t/tradeoffs-in-account-abstraction-proposals/263).\n\n## [[38:32](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=2312)] 4. [Introduction to KEVM team (Everett H.)](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics)\nEverett Hildenbrandt, Daejun Park, and Phil Daian gave introductions to themselves and KEVM.\n\nKEVM is a formalization of the EVM in the K language. K is an operational semantics framework that gives you a bunch of software dev tools once you formalize your language in K. KEVM is executable and testable so it can generate and pass state tests. It can be eventually used to generate test cases by the specification rather than by a client such as cpp-ethereum. Some experimental prototypes to extend the EVM with some high-level languages have occurred, most recently Daejun has been helping a lot on the semantics of Viper. Goal is to provide some formal tools for the Viper language which involves formalizing the Viper language on top of KEVM (translating the Python version of Viper into a mathematically definition in K). A number of tools are created from this formalization of Viper including proving compiler correctness and migration of Solidity contracts into Viper using bytecode comparison. More information is included in [this blog post](https://runtimeverification.com/blog/?p=617). Additionally there has been work on compilation from KEVM to a web based and human readable documentation of the KEVM semantics. It is meant to be like the Yellow Paper, but it can be fully compiled into a full implementation of the EVM. It is called ""The Jello Paper"" and [can be found here](https://thehydra.io/evm/). The KEVM project is split across two entities: The University of Illinois (U.S) and Runetime Verification Inc.\n\n## [[47:12](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=2832)] 5. [Follow-up: Does it remain the case that the Yellow Paper is intended to be Ethereum's formal specification?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/27#issuecomment-347997598).\nBen Edgington from Consensys's Pegasys protocol engineering team and Daniel Ellison from Consensys who has been working on LLL and language research introduced themselves.\n\nAfri reached out to Gavin about the Yellow Paper and Gavin said he would be happy to place the Yellow Paper under a Creative Commons license. He hadn't done it yet because he has been busy, but will find time in 2 weeks to do it. The topic was brought up of the possibility of having more than 1 formal specification for Etheruem. KEVM is testable and executable so if there were to be another executable or testable specification you could check interoperability between two specifications, but currently there is a not a way to do this with the Yellow Paper. It would be possible to get a merge of the two specifications, combining elements, such as the English prose from the Yellow Paper with some of the elements of the KEVM. It isn't necessarily bad to have multiple specifications, but it would be bad to have it too fragmented. The first step for the Yellow Paper seems to be to apply a license so it can get up-to date. The KEVM team is interested in moving KEVM to Ethereum Foundation ownership.\n\n## [[57:36](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=3456)] 6. [Parity stuck ether proposals](https://paritytech.io/blog/on-classes-of-stuck-ether-and-potential-solutions-2.html).\nNo official/formal statement today, but Parity has heard the community feedback loud and clear.\n\n## [[58:27](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=3507)] 7. POA Testnet unification [Update]\nNo updates.\n\n## [[9:29](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=569)] 8. Core team updates.\n\n- Parity - Parity is replacing RocksDB with a custom database layer called ""ParityDB"". Attempts to optimize RocksDB over the last 6 months proved to not be fruitful so they are making the switch. More information on that can be found on their GitHub. We are having some problems keeping up with mainnet, but are working to fix that.\n- geth - Nick has been working some potential improvements to not write as much to disk with the idea to keep the state diffs of the last 100 or so blocks in memory (similar to Parity) which would raise memory requirements, but decreases disk I/O. geth is exploring other database solutions and so far hasn't found any silver bullet DB replacement. Although doing some optimizations like disabling the background miner would help, there are some people who rely on the ""pending state"" details that the miner enables for APIs.\n- cpp-ethereum - No major updates. Work in progress on refactoring the database layer to easily swap databases and enable optimizations. Recently implemented a script to proxy HTTP RPC request to IPC sockets in order to get rid of the HTTP server in the client. This code can be used with other clients. Improvements have been implemented in the CLI.\n- ethereum-js - No updates. Looking forward to EWASM testnet. Lots of maintencance and merging of PRs.\n- Harmony - Database layer is almost done being moved from LevelDb to RocksDB. Created a new pruning mechanism. Soon will focus on the Casper testnet.\n- pyEVM - No major updates. Getting closer to major alpha release.\n- pyethapp - No updates.\n\n**NOTE: The next core dev meeting will be January 12th due to the holidays.
