7cgma2,1510506970,Atomic Swaps and Taxation,"Looking for a serious discussion on how the tax code relating to crypto-crypto atomic swaps may or may not need to be changed once this form of decentralized exchange is more common.\n\nRight now, someone who sells their BTC for ETH is liable for taxes according to US tax law. If your transaction happened on Coinbase for example, there is a record of it on some database that may eventually be accessed by the authorities should it be necessary. Therefore you have an incentive to report this transaction and pay your taxes due. \n\nWhat should happen in the case of an atomic swap, where the token you're buying or the amount is not disclosed? What should the tax implications be when the entire transaction is decentralized? Tax certainly cannot be deducted from swaps, but it may be owed, in which case atomic swaps wouldn't make sense to execute. However since the tax jurisdiction of the owner of each address is unknown, they're bound to happen.\n\nI think this would be a forward thinking discussion on the potential real world tax disruption of decentralized technologies. Looking forward to everyone's opinions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7cgma2/atomic_swaps_and_taxation/,12,18

7cgqz8,1510508200,How does the average confirmation speed affect dApps?,"The manner in which I currently understand how dApps will utilize the blockchain leads me to conclude that many dApps would be quite notably slow - even with an increased transactional capacity per block.\n\nLet's say there's an instant messaging dApp - let's call it WhatsDapp. In order to ""send"" a message (or a collection of messages) to another user, WhatsDapp needs to transmit some transactions across the nodes, which will only be confirmed on the blockchain every 10 seconds.\n\nIf that is the case, users will only be able to reply to messages every 10 seconds, making it quite unbearably slow when compared to usual IM apps. I would imagine that WhatsDapp could update messages _before_ blocks are confirmed, and that would be instantaneous. But I suppose that some messages would have to be ""recalled"" once the valid block is found.\n\nIs my understanding right here? That most dApps could only have confidence in certain transactions only every 10 seconds?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7cgqz8/how_does_the_average_confirmation_speed_affect/,7,2
