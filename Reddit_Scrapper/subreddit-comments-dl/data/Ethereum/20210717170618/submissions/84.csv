But it's not the focus of the project, is not even started and it's on the NEO blockchain.\n\nI believe that building a reputation system will be difficult because it needs to reach critical mass in order to truly be useful. But I see it as one of the most promising use cases. I see it as something which might start with identity management, slowly evolving into a mechanism to place a score on a standardized sets of skills or topics. As the system grows, users would have economic incentives to truthfully vouch for others based on the capacity of their relationship. The network effect would make the reputation scores increasingly accurate, similarly to how PageRank uses backlinks to accurately rank websites. In the future, someone's reputation score might become it's most valuable asset, so it needs to be in a trusted system.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7h7mxb/reputation_management_on_ethereum/,8,4
