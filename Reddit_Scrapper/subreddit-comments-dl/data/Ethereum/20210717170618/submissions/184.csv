7mwm2t,1514577432,Am I being too cautious with security to factory reset my PC,"I am going to preface this by saying that I am in the minority here in that I am pretty bad with computers. I recently bought a little bit of ether and it is sitting in my coinbase right now but I want to switch it over to a wallet. I am just wondering if I should factory reset my PC before I do this. I have never gotten a virus on my PC I don't think and I only have steam and some editing software but anytime I start it up I get a weird can't download message (I think from failing to download Leauge of Legends). I don't think I have a virus but I also don't want to lose all of my ether, so should I factory reset my PC before I download a wallet and switch my money over or not.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mwm2t/am_i_being_too_cautious_with_security_to_factory/,0,16

There was a brief issue with me clicking too fast, so it did send 2 transactions through by accident (I'm fine with this and there are two different transaction IDs) but aside from that, everything was done properly.\n\nNow, to be clear, it's not that the transaction is taking this long to verify, it's that it's not even showing up in the Binance history page. This happened earlier but only took like an hour. Again, this is Ethereum, so it should be pretty quickly. Going on 2 hours?
