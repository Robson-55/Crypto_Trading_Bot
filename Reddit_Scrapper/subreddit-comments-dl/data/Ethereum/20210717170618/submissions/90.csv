Like any other contract.\n\nBut with Ether potentially having swings of 200-500% or more during the duration of the contact who would take that? Either side could lose (or get) much more then they bargained for. I just don't see how you can have a working contract with so much Volatility occurring.

7hjz2m,1512418073,"We all head of sharding, Plasma and payment channels, but what about tangles and hashgraphs as state channels on Ethereum?","State channels can be complemented with arbitrary consensus algorithms, which is what allows things like Plasma. There are many types of consensus algorithms out there and they all have strengths and weaknesses, but I haven't read much about DAG based consensus algorithms used in state channels on Ethereum. I would be very interested in seeing some people trying to implement something akin to hashgraph (or IOTA) as a state-channel consensus algorithm with on-chain settlement. \n\nThe idea would be to have users join a state-channel with funds X, run a consensus node implementing the Hashgraph (or PoW, IOTA style consensus rules) consensus protocol. Users would then exchanges messages with one another (or verify 2 transactions before sending a transaction like IOTA) and follow rules akin to the ones described in the [Hashgraph whitepaper](http://www.swirlds.com/downloads/SWIRLDS-TR-2016-01.pdf) (or IOTA's). \n\nWhat would be the benefits? Well, obviously the hashgraph is awesome for small groups that want to interact really quickly and IOTA seems great for free and reliable transfer of funds, but they can't really interact (yet) with other distributed technologies out there like Ethereum. If implemented as state-channels on Ethereum, users could move in and out of these state channels as they please very easily and interact with the rest of the awesome Ethereum ecosystem. \n\nIdeas and suggestions welcome! These could also be interesting community bounties :).\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7hjz2m/we_all_head_of_sharding_plasma_and_payment/,8,0
