It hasn't gone through almost 24hrs later. Others out there have not seen their ETH in 3 DAYS and some longer. There are reports of others losing fiat to this site. The same is happening with BTC. Not only do they have all kinds of bizarre ""trustline"" requirements, but either you can't fulfill them or even if you do it doesn't fucking help you get your coins. Their support is NON-FUCKING-EXISTENT.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THESE FUCKING THIEVES WHO REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THESE ISSUES ON TWITTER, THEY ARE PROMPTING PEOPLE TO CONTINUE USING THEIR SITE AS IF THERE ARE NO ISSUES.\n\n[FUCK GATEHUB MAN, FUCKING SCAMMERS](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=gatehub&amp;src=tyah)\n\n\nNot to mention they are trying to charge people 0.005BTC or 0.05 BTC to try and move their BTC out of wallet after its there.

7k16r1,1513359075,Transactions price is 30x higher the last few days !!,"Posted for @AltcoinsTalks (his got deleted)\n\nBefore being accused of being a cheap person, let me explain: 1- We have a crypto forum where we share with our members the tokens we collect from promoting ICOs on the site &gt; http://www.altcoinstalks.com/ 2- That means we are expected to do thousands of transactions per month. 3- That's why we obviously till recently used 0.1 gwei for sending tokens, and it worked.\n\nUntil few days ago, where it no longer did, and even with ethereum price almost doubling, the amount of gas needed per transaction is much much higher.\n\nI think this is a problem, because the etherum network powers thousands of tokens. Unlike Ethereum, most of these tokens are priced at few cents. Thus there should be a way for tokens to be traded cheap and not having transactions cost more than the tokens value.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k16r1/transactions_price_is_30x_higher_the_last_few_days/,2,5

Allowing developers to code dynamic contracts with real world input has some clear value, however a concern came to mind and I have yet to find a proposed solution.\n\nThe concern is about 'bad' code/contracts either through unintentional errors in the code, or code un-optimized in a way that adds additional strain to the network where it's not needed. A thought that I had in mind was similar to driver signing in Windows. The Ethereum foundation may have a compliance department that reviews and 'signs' code for dapps, assuring that the code is not only functioning properly, but is created by a trustworthy publisher, passing value onto users who can rest assured that they are using a verified dapp. Unverified dapps would still exist, but would allow users to proceed with an added layer of caution.\n\nOn a side note, is there a central marketplace/repository for dapps?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k1z37/smart_contract_signing/,3,3
