7vihjh,1517868781,Why We Started A Manipulation-Resistant Subreddit.,"Why r/Layer2?\n\nHave you noticed how manipulated ethereum subreddits are? We have.\n\nMods have to make a decision about how to filter posts:\n\n\n- Low touch moderation/spam filter =&gt; Subreddit front-page is dominated by upvote manipulators. See r/cryptocurrency for a successful subreddit using this strategy.\n- High touch moderation/spam filter =&gt; Subreddit front-page dominated by text-only posts but still vulnerable to manipulated outside links. (see: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7v7mnk/i_just_created_a_website_that_list_more_than_120/)\n\n\nWhile we can all agree that a front-page dominated by manipulated posts is suboptimal, what is the effect of high touch moderation? Text-only posts are great for important community discussions, but they are not suitable for all types of information. Medium posts and announcements from new and cool projects get caught in the spam filter just like everyone else, but those projects are the lifeblood of a growing community. We want a place for the community to learn about cool stuff and important news. \n\nWe call it r/Layer2. We think it compliments r/ethereum quite nicely.\n\n\nLayer2 is a subreddit focused projects that are building on top of blockchains (so ethereum stuff, mainly). It has a unique moderation system; it is token-curated. Anyone may come on the ConcourseQ discord (https://discord.gg/KPcfhpj) and suggest an article. Only Layer2-Curators may nominate suggested items for the subreddit, and only Layer2-Curators may upvote items into the feed. Once an item gets the required upvotes (3), the ConcourseQ bot (“Mistake Not…”) will transmit the item to reddit.\n\n\nTokens Rewards:\n\n\nSuggest an item that wins inclustion: +2 Qs\n\nNominate a suggest item that wins inclusion: +2 Qs\n\nNominate an original item that wins inclusion: +4 Qs\n\nUpvote a nominated item that wins inclusion: +1 Q\n\n\nWhat good are Qs:\n\nQs have no purpose yet. \n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7vihjh/why_we_started_a_manipulationresistant_subreddit/,84,30

7vjrb0,1517880026,Can't figure out how to import Mist account correctly,"So I installed Mist a few months ago and it put the Geth folder on my main drive (SSD). There is now not enough room on that drive to continue downloading the chain. I needed to upgrade Mist anyways so I went and downloaded the latest version. This install actually let me choose the Geth directory so I put it on my HDD with plenty of room. I moved my key from the keystore into the keystore of the new folder.  \n  \nI still couldn't see my account when running mist. Luckily if I run my old Mist on the old chaindata, I can see that it's still there and it still has all my ether in it.  \n  \nI thought maybe I could run geth and point it at the new folder using datadir=""new path"", but that hasn't worked.  \n  \nIf I click Add Account I can actually see my old account in the list to add, but when I click Authorize it just closes.  \n  \nI'm really frustrated and at a loss as to what to do. Does anyone have any idea what's happening here? Is it because the new Mist version can't authorize the keyfile from the old Mist version?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7vjrb0/cant_figure_out_how_to_import_mist_account/,0,0
