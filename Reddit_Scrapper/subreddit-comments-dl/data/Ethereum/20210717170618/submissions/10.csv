If it has though, I'd appreciate being pointed there. If not, here's my question; how does Ethereum handle conflict resolution?\n\nI know that the underlying tech essentially uses Merkle Trees but with thousands of nodes, how does everyone agree on which is the right transaction? \n\nAnd more specifically, what happens when 2 correct transactions are both recorded on the same leaf by different nodes? I.e. assuming we have 2 nodes A and B and leaves A.1 = B.1 but A.2 != B.2 yet both A.2 and B.2 are correct. How do they decide which leaf to update and which leaf to become A.3/B.3?\n\nAnd how is this being processed in a manner that there isn't an insane amount of backlog? With thousands of transactions happening every second, wouldn't conflict resolution limit the rate at which new transactions are created?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7axivb/how_does_ethereum_handle_conflict_resolution/,13,12

7azr3k,1509910725,Existing Research on Staking vs Gas,"Since the world is now obsessed with staking and slashing, I thought I would pose this idea and see if there was existing research on it. This is a bit of a brain dump and I obviously haven't though it through, but that is why I'm hoping someone is aware of what other people have explored this. \n\nOne of the hinderances to using Etherum is paying gas - you always have to have funds and spend money to interact with the network. \n\nOf course, gas is a useful property to make attacking the network expensive, and solves the halting problem, but I'm interested in whether or not there is an effective variation of the current gas model which gives us better usability while being close enough to providing the same security.\n\nHere is the idea:\n\n1. The holder of a private key can stake ETH into a contract in a similar vein as we see in Casper PoS.\n2. When interacting with the network gas is calculated as normal.\n3. If the 'From' address on the transaction has ETH staked, no gas is charged, as long as the cumulative gas used within an epoch is less than the staked gas. If it has no ETH staked, or has used more cumulative gas used within the epoch, gas is charged as normal (possibly from the stake, or the user has to be aware they need to provide gas, and if they don't, their transaction is failed).\n\nThis does pose a risk - An attacker could stake X ETH and attack then network using up to X/min_gas_price each epoch.\n\nTo combat that, validators could signal that an address was attacking the network, and if 2/3 validators agreed, the stake would be slashed. This does have the downside that others can punish you, and possibly collude against an entity that they don't like to constantly slash them.\n\nOf course, staking would be completely voluntary, and users could continue to pay gas instead, but it may be beneficial for large companies to stake rather than pay gas. This can also be seen as a variation of 'contract pays for gas' if you instead stake on behalf of a contract.\n\nThis does open the question on why a miner would include a transaction from an address with a 'gas stake' since they wouldn't receive a fee. I suspect this question will be much easier to answer post-Casper being deployed.\n\nThis model could also lead to other ideas such as removing the idea of gas altogether. \n\nIn a world where we have Casper, rather than having a single validator create a block at any given time, all validators could vote on transactions to include in a block. Rather than counting gas, the EVM would detect when a contract was misbehaving (maybe its taking too long to execute based on wall clock time). Of course, some validators may run a transaction and it takes 3 seconds due to a machine-level issue, while others may run it in 100ms. As long as &gt; 2/3 of validators say a transaction wasn't misbehaving and vote for its inclusion in a block, the other nodes could simply update their state based on the latest finalized block and not run the contract that isn't functional on their machine.\n\nThe voting idea is interesting to me since it may allow a decentralized set of validators to vote on transaction ordering and eliminate miner front-running, though that would currently be a bit too chatty without some major protocol changes.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7azr3k/existing_research_on_staking_vs_gas/,1,0
