7wnepy,1518289337,I made a repository with security bugs demonstrated using Truffle Mocha tests (and their fixes),"Hi guys,\n\nI made this repository:\n\nhttps://github.com/fergarrui/ethereum-security\n\nWhere I created Solidity contracts that are vulnerable to the most common security bugs. \nI saw there are other repositories similar to this one, but I am also implementing a test for every security bug. I used Truffle, so the tests can be run on Testrpc, Ganache or wherever you want.\n\nAs you can see in the readme, currently, I have these bugs implemented:\n\n* Overflow\n* Underflow\n* Reentrancy (DAO hack)\n* Delegatecall (Parity hack style)\n* DOS (e.g. stay as an Auction leader forever)\n* Force ether (relying on the invariant this.balance == 0)\n* Tx.origin\n\nUnder the contracts/ folder, you can see the vulnerable and fixed contract.\nUnder the test/&lt;specific_bug&gt; folders, you can see the tests written in JS using Mocha (vulnerable &amp; fixed). Some key steps are commented for a better understanding.\nIf you, for example, run the tests using Testrpc, you can see the TX hashes of every transaction, so you can debug them step by step for an in deep inspection.\n\nHope you like it!\nI want to keep updating it, so any question, suggestion of improvement would be really appreciated!\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wnepy/i_made_a_repository_with_security_bugs/,17,7

I've been watching a few videos on how to create a token (just for fun). In its most basic guise, it seems that you just copy and paste the smart contract code, then modify it to include the name, abbreviation, number of decimals, and token supply for your token. \n\nI'm unsure as to which code is the most up-to-date. The Ethereum website has a number of code sections (https://www.ethereum.org/token) while I also found this (apparently more recent) version on Pastebin (https://pastebin.com/nYPnuhTm).\n\nCan anyone please suggest the location of token creation code that I can play with.
