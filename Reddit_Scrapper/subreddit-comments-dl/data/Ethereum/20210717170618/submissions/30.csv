7ch6mv,1510512236,Re. contract correctness,"Noether is a research PL, which has sub-languages, in decreasing order of safety (symmetry).   \n\nI thought the concept might inspire the design of future contract languages, such as to allow various ""safety layers"" for different levels of coders/applications.   \nA contract written in a safer layer, will require less verification effort, and enable the community to trust it more.   \n\nI'm by no means knowledgeable to answer questions regarding this, but hopefully you'll find this interesting.   \n\nResources:   \n[Slides](https://tahoe-lafs.org/~davidsarah/noether-friam4.pdf)   \n[Presentation](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/noether)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ch6mv/re_contract_correctness/,5,1
