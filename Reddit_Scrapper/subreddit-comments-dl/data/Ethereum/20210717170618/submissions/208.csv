7oe7ww,1515185631,Don Tapscott mentions Grid+,"Here's a clip from Don Tapscott's latest article.\n\nFor those who don't know him he's a top 5 influencer in the cryptocurrency/blockchain space, and the reason I - and many others I'm sure - got into blockchain in the first place. \n\n**The social impact—breakthroughs on energy and climate change**\n\nThere are many use-cases poised for big growth in 2018. However, the killer app for blockchain may be saving the planet, literally. It’s time for deployment of distributed energy and peer-to-peer trading of energy tokens generated from sustainable sources—including off the grid. In November, I gave the opening speech at global electrical energy conference BIXPO 2017 in Gwangju, Korea and was amazed at blockchain initiatives by Korean power utility Kepko. Companies such as Spectral Energy in The Netherlands and LO3 Energy and Grid+ in the USA are leading the way.\n\nBlockchain + Smart Contracts will enable new enterprises to engage everyone in living more sustainably. Tokenized carbon credits will be transacted through smart contracts at marketplaces like Veridium. I see companies like CarbonX Personal Carbon Trading and Zerofootprint Software enabling and rewarding individuals to manage their personal carbon footprint. And I see enterprises balancing excess carbon emissions throughout their supply chains to create carbon neutrality in the manufacturing of products and services.\n\n\n**Full article:**\n\nhttps://qz.com/1171977/ten-2018-predictions-from-the-founder-of-the-blockchain-research-institute/",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7oe7ww/don_tapscott_mentions_grid/,10,1

7oej19,1515188253,Hello Everybody!! I'm so excited to get into the world of Ethereum!!!,"I've been aware of cryptocurrencies for many years now (initially through friends who used bitcoin back in 2011 to purchase substances from Silk Road), but never really felt a strong pull to get into cryptos. I definitely loved the idea of decentralized currency, but in its current iteration - it just didn't feel right for me. (I will say though that I did pick up some DOGE in 2014, though that was more because such wow than anything else)\n\nFast forward to a year or two ago, I remember reading a long article about Ethereum in a music magazine I came across (I'm a music producer + live looper). The article got into smart contracts and how that can affect the music industry moving forward. The whole concept fascinated me! It was the first time that I really understood the potential for blockchain technology, and I found myself really excited about this world in a way I never had been before. I was planning on learning more and getting deeper into Ethereum then, but life got a little hectic with some unexpected surprises and I completely lost touch with the cryptocurrency world.\n\nAs of 3 weeks ago, my life has finally chilled out for the first time in a very long time - and I've spent the past couple weeks reading up on cider making (I'm fermenting my first couple batches of cider right now!) and cryptocurrencies. It seems pretty clear to me that Ethereum is 100% where the magic is, and I'm excited to say that I bought my first tiny bit of Ether.\n\nI'm also really blown away by the EVM concept... who came up with that?!?! That's pretty frickin' incredible!!! This is seriously next level computing, and I can see why there's such a vibrant community around this project. I'm excited to be part of it, and am looking forward to seeing where this all evolves. :)\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this!! :D Thanks also for being such a welcoming community!! It's been a real pleasure to poke around this subreddit in the past week or two. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7oej19/hello_everybody_im_so_excited_to_get_into_the/,73,31

7oendi,1515189295,Looking for advice on coding,"Hi so I’m here for some advice. My end game goal is to learn solidity. Maybe one day work with the eth dev team or do smart contracts etc. \n\nI’m looking into learning JavaScript to start out and ive been researching boot camps and I came across devmountain. I really like them because they have free housing which is a huge deal for me and they are half the cost of something like galvanize. \n\nHowever devmountain only offers this: web dev, user-experience design, iOS dev, sales force dev, and software QA. \n\nI’ve researched in google and YT but I’m not finding good info. Probably because I’m green and don’t even know the right questions to ask. (Idk of those courses listed above are heavy in java script or not)\nCan I get some tips and advice on all of this? I have some spending money if it’s a worthy investment (education) but not on college (I’m a drop out and dislike that system) I’m only 21 and have no obligations. \n\nI realize it all takes time but I feel like the boot camp could also help me to get a good job where I can then have a base line of coding skills to learn solidity in my free time. \n\nEDIT: my learning preferences are visual and in person. I’ve taken online classes and was very bored by them and it was hard to focus on even though for some of those online classes the subject itself was very interesting to me.
