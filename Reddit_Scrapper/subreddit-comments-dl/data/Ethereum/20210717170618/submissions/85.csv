7h9kl9,1512306823,Question about smart contract,"After some days reading, it still bugs me on how a Dapp work. My example:\n\nAlice wants to sell a house, Bob wants to buy a house. A smart contract is created to serve this trade.\n\nSo Iâ€™ll start telling how I understand this contract and the flaws that I couldnâ€™t  understand. \n1. Bob sends money, Alice sends ownership token to the contract through functions like sendToken(), sendMoney(). \n2. The contract wait until both send their properties for trade, then the contract will trigger the functions trade(), giving Bob the ownership token and Alice money.\n3. The contract ended.\n\nHere are my questions:\n1. How a real world property ownership can be injected to the function sendToken()? If the answer is the trusted oracle then this oracle can team up with Alice and scam Bob (even the chance is rare tho)\n2. What to prove that Bob own the new house when all he got is a digital token? Does government protect this kind of ownership now, or soon?\n\nThe advantages of Dapp I can see are:\n1. The money canâ€™t vanish due to bankruptcy, escrow scam, disaster, hacker (maybe but real hard).\n2. Saving money, time for paperwork involved.\n3. Traceable, viewable activities inside a contract publicly.\n*Of course when the Oracle does its job properly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7h9kl9/question_about_smart_contract/,6,2
