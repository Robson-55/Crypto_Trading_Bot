7u3iik,1517340039,New ÐApp: DWorld! Trade the Earth,"Hey all! I'm excited to see this new app go live, where you can own parts of a digital Earth. Super interesting to see more fun angles on blockchain-for-digital-scarcity. In the creators' words:\n\nIn [ÐWorld](https://dworld.io) the entire world map has been divided into individual plots. Claim your place and customize it to your heart's content. Each plot on the map is owned by you; no one else can claim it or take it from you, as your plots are stored on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nYou can highlight a place of significance to you, promote your groups and advertise your businesses, or have fun trading prominent places by selling or renting out your plots. You decide on the price.\n\nTo play, you need a browser able to interact with the Ethereum network. The easiest way to do so is to use MetaMask for Chrome or Firefox.\n\nFull disclosure, I know one of the creators, so I'll have them check the comments here. Try it out and let them know your thoughts!\n\n[https://dworld.io](https://dworld.io)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7u3iik/new_ðapp_dworld_trade_the_earth/,1,6
