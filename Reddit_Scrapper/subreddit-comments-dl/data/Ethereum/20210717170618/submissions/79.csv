7grxrq,1512096291,"Is it possible to create a ""master"" wallet containing ETH, while having ""sub-wallets"" containing ERC20 tokens that utilize the master wallet's ETH for paying gas?","Hello all. I'm doing a bit of research, and I wanted to know if it was possible to somehow create a single master wallet, that contains ETH (and ERC20 tokens/contracts), while having multiple subwallets, that contain ERC20 tokens that do NOT contain ETH. \n\nI'd like to store all the ETH in the master wallet, so I don't have to distribute ETH to each individual public keys/wallets in case I want to transfer the ERC20 tokens. \n\nAssume that I'm a dad, and have 5 children. I want to distribute something like OMG to my 5 children's wallets/public keys, but I want to be the holder of ETH, so I don't have to distribute ETH to their own wallets, since gas costs can vary from day to day, and I wouldn't want to manage all that.\n\nThoughts?

Create viruses that are undetactable for months that sit there collecting information.\n2. Get root CAs which allow impersonation of SSL websites and OS drivers.\n3. Use multiple Zero Day hacks to create viruses that spread like wildfire and don't require a user to do anything wrong.\n4. Infiltrate market leading companies and modify hardware provided to customers.\n5. Jump air gaps in many ways\n6. Infiltrate a highly secure airgapped nuclear facility and destroy centrifuges without nuclear scienticts figuring out what was happening.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Do we really think our Nano Ledgers will stand up against a state sponsored attack?\n2. Are our air gapped stashes really as secure as we think? Can we trust that our hardware wasn't tampered with?\n3. How will the average Joe be able to be their own bank and securely interact with blockchains that hold their degrees, IDs, etc.\n4. Will Vitalik and Vlad's bleeding edge crypto efforts withstand state sponsored sabotage over a period of years?\n\nThe future of the blockchain is about much more than our crypto holdings. \n\n1.

7guhae,1512128760,Disappointment with Tokens as of late,"I'm sure I am not the only one who sees the problem with every new Ethereum project requiring its own token. It is simply too much and doesn't make blockchain better. 90% of whitepapers I read today could accomplish the exact same thing with Ether or USDT. Now, there are absolutely certain projects that require its own token but like I mentioned 90% absolutely do not.\n\n\nTokens are hindering the adoption of Ethereum as a platform, can you imagine having to pay for everything in some different kind of coin? I fear we end up in a society like this.\n\nYou wake up and you go to eat breakfast but realize that your out of milk so you go to the store. At the store you go to pay and find out they only accept **BreadCoin** their own currency, but thats fine you open your smart phone and go to your cryptobank account to buy some **BreadCoin**. Only issue is your cryptobank stores all your money in **BankCoin** and doesnt offer **BreadCoin** so you need to buy **ExchangeCoin** to turn your **BankCoins** into **BreadCoins**. \n\n\nEverything works fine and youre on your way home but run out of gas so you stop at the gas station and pay using **GasCoin**. Then your landlord says you owe rent so you go to transfer money but you don't have **RentCoin**. You then spend 10 minutes transferring all your other coins into **RentCoin** and send it through their ""express lane network"" that requires an **ExpressToken** to send money faster.\n\n\nYou shrug it off and get into your car and turn on the music to wind down, then you find out your streaming music service ran out of **MusicCoins** so you need to buy more music coin to continue your subscription.\n\n\nNow before you go on about straw-man argument or snowballing, you have to see my point. Having a dozen different tokens and currency each with volatile prices is not conductive to a health block chain environment.\n\nEvery new project doesn't realize tech companies thrived without ICOs and there are other ways to raise money and generate revenue that doesn't involve creating a new shitcoin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7guhae/disappointment_with_tokens_as_of_late/,0,5
