7lx1do,1514144514,A Christmas Mystery: sweepers and zero gas price transactions,"For the last couple weeks I've been following some accounts that have a bunch of old brainwallet keys and compete with each other to steal ether that is continually deposited into accounts, either via mistake or misconfiguration. I've seen them mentioned once or twice, usually by /u/rya_nc in regards to the empty password parity account: \n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x00a329c0648769a73afac7f9381e08fb43dbea72\n\nThere's not a ton of information about this practice out there, but much of it is related to BTC rather than ETH, but I've heard them referred to as sweepers as they sweep deposited funds out of accounts as fast as they can.\n\nYou can see in the brainwallet for '' (as in no password) that a few different accounts compete for the funds that are deposited here. One of the common addresses you can find is [0x957cD4Ff9b3894FC78b5134A8DC72b032fFbC464](https://etherscan.io/address/0x957cd4ff9b3894fc78b5134a8dc72b032ffbc464) which I'll refer to here as 957.\n\nNow, 957 has been quite lucrative in this endeavor, collecting something like $23M in ethereum and $900k in tokens over two years.\n\nNot too unusual up until this point, plenty of sweepers do the same thing (most not nearly to the same success rate) and make a good amount of cash stealing from people who make mistakes.\n\nBut all this competition between sweepers leads to some interesting situations like in the case of this empty password brainwallet account, which has a supply of $13k worth of minereum tokens and a private key that anyone can look up.\n\n[minereum (MNE) ERC20 Token Tracker](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a95b271b0535d15fa49932daba31ba612b52946?a=0x00a329c0648769a73afac7f9381e08fb43dbea72)\n\nHowever, since any transactions to this account are quickly swept away, it's impossible to send enough gas for a token transfer because it's gone nearly as fast as it arrives - usually within two blocks.\n\nIt's fascinating to see some money locked in the blockchain not because of an address mistake (which is a fairly regular occurrence), but because of the collective actions of a bunch of people interacting with the chain.\n\n## A Minereum Mystery\nSo I check this account relatively frequently to see how the various players are doing and the other day I was surprised to notice that some of the minereum that I thought was locked in this account was leaving this account and headed to 957, like this one:\n\n[Ethereum Transaction 0xb1050b324f02e9a0112e0ec052b57013c16156301fa7c894ebf2f80ac351ac22](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1050b324f02e9a0112e0ec052b57013c16156301fa7c894ebf2f80ac351ac22)\n\nThis was immediately interesting as this minereum was supposed to be untouchable in this account. How was 957 removing it?\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear but it appears that 957 had submitted a few transactions with a normal gas limit but zero gas price, meaning there's zero tx gas cost and the transfer can be included in blocks even though there's no gas to pay for it.\n\nBut since there's no gas associated with the transaction, there's  no conceivable reason why a miner would include such a transaction in one of their mined blocks. You might know this if you've tried to buy or interact with a cryptokitty recently and your gas price was set too low - you probably wait a long time for your transaction to be included. But these zero gas price transactions were being included immediately in a block.\n\nThat was fascinating - how did these transactions get included in the chain?\n\n## Sweeps Become Miners\n\nThe mystery started to reveal itself when I realized that all of these zero gas price transactions have been included in blocks mined by 0xE4E359702A4Ab1F9C7b2f1A4da8064492eC1D41A, a miner that has been operating for the last 11 days:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xe4e359702a4ab1f9c7b2f1a4da8064492ec1d41a#mine\n\nPresumably 957 had the brilliant idea that they could include whatever transactions they wanted if they only had access to a mining pool. And with $23M in the bank, why not buy your own pool?\n\nThere are payments made to Genesis from this account so it seems reasonable that this is paying for a cloud miner but I'm not familiar enough with the setups of cloud miners to understand how one can decide to include zero gas price transactions in their own.\n\nSo 957 waits for their GPUs to mine a block, and immediately adds ~5 zero gas price transactions to the normal selection of txpool transactions picked up by their node, sweeping tokens to the 957 account and submitting it normally.\n\n957 also uses this opportunity to move funds out of accounts where the balance is low enough that it doesn't make sense to pay a tx fee to move that low amount otherwise. Yes, it might not be worth it for a single transaction, but if you've got enough of these accounts with $5 in them then it can accumulate over time and add up to real money. Or at least they think so. Here's one of these low value with zero gas price transactions:\n\n[Ethereum Transaction 0x9506fc85ab3836744025a41dfe66076d53a10d70b9f2008cbfc4eb1bbb393820](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9506fc85ab3836744025a41dfe66076d53a10d70b9f2008cbfc4eb1bbb393820)\n\nCloud mining may be barely break even normally, but with the extra bonus of trapped tokens and these accounts with very low amounts on top, paying someone to host hardware to mine ethereum might actually be worth it for 957.\n\n---\n\nI find these sorts of meta-games inside of a system that isn't designed specifically for them very interesting, and after watching for a while I finally felt like I had enough information to put something together describing what's going on.\n\nI'll keep watching, of course, for continuing developments. There are still a lot of interesting angles to explore here. Here are some of the questions I still have about the process. If you've got theories, please chime in!\n\n* Why does 957 make these tiny transactions to pull 3 minereum at a time from these accounts with no gas price? Could they not include all 30k minereum at once from accounts like this: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5b5b9f1cbc0062c61ab73577e02301c07f5b66fa#tokentxns\n* I've never seen anyone sweep any ether away in less than two blocks time, i.e. eth is sent as part of block 4700000 and then is taken in a tx as part of block 4700002. I'm guessing that there's something about the details of how the txpool works that prevents this from happening in one block but I'd be curious to know what that actually is.\n* Zero gas price is a weird thing for the network to tolerate - does this make sense in some cases or is this something that should be disallowed on the network?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lx1do/a_christmas_mystery_sweepers_and_zero_gas_price/,315,36
