7mhvvz,1514409650,Aren't transaction fees a disincentive to build Dapps?,"Thinking of areas where Dapps could be really useful - specifically gaming and I can't help but feel like the transaction fees put a massive overhead onto the game developer.\n\nFor example, each time the game wishes to do the following a transaction feel will be incurred:\n- Store / Update player stats on the blockchain (win / loss records)\n- Loot drops added to player inventory\n- Soft currency added to player balance (could be just 5-10 coins of a really worthless currency)\n- New item crafted\netc.\n\nAm I missing something? Where would the developer be able to recoup these fees? Imagine just the transaction for collecting soft currency alone. Say in a diablo type game, this could happen hundreds of times within an hour for a single player.\n\nAny tips or thoughts on how to remove these disincentives so that we can make some really cool stuff?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mhvvz/arent_transaction_fees_a_disincentive_to_build/,11,30

Let's discuss!,I never really thought about it even thought I had some lectures about it at the university (shame on me). It really seems important to me to consider those topics when creating a voting system on the blockchain otherwise it could be possible that in the end nobody votes or even everyone just dumps their coins because of a lack of incentive surrounding the whole voting process.

7mk62t,1514433187,Questions on Sharding FAQ,"https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ\n\nQuestions\n\n1. Why would each block need a collation for each shard?  Why not keep shard state root in the mempool and allow shard collations to be sparsely allocated across blocks?  i.e. shards can generate collations at any cadence up to and even beyond (multiple collations per block) the full cadence of the root blockchain.  In a network partition some shards will keep working and others will not be able to reach a 2/3 collation majority.  Why stall the whole chain?  Why require matching cadence for all shards?\n2. Why do we need validators to validate the transactions in the collation?  Do we not trust the collator signatures?  You just said random selection gives us reliably honest collator pools.\n2b. Correlary: Are Super Full Nodes necessary?  Implies such a node has O(c)^2...\n3. What is the incentive for validator nodes?  It seems plausible that they will have to expend significant energy over a long period of time with 0 reward (i.e. until the network is attacked).\n4. There is a lot of hand waving about the registration, selection &amp; rotation process for collators and validators.  Can you actually spell this out?  \n5. You mention 150 ""nodes"" as a small selection.  How do you bootstrap such a system starting from 0 nodes?\n6. You suggest challenge-response but this undermines any sense of finality.\n7. You suggest instant shuffling but also mention that stateless validation is not really possible in a pure form and will potentially degrade significantly for certain heavy-state application workloads.  How do we ensure a usable outcome which cannot be attacked by high-state transaction spam? \n8. Shard security model:  can we turn this on its head?  What if we have N shards and N*k nodes and a mining pool controls X% of nodes and we do ""instant"" shuffling every Z seconds, how long until the miner controls 2/3 of a shard's validator and steals everything in it?  You may have 99.9999998 with one shuffling, but if you are re-rolling the dice frequently, the miner will eventually get a chance to steal.\n9.
