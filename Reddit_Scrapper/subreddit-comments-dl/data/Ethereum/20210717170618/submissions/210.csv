Is there anyway besides (1) googling for what ever comes up the most (cough cough, cryptokitties), (2) going to [gas station](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php) and seeing whether a name is listed in the top past 1500 transactions, or (3) going to [stateofdapp](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/tab/most-viewed) and just trying out stuff only to realize the dapp your trying out seems super low (or zero) user activity. \n\nAny input appreciated, thx.  \n\nedit: changed ""apps"" to ""dapps"", old habits die hard",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ohxly/how_to_determine_actual_user_usage_of_the_most/,7,1

7oiece,1515231948,I had trouble understanding gas/gas price/gas limit so I tried to make an own explanation. Thanks for checking and correcting (including language).,"Operations on the Ethereum world computer do cost more or less ""gas"", depending on the complexity of the operation. For example, a simple ETH transaction costs 21,000 gas. If you are a pro and want to perform more complex operations, you may find yourself in a situation, where you can't say for sure how much gas your operation will actually consume. Therefore, you can specify a ""gas limit"". With that, your operation will start to be executed, but it will stop in case your specified limit should be reached - which might save you a lot of money. For a normal transaction this means: It doesn't matter if you set the gas limit to 50,000 or 100,000 - the limit just has to be at least 21,000. Now you should ask: ""Ok, but how can I pay more, so that my transaction is executed quicker?"" By setting a higher ""gas price"": The miners will get all the gas that your operation consumes, but YOU decide how much ETH every single gas is worth! Example: You set the gas price of a normal transaction to 0.00000005 ETH per gas. Now you can calculate your actual transaction fee by multiplying 0,00000005 ETH per gas * 21,000 gas = 0,00105 ETH.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7oiece/i_had_trouble_understanding_gasgas_pricegas_limit/,40,21

7ojhgu,1515248551,Ethereum Blockchain is Global virtual Real Estate. What is the role of My Ether Wallet in the Ecosystem? A simple Futurama metaphor to understand it all.,"Recently I've seen questions regarding ""How are ethers and tokens stored?""  What is the role of My Ether Wallet in the ecosystem. What happens if MEW (My Ether Wallet) or others alike disappear?\n\nI want to share a couple metaphors, which helped me understand the blockchain, in case anyone else might find it useful.\n\n## Ethereum Blockchain == The World\nI think it's easiest to just imagine the Ethereum Blockchain as a world, just like ours. We have all types of beings living in this world: *real humans, autonomous robots and even the guaranteed Internet kitties.*\n\n***You own a piece of real estate (a house) in this Ethereum world.***\n\nThe **private key** is the *key to the house*.\nThe **public key** is the *address to the house*.\n\nAll ether and tokens are stored in this house. **Always.**\n\nI think this important to understand, because this is quite different from how we use ""money"" right now. When you leave your house, you might bring your wallet with you, which contains cash, loose change, gift cards and debit cards. *No more credit cards - at the moment at least.*\n\nFor all intents and purposes the only thing you can bring, when traveling away from the house, is a debit card (and maybe gift cards). No more cash and loose change.\n\nImagine we live in the year 3,000 - it look's exactly like Futurama. Tubes. Transport Tubes everywhere. You step into a transport tube and *swooof* you get whisked away. If Futurama isn't your cup of tea, think Jetsons.\n\n[Futurama Transport Tube Reference](https://images.moviepilot.com/images/c_limit,q_auto:good,w_600/ocgvrrkusigkmjrnkjkj/can-you-travel-the-tube-futurama-style.jpg)\n\nLet's imagine your house, located in the Ethereum ecosystem, also has a transport tube attached to it.\n\nWhenever you sign a transaction (kind of like a debit card) with your private key (they key to your house) a ether/token is moved from the safety deposit box and into the transport tube, attached to the house. Which, as we all know, is not reversible. You put something into the transport tube and it's headed for the final destination. \n\nIn other words, when ever you are initiating a transaction (kind of like a debit card), whether it's at the grocery store or buying that flashy new Tesla, ethers/tokens are transferred from your house to the final destination using the transport tubes (like in Futurama).\n\nSimply put, ethers/tokens are moved from 1 piece of real estate (your house) to another (maybe several - depending on smart contract), whenever a transaction is initiated.\n\n### Wallets == House Doors\nIn other words, My Ether Wallet or any wallet for that matter is only the door to your house. It's not your house. But remember, the wrong door manufacturer might create a replica of the private key when entering your house... Robbing you of all valuable possessions. Falsely providing the illusion they were the house to begin with.\n\nYou have a piece of real estate (probably a house, maybe a mansion) on the blockchain. Your private key lets you open the door to that house.\n\nMy Ether Wallet is the really sexy door attached to your house.\n\nIt provides a simple way to get in/out of the house.\n\nMEW also comes with the added benefit of watching for scammy door manufacturers. in case some ~~hackers~~ scammers try to replace your door, while you aren't looking.\n\n### Centralized Exchange == Town House in Gated Community\nHowever, sending it to an exchange is like moving properties, using a gated entrance, with a security guard, to enter your town house.\n\nIt's up to you if you trust the security or not of this supposedly ""gated"" community. Maybe they have a gate but no fences surrounding the property...\n\nAlso, all mail goes through the gated community mail center. So for example if there is an airdrop (sending tokens via mail) the exchange may or may not forward that mail your house.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ojhgu/ethereum_blockchain_is_global_virtual_real_estate/,32,3
