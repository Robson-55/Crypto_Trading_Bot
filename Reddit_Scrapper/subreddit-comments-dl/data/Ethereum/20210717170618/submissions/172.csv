7m4aow,1514244529,Thought of an idea for a cash style crypto method to scale transactions as fast as punching cash through a register (no token necessary),Basically the idea is to have a contract wallet (keys are not known to anyone) where you send any amount either slightly over what you plan to pay at the counter or way above if you're prone to splurge. In return you are given a one time contract link or qr code. When the total at the counter is rung through they scan the qr code or type the link and enter their address through their kiosk via copy paste or w/e. As a contract address you won't be able to double spend funds as the only way to access them is to use the one time access qr code link and withdraw the funds through a delayed offline transaction. If you want to get your eth or token back you simply follow the same process as if you were accepting the payment. Not a developer so if this doesn't work please disappoint me in the comments \n\nedit: forgot to mention any extra funds after payment are refunded to og address or a designated refund address,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7m4aow/thought_of_an_idea_for_a_cash_style_crypto_method/,4,5
