Sadly banks are much better solution and centralization seems better if we don't have a solution for this things.\n\nThis is not only about ethereum but thinking eth as forefront of this whole blockchain movement and expecting a solution from this community first.\nSo please discuss if this interests you.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7me3w2/ethereum_will_build_a_paranoid_society/,0,21
