7uhbls,1517472981,PSA: Using MetaMask Recovery Seed,"Short Story\n\nYesterday I clicked on my MetaMask wallet on Google Chrome and it had prompted me to create a new account as if I had never had an account.\n\nGreat, MetaMask is glitching. No worries though, I have my seed phrase saved. Keep in mind I have multiple wallets within the same account (aka ""Den""). After recovering my account with the seed phrase only one wallet titled ""Account 1"" was created. It had my cryptocurrencies associated with my first wallet but where were my other wallets?\n\nI figured MetaMask just needed some time to sync everything. After waiting for awhile, my other wallets had not appeared. As you can imagine I became very nervous.\n\nAfter some Googling, I found out that when you recover your MetaMask wallet using the seed phrase, to recover the other wallets, you need to create a new wallet for every additional wallet you had before. Phew. Sharing this so others won't have to deal with the stress I had to deal with.\n\nTLDR: When recovering a MetaMask account with multiple wallets using the seed phrase, for every additional wallet you originally had, you'll need to create a new wallet. For example, if you had 4 wallets, after recovering your ""Den"", you'll need to create 3 new wallets.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7uhbls/psa_using_metamask_recovery_seed/,14,9

7uhj7t,1517476158,Trying to understand smart contract execution and storage,"1. When I make a contract call, how / where is it actually executed? I understand that a contract call is nothing more than a transaction containing the function to execute and eventually some data. Does the miner mining my transaction execute the function or how is the acutal code processed?\n\n2. Where is the contract storage? Let's assume my contract does nothing more than holding a variable x that initializes to zero. Now I'm calling the contract's only function 'increment()' that should change x to one. How is x being changed and where is it (physically) stored?
