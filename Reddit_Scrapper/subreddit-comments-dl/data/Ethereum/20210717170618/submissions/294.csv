7tt22g,1517240011,Why does Ethereum need a different type of browser?,"Hi everyone! I'm very excited about Ethereum and dapps but I am unsure as to why Ethereum needs a new/different type of browser, such as the Mist client. \n\n* Do Mist and other Ethereum browsers only provide the additional capability of interacting with dapps?\n * If so, why is this required? Could a browser extension for Chrome/Firefox perform the same functionality? Can someone provide an example of how the Mist browser would interact with a dapp that a modern browser cannot?\n* Do the Ethereum browsers provide me with a way of interacting with my Ethereum funds directly through the browser without the act of inputting my information? \n * If that's the case, isn't this a security risk?\n\n\nSorry if these are stupid questions, I spent a while Googling around but didn't find much info on the features these browsers provide. Thanks for any info anyone provides. \n\nedit: thanks everyone! great responses. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7tt22g/why_does_ethereum_need_a_different_type_of_browser/,16,10
