7kkf19,1513592944,Community funds,"Hey,\n\nI've been dreaming of online communities playing with money together for a long while now and I feel like Ethereum could offer tools for making it a reality. Something akin to communal multisig wallets but more feature rich. It'd surely create in your community a lot of drama and probably have catastrophic consequences but some things are worth some risk!\n\nHow would one proceed about creating a cryptocurrency fund where participants can have:  \n-Weighted voting rights  \n-Configurable spending limits  \n-What else?  \nFor example: members of an online community seed a smart contract with funds and are given voting rights based on some agreed upon principle. There needs to be ability to register new members and also kick out old members, all which are things that require voting. Members can create proposals with a variety of configurable values including amount of funds requested, data concerning the proposal, time bound values eg. out of the x amount of funds given only y amount can be withdrawn before time z.  \nSo let's say a member creates a proposal to buy 10 games for the community to use, inputting into the data field the necessary details about how the games will be acquired, stored and distributed. It then will be voted on by the community which of course will have it's own communication channels for discussion, the proposal can go through phases of editing before a final agreement is reached and then the funds are assigned as agreed upon and then either the games are bought and distributed or stored as agreed upon or else a vote to punish the members failure to deliver by kicking him/her out of the fund is had.\n\n\nIf this could be made into a platform where you can easily roll out community funds without having to code everything from scratch I think it'd probably see some use as a dapp too, there's probably ways to profit from it too!\n\nI know there's Aragon but it's not live yet afaik? and it seems to be suited for more complex organizations in design, I think this could be done with a much simpler platform. But any ideas are welcome!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7kkf19/community_funds/,18,2
