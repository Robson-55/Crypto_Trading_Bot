Maybe have a public chatroom as well that also displays each users address/balance just for the hell of it. Messages would be stored in a regular database rather than a smart contract so it's instant and no fees.

Sharing our first comprehensive article on the Coinbase &amp; Gemini 1099-K. Would love your input on ANY other topics or questions! :),"Hi /r/Ethereum! Thank you for reading this. \n\nI felt the world of digital currencies is a bit too uncertain, so I want to do what I can to create more confidence and certainty! Please let me know if you have any questions or comments (I'll probably respond to every comment here!)\n\n&gt; [**Check out our first comprehensive article on the Coinbase / Gemini 1099-K**](https://www.cointaxes.com/1099)\n\n&gt; **Some ""fun"" facts you may not know about digital currency taxes**\n\nHere's two quick ""fun"" facts you may not know. We will be posting in-depth articles on these, too. [Consider subscribing to our newsletter to hear first when they've been published!](https://cointaxes.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ffa9bb9a681d0dcb59dcbf2cb&amp;id=06ed9ffdd3)\n\n* **Non-deductible personal loss:** You should never exchange your digital currency directly for ANY goods or services. If you happen to have a loss on that trade, it will be non-deductable as capital gains losses ONLY apply to ""investment"" not ""personal use"" activity.  You can read more about this on [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/01/03/what-you-should-know-about-taxation-of-cryptocurrencies/#523290821346), [Time](http://time.com/money/5007068/theres-a-huge-hidden-bitcoin-tax-that-you-need-to-know-about/) and the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409).\n\n* **FBAR requirements:** This isn't explicitly tax related, actually, but a LOT of my US friends do not know about this important filing. If you *ever* on a single day, even, held $10,000 USD worth of value overseas (Binance, for example), you must meet your FBAR online filing requirements. The penalties can be severe for failure to disclose. The deadline is April 15, but it will be extended to October 15 if you fail to file on time.

7w53pl,1518099812,How to receive and send Ether from an offline computer using geth without syncing (Paranoid Edition),"First of all, do not store your coins on an exchange. By storing them there you take the risk of having your coins stolen. There are plenty of instances where people have lost all or some of their coins they had on exchanges due to malicious and/or incompetent people running the exchange, to hackers or to government agents. Notable examples: Mt. Gox (February 2014), BTC-e (July 2017), Coincheck (January 2018).\n\nOne of the core ideas behind cryptocurrencies is to trust no-one and to be your own bank. So how to keep your private keys and Ether safe yourself? How to be your own bank? The instructions below tell you how to do just that. It isn't necessarily easy. However, it's not necessarily hard either. Just follow the instructions and you will manage. Maybe you learn something new along the way, too.\n\n# Brief explanation\n\nTo receive, just send Ether to the address of the offline account.\n\nTo send, broadcast a signed transaction scanned from a QR code to the Ethereum network using a separate online device.\n\n# Prerequisites\n\nYou will need these 3 things:\n\n- a smartphone with internet connection\n- a dedicated offline computer with a camera (integrated or USB)\n- a USB key dedicated to storing a backup of your wallet file/private key\n\n# Set up the offline computer\n\n**1.** Set up an offline computer with an operating system of your liking unless you already have an offline computer set up that you trust. I, myself, use Linux, but all of the necessary software are also available on Windows and Mac OS, as well.\n\n**2.** Install [latest version of geth from an official source](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads). Or better yet, build the latest stable version from [source](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum).\n\n**3.** Install an application that can generate QR codes from text and can read QR codes using the computer's camera. On Linux you can install `qrencode` for generating QR codes and `zbar-tools` for reading them. Sorry, I don't have any recommendations for Windows or Mac OS users. I'm sure there are plenty of QR code applications on those systems.\n\n**4.** You're done. Never connect that computer to internet again.\n\n# Create a new wallet on the offline computer\n\n**1.** Open a command prompt/terminal and navigate to the directory where `geth` executable is located at, if necessary. Use `cd` command to navigate from directory to directory.\n\n**2.** Run the following command to create a new wallet: `geth account new`.\n\n**3.** geth will ask for a passphrase. This passphrase is used to unlock the account later on. Pick a good passphrase. You do not want other people to guess it. [A dice password is a great idea](https://www.rempe.us/diceware) ([why?](https://www.xkcd.com/936)). Also, do not forget the passphrase. If you forget it, you cannot decrypt your private key and that means you cannot send Ether from your account anymore. Essentially, you will be locked out of your own account and nobody can help you unlock it again.\n\n**4.** Once you have successfully repeated the passphrase, geth spews this out:\n\n```\nAddress: {abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01}\n```\n\nThat alphanumeric string inside the curly braces (`abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01`) is the address of your new account. As you may know, Ethereum addresses are prefixed with `0x`. Prefix your address to make out `0xabcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01`. Copy that prefixed address to clipboard.\n\n**5.** Try unlocking and locking your account. This is to make sure you still remember your passphrase. Run `geth console` in the command prompt. This opens geth with an interactive console.\n\n**6.** In geth run this: `personal.unlockAccount('0xabcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01')`\n\n**7.** Your passphrase is prompted. Once you have entered the correct passphrase, geth outputs `true`. Your account is now unlocked and could be used to send Ether.\n\n**8.** Next, lock that account: `personal.lockAccount('0xabcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01')`\n\n**9.** Leave geth with `exit`.\n\n**10.** Next we will make a backup of your wallet file. We do this in case the hard drive of the offline computer dies. If you lose your wallet file, you will lose access to your account. Plug in your USB key. You should not use this USB key for anything else to prevent the wallet file from being leaked from the USB key. Copy the wallet file to the USB key. On Linux the wallet file is located at `~/.ethereum/keystore`. On Windows it is at `%APPDATA%\Ethereum/keystore`. On Mac OS `~/Library/Ethereum/keystore`.\n\n# Set up your smartphone\n\n**1.** Install an application on your smartphone that can both read and generate QR codes. I recommend [Barcode Generator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blogspot.aeioulabs.barcode) on Android.\n\n# Receive Ether to your offline account\n\n**1.** On the offline computer, open up the QR code application you installed earlier and generate a QR code from the account address in clipboard.\n\n**2.** Now scan that QR code with your smartphone and send a small amount of Ether to the address using whatever wallet/service you have used so far for sending Ether.\n\n**3.** Check that the transaction was received by checking your account at https://etherscan.io/address/0xabcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01. Just replace the example account address in the URL with your account address.\n\n**4.** Congratulations! Your new account now has Ether in it.\n\n# Send Ether from your offline account\n\nHere comes the interesting part. Since the offline computer does not have an internet access, we need to put and get certain information to and from the offline computer using other means. We could transfer this information in a file from the smartphone. But we don't want to do that because we're in full paranoid mode. No foreign devices nor files allowed! Instead we continue playing with QR codes as those can carry only short amount of text and integrity of the text can be easily verified.\n\n**1.** First, on your smartphone, generate a QR code of the address where you want to send Ether to.\n\n**2.** Read that QR code using the QR code application on the offline computer. Copy the address to clipboard.\n\n**3.** Open a text editor/notepad on the offline computer. We will write a `eth.signTransaction()` call in it since it is easier to work in a text editor than in geth console.\n\n**4.** Write this in the text editor:\n\n    eth.signTransaction({\n      from: '0xabcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01',\n      to: '0xdaf265f1e60924e39f6a0b0f2a743518b58902c5',\n      value: web3.toWei(0.001, 'ether'),\n      gasPrice: web3.toWei(0.1, 'gwei'),\n      gas: 21000,\n      nonce: 0\n    })\n\n`from` value should be your account address we created earlier. The value should be enclosed in quotes.\n\n`to` value should be the address where you want to send Ether to. Paste it from clipboard. Again, the value should be enclosed in quotes.\n\n`value` is the amount of Ether you wish to send. Geth wants the amount in wei ([what's wei?](http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/ether.html#denominations)). Instead of typing the amount in wei, we use `web3.toWei()` function to convert other units to wei. In the example we convert 0.001 Ether to wei.\n\n`gasPrice` is the gas price in wei. Again, we use `web3.toWei()` to convert other units to wei. This time we convert 0.1 gwei to wei. Please, be careful when using `web3.toWei()`. If you omit the second argument (unit, in this case `gwei`), `web3.toWei()` defaults the unit to `ether` which could cause your transaction to become extremely expensive: 0.1 Ether * 21000 (amount of gas basic transactions use) = total transaction cost of 2100 Ether! I explicitly define the unit every time to avoid such mistakes. You can check the current recommended gas price at https://ethgasstation.info.\n\n`gas` is the maximum amount of gas you wish the Ethereum network to use for processing the transaction. Basic transactions use 2100 gas so I defined that as the maximum. The transaction uses more gas if you include a note with your transaction, for example. You could leave this parameter out. But I chose to define it anyway to avoid any gas usage surprises.\n\n`nonce` should be a number. Nonce stands for number used once. To know which number you should use, you should now consult your account (the one we created earlier) at https://etherscan.io/address/0xabcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01 on your smartphone. If your account has no outgoing transactions in its history, which is the case if you just created the account, the nonce to use is 0. If your account has outgoing transactions, open the latest and check its nonce. Increment the nonce of the latest outgoing transaction by 1.\n\n**5.** Double and triple check that the call and the values are correct. Copy that `eth.signTransaction()` call in its entirety to clipboard.\n\n**6.** Run `geth console` in the command prompt.\n\n**7.** In geth console, unlock your account by running `personal.unlockAccount('0xabcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01')`.\n\n**8.** Paste the `eth.signTransaction()` call in clipboard to geth console. Geth should output something like this:\n\n    {\n      raw: ""0xf86c808504a817c800825208943535353535353535353535353535353535353535880de0b6b3a76400008025a04f4c17305743700648bc4f6cd3038ec6f6af0df73e31757007b7f59df7bee88da07e1941b264348e80c78c4027afc65a87b0a5e43e86742b8ca0823584c6788fd0"",\n      tx: {\n        gas: ""0x15f90"",\n        gasPrice: ""0x5f5e100"",\n        hash: ""0xda3be87732110de6c1354c83770aae630ede9ac308d9f7b399ecfba23d923384"",\n        input: ""0x"",\n        nonce: ""0x0"",\n        r: ""0x4f4c17305743700648bc4f6cd3038ec6f6af0df73e31757007b7f59df7bee88d"",\n        s: ""0x7e1941b264348e80c78c4027afc65a87b0a5e43e86742b8ca0823584c6788fd0"",\n        to: ""0xdaf265f1e60924e39f6a0b0f2a743518b58902c5"",\n        v: ""0x1b"",\n        value: ""0x38d7ea4c68000""\n      }\n    }\n\n**9.** Copy the value of `raw` (excluding enclosing quotes) to clipboard. That is the signed transaction.\n\n**10.** Lock the account by running `personal.lockAccount('0xabcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01')` in geth console.\n\n**11.** Generate a QR code from the signed transaction in clipboard.\n\n**12.** Scan that QR code with your smartphone. Verify that the code matches the signed transaction. Copy the signed transaction to clipboard.\n\n**13.** On your smartphone, navigate to https://myetherwallet.com and select `Send Offline` from the top menu. Scroll down until you reach `Step 3: Send / Publish Transaction`.\n\n**14.** Paste the signed transaction into the box titled `Signed Transaction`. Then click `Send Transaction`. MyEtherWallet will ask for a confirmation. This is your last chance to make sure that everything checks out in the transaction. Confirm the transaction.\n\n**15.** MyEtherWallet's node will broadcast the transaction to the Ethereum network. Soon enough the transaction should be visible in the recipient's account. Congratulations, you just sent some Ether from an offline account!\n\n# Questions, feedback, tips?\n\nThank you for your time and for reading! I hope with these instructions you can keep your private keys and Ether safe. If you have any questions or feedback, please leave a comment.\n\nIf you liked the instructions and you feel generous, please send a tip to `0xdaf265f1e60924e39f6a0b0f2a743518b58902c5`. And donate something for the people running https://myetherwallet.com, too. By having developed and hosting MEW they do a great service to the Ethereum community. :)\n\n# FAQ\n\n**Why is this method of receiving and sending secure?**\n\nIt's secure because your private keys or passphrases never enter online devices. They cannot be leaked via internet from the offline computer. Of course, your private keys could be leaked from the backup USB key, if you plug that USB key to other devices. You should not plug it in anywhere else other than the offline computer.\n\nThe weakest link in this method of receiving and sending is the QR codes. Still, attack surface is fairly limited. To my understanding QR codes are safe, but please let me know if there are some control codes that can be exploited or if there are other means to execute arbitrary code using QR codes.\n\nThen of course, there is the possibility that someone steals your offline computer and tortures the passphrase out of you.\n\n**What about the signed transactions? Are they safe?**\n\nYes. You could post your signed transactions to Reddit. Then people could broadcast those transactions but that's all. They cannot alter the transactions without rendering the signature invalid.\n\n**Are Ledger/Trezor/hardware wallets secure when plugged to online devices?**\n\nTo my knowledge, so far they have been secure. But you need to trust that the hardware wallet is legit and not a counterfeit and that there are no bugs or security holes in it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7w53pl/how_to_receive_and_send_ether_from_an_offline/,12,9
