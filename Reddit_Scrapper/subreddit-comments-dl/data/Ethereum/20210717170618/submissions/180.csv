It might be software bug, hardware reset, being hacked, etc. It looks to me being a validator is extremely risky since I may loss all my deposits. \n\nUnder POW consensus, the cost of a malicious miner is only the power consumed. Can we have a similar magnitude of penalty to POS validators? Maybe slashing out 5%~10% deposit? \n\nMy concern is that if all deposits might be slashed out, most people will not be willing to deposit and become validators. Or people will only deposit a small portion to be a validator. Then a malicious attacker will be more likely succeed.

But Ethereum is larger than Vitalik.

And telling people what to think or do, runs opposite to the spirit of crypto.      \n\nVitalik should grow up, and realize that Ethereum is not about Vitalik. We welcome his contribution, but if he doesn't like it anymore, he's welcome to leave. There's plenty of smart developers who'd love to take his place, and build the next revolution.    \n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mn6b1/if_vitalik_cant_handle_the_heat_he_should_leave/,0,11

7mn93e,1514475304,The Ethereum Foundation itself is responsible for creating and supporting a thriving community!,"In response to the current discussion around the shortcomings of the community in general and to the comments of Vitalik in particular I want to add the following line of thought:\n\n2 years ago the discussions within this community were centered around technical aspects. \n\nAs a curious amateur I remember when I first clicked on the ethereum.org website, how excited I was for the endless opportunities, and at the same time I was confused because it was almost impossible for me to imagine how these ideas will look in practice. But I imagined how much more time, quality of living and energy people would have in a world where this vision of using software to change the flow information, wealth and power became reality. \n\nTowards the end of last year most of the energy started being spent on developing proprietary concepts, and the number of ERC20 tokens exploded.\n\nThe Open Source idea of ethereum seemed to be neglected, and instead of thinking about how to make truly decentralized, liquid and democratic organizations a reality (be it in corporations, university or politics) or truly cut out the middle men, everyone simply copied a contract to create almost arbitrary ERC20 tokens out of thin air. \n\nI remember after the first ICO (DGX), people here were discussing how Digix aims to cut themselves out and establish a real DAO. After the first ICOs, this point was almost completely forgotten. \n\nNot only that, but to the majority even the decentralized aspect doesn't matter anymore, so you just have a pretty normal company that issues tokens to manipulate people into buying.\n\nIt takes time, integrity and energy to bring the ideals of ethereum into the real world. The most work is to be done where the technology and the real world come together.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people flocked towards ethereum with curiosity and a selfish desire to make money. Unfortunately there was not much more to do than to make money, so most people stopped there.\n\nAnyway. My whole point is: While we live in a partially toxic culture which worships shortsighted self-interest, the responsibility of establishing a thriving community is solely in the hands of the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nGive people the tools to be truly excited about the possibilities of ethereum! People have indirectly given you hundreds of millions of dollars to execute your vision. Build a culture of innovation within the organization with that money! You can't blame the lack of monetary incentives. Enhance your profile so people can spot the difference between the open source base layer and everything else! Communicate with the public in a coherent and easy-to-understand way!\n\nThe EF mission, in their own words, is to ""promote and support Ethereum platform and base layer research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols and tools to the world""\n\nWhen I go to ethereum.org/foundation, I don't see if the EF is doing any work to actually bring the mission statement into reality. Maybe they are actively doing it. But to me as a layman there's no way to interact with an Open Source movement that is not coherently communicating. From looking at the website, the EF looks almost abandoned.\n\nWho are the members? (Are there more than 3?) Who is leading the organization? What's the plan for coping with the sudden growth and popularity? Is the Foundation limited to the Core Devs? Who is running the day to day activities within the organization and marketing? What is the EF doing to promote their mission? How much funds are available? Which projects and studies are running at the moment? Which are concluded and what did they accomplish? How are the funds being used exactly? Which local structures does the EF support to grow a decentralized ecosystem? How are the local structures incentivized to work on protocols and tools? Why is the Ethereum Wallet still not usable for average people at all?\n\nAs long as the EF is not actually building and scaling a transparent, efficient and productive organizational structure that holds itself accountable towards it's mission statement, there is indeed a real possibility of ethereum being taken over by greedy people whose primary motivation is to simply extract as much money out of the technology, even if it dies in the process. \n\nIn the end it is about whether the community can attract empathetic people who see and feel the consequences of their actions beyond their personal life.\n\nWe are embedded in a society that desperately needs a structural renewal on many levels.\n\nFrom all blockchain projects ethereum enjoys one of the least pathological environments.\n\nThe goals of the EF are by definition in contrast to contemporary society, i.e. disruptive. Lots of players will be hostile or indifferent towards true change. But I'm optimistic there are enough people out there wo see the greater picture and are willing to work for a livable future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mn93e/the_ethereum_foundation_itself_is_responsible_for/,127,34
