7b77fs,1509994105,Looking For ICO Head,"Looking to get into contact with someone who has successfully built and launched an ICO that was either theirs, or that they developed for. For obvious reason, they must be individuals who are accessible, and who can reasonably be reached. The company is also looking for big time sponsors in the crypto sphere.\n\nThe ICO in question will be looking for upwards of 200 million dollars. It's an exchange with a multitude of patents, a few million USD raised (via stocks), a working product, and a coin that's almost complete. The technology was initially based in the stock industry, but it's since been expanded to ICO/crypto as a means of fundraising. The goal is to launch within the month.\n\nProper advising is the main component the company is lacking in at the moment, which is something that's desperately needed given the inventors limited background in the field. However he's found the advisors he's been in contact with thus far wanting, so something more serious is required.\n\nCompensation in the form of tokens can be negotiated.\n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations.\n\nI've provided the additional info in the offchance that ICO heads check these subs.

7b83rl,1510001878,Development: Ethereum on Embedded Devices?,"From: https://that.world/~classic/2017/10/17/sputnikvm-rux/\n\n&gt; If one wants to get cryptocurrency integrated with embeded devices and actually do something more useful than relaying transactions (like Blockstream’s satellite), at least a light client is needed. In one part, the light client uses Merkle proofs for querying to avoid storing the full “world state” locally. In another part, the light client also needs to be able to execute transactions and get the result locally. This posts talk about the later.\n\n&gt; Usually in embedded devices, resources and computations are limited. There might only be a really lightweight microkernel, or even no kernel running. That means, many features you would expect to be immediately available once a program is started will not be there. This may even include memory management. And a program that wants to run on an embedded device will need to deal with them.\n\n&gt; The above restrictions make Rux a good test ground. Rux is a microkernel that I started to develop around last year. With a lot of ideas borrowed from seL4, it features a capability-based system. One particular thing about Rux is that it only deals with the bare-minimal amount of resource management, and delegate the actual memory management to userspace. (In the mean time, Rux handles task scheduling, which is currently a Robin-round scheduler, because in the general microkernel research field, there has not been a good solution for an userspace scheduler.)\n\n&gt; SputnikVM itself can be considered a pure function – it recieves all the inputs it needs in the beginning, does some computations, and then generates all the outputs in the end. In the middle, no interaction is required. This makes it so that the VM can be ported to require only a minimal set of functionalities from the kernel:\n\n&gt; Basic task scheduling, or in the case of running bare metal, no task scheduling is needed.\n\n&gt; Memory resources management, to tell the program which physical memory areas are available for use.\nAfter that, SputnikVM can use a self allocator and do its own memory management, paging and heap allocation in userspace.\n\n&gt; Right now, given a VM context, and the block header parameters, the ported VM running on Rux is able to execute simple transactions, calculate the used gas, and get the result. Below I’ll talk about the details of how to try the program (called sputnikvm-on-rux) yourself and what actually happens under the hood.\n\nAnd: https://www.etcdevteam.com/blog/devupdate/2017-11-3.html\n\n&gt; Release SputnikVM 0.7.8, which includes support for no_std, allowing Sputnik to run on embedded devices. To learn more, check out @sorpaas’s blog post SputnikVM, the Rux Microkernel, and Embedded Devices, where he steps through the reasoning and implementing of a such a strange and beautiful beast.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7b83rl/development_ethereum_on_embedded_devices/,1,0
