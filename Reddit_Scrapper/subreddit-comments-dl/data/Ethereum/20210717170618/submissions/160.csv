Shit's dope.\n\nThe long and short of this project is that I got sick and tired of people telling me that the bullish Cryptocurrency market we're in was analogous the the 1600's Tulip Mania.\n\nSo to make fun of these people I created [cryptulips.co](https://cryptulips.co).  Which is basically CryptoKitties, **but with tulips**.  Allowing people to trade, grow, breed, and sell unique digital tulips that live forever on the blockchain.\n\nIf you signup I'll keep you in the loop on the development (when it's on ropsten, main network, etc) and give you first crack at gen0 tulips.\n\nI just [posted this the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7l4ayt/tulip_mania_in_crypto_is_bullshit_so_i_made/) on r/ethtrader and it went crazy! \n\nCryptulips is primarily a joke, but I hope it'll be a fun learning experience and that it will ruffle the feathers of some of the old economic guard.\n\nIf you think it's funny, or interesting please holler at me and sign up!\n\ntl;dr I'm making CryptoKitties for Tulips to make fun of naysayers\n\n**edit**\ncheckout r/cryptulips\nTwitter: [@cryptulips](https://twitter.com/cryptulips)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lbpo9/i_got_fed_up_with_cries_of_tulip_mania_so_im/,558,122

7lbtvd,1513885003,How do Blockchains of Tokens launched on Ethereum interact with Ethereum blockchain?,"Had a question on ETH and tokens launched on ETH platform that I've been trying to wrap my head around. So let's take OmiseGO for example.\n\nIf I were to do a transaction with OMG tokens, does that transaction get logged on a separate blockchain for OmiseGO? Will this transaction be logged in any way on the ETH blockchain?\nThere'll of course be a network fee associated with the transaction, but does this network fee entirely go to nodes operating on OMG blockchain? Is there a ""gas"" fee involved on ETH blockchain for this transaction as well?\n\nI hope my question makes sense.

The Rudar Project is an economic experiment that seeks to test not only how everyday products can be commofdified into appreciating assets via the Ethereum blockchain, but whether or not that commodification makes overall consumption more efficient.\n\nI have an Introductory Series and several supporting pieces on the Rudar Project website to explain the premise and provide the details of the Project. But I could always just explain it here on Reddit.\n\nIf you don't feel like reading, then I humbly request that you take a 2-3 minute survey that helps gain some preliminary data for the project. There is no personal data being collected in this survey.\n\nRudar Project Website: https://www.rudar.io/ \nSurvey Link: https://s.surveyplanet.com/ryk7BorzM\n\nThank You for reading.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from the Introductory article:\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lcc4q/turning_laundry_detergent_into_a_tradeable/,0,0
