7ofoow,1515198525,Is an Ethereum Mixer/Tumbler causing high gas price?,"Ethereum gas prices seem to have gone crazy recently (2018-01-05 21:00 UTC to 2018-01-06 00:30), with people having to pay over 100 GWei if they want to get transactions through in less than 5 minutes.\n\nI wonder if it is because of some sort of new Ethereum ""Mixer"" or ""Tumbler"" that is designed to obfuscated the flow of Ether?\n\nFor example, look at some of these txns in block 4860738, particularly the ones for between 20 and 90 Ether and with a gas price of 250 - 320 GWei:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/txs?block=4860738&amp;p=2\n\ne.g. here's an address one of these txns is going to:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xdd61c01409dc77822bc6984c4b78dcb0745fa6e3\n\nNotice how the two IN transactions add up to 100 ETH (7+93), as do the two main OUT transactions, plus a much smaller OUT transaction (presumably a comission fee).\n\nThere's thousands of transactions to addresses like this in the last few blocks I've looked at (4860720 - 4860738), all with pairs of IN transactions that add up to 100 ETH. Seems to be a new address each time.\n\ne.g.\n\n * https://etherscan.io/address/0xcafd548879d01c7b1830eb5322b138e904135929\n * https://etherscan.io/address/0x6ec9b21e47027e8faf31fe95622ddf13e5e6bf8d\n * https://etherscan.io/address/0xa147446e9a797dc20dc9a17abcf77361c5779286\n\nAnyone seen this before or know what it is? Because the addresses are new each time it doesn't show up as a ""gas burner"" on eth gas station but it certainly seems to be a significant fraction of all txns!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ofoow/is_an_ethereum_mixertumbler_causing_high_gas_price/,42,13
