7c7lek,1510393489,Is blockchain management and Smart contracts network a good degree to do Masters in ?,"Hello everyone, I recently came across an opportunity to apply for MS Information Systems with a specialization in blockchain management and smart contracts at Northeastern University-Silicon valley. I am an international student and would like to know more about my prospects if I do go for it. Is it a good idea for a front end engineer with 2 years of internship experience to go for it? I like the whole concept of blockchain and find it immensely interesting, but in terms of finding a job after doing my masters is what has got me thinking about it so much. What are your thoughts and opinions about the same? Any suggestions would be appreciated too.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7c7lek/is_blockchain_management_and_smart_contracts/,0,1
