7vbmn3,1517798087,Thoughts on Ethereum smart contracts - Share offerings for companies,"I own a small national company and was wondering how and if possible to use ETH smart contracts to offer shares. \n\nIt’s a thought I’m entertaining, would offerings like this gain interest and would it assist in legitimising the use of crypto currencies.\n\nPlus being the first company to offer something like this would be great publicity for all. \n\nLove to hear your thoughts.

7vbo29,1517798536,Let's talk piracy on the blockchain,"Not spreading FUD or anything but I think this is an interesting topic. With the blockchain being immutable and all what happens when piracy is thrown in the mix. Obviously it would be very very expensive to store a movie in a smart contract but a copyrighted image is more realistic. With centralized hosting sites people can generally request to have an image taken down if they have the rights to it and if that doesn't work legal action usually does. If someone were to deploy a smart contract containing some else's work it can never be taken down. It is permanent and anyone can access it. Could the people running nodes face legal consequence since they are essentially hosting the pirated content? I think that would be unlikely, but lets hear some thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7vbo29/lets_talk_piracy_on_the_blockchain/,94,132
