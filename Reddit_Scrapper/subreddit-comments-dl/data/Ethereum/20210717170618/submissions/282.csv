7succ0,1516863125,Crypto Trading in India - An important case study to watch,"In his recent [tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/955089317608685568) Ryan Serkis spoke about how governments might react to crypto, once they pass the 'I don't know what the hell this is, but I'm going to ignore it for now' phase. One of the countries at this critical phase is India.\n\nIn the subcontinent, the crypto community has been receiving mixed messages.\n\n* The government declared cryptocurrencies are 'not legal tender', that they might be a large ponzi scheme and cautioned investors against investing.\n\n* On the other hand, the income tax department collected the identities of everyone who used crypto exchanges, and sent them a [show cause notice](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DUE4W4WXkAAx8Tg.jpg). Why jump to taxation when you haven't even defined what it is?\n\n* The government also hinted at launching its own cryptocurrency called Laxmi, named after the goddess of wealth.\n\n* More recently, a puzzling and very specific instruction has gone out to traders, asking them to deposit [20% advance tax on crypto earnings](http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/bitcoins-investors-need-to-pay-20-advance-tax-on-cryptocurrency-earnings-118012400023_1.html). This is the standard taxation on long term capital gains.\n\n* Meanwhile, leading banks in the country have decided to suspend the accounts of leading crypto exchanges in India.\n\nFor some perspective, the volume of crypto trading through India-based exchanges is an estimated 1 billion Indian rupees.\n\nThe big question is what route the largest democracy in the world will take.\n\nRyan surmised that some countries might ban it outright, some countries might go the China route, try to control and manipulate supply, some smaller ones might enable crypto-based economies to thrive, and others might insist on throwing privacy out the window.\n\nIn India, the last option seems the most likely. Those who want to engage in cryptocurrency will have to give up their identity, their trading patterns, everything, to the government. This means that decentralized exchanges will never be welcome. As centralized exchanges swell (currently said to be growing at 5 to 10% week on week), vulnerabilities will be amplified. What we witnessed with Bitconnect will be nothing compared to large scale scams in India. Not because of any particular streak of malevolence, but because economic education and information dissemination is slow and often ineffective on a large scale.\n\nThis might lead to a relook at the industry again, and the government might either - \n\n* Decide to ban crypto entirely \n* Or do a China\n\nOr, India might develop a sudden interest in decentralization and decide to give power back to the people. Hey, it could happen.\n\nWhatever the case, it would do well to watch how political systems react to crypto. These will make waves that will resonate far and for a long time to come.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7succ0/crypto_trading_in_india_an_important_case_study/,0,15
