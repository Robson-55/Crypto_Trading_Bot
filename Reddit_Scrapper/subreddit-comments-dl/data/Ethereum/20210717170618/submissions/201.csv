By looking at the transaction, then the sending account's transactions, I can see that they have quite a sizeable ether balance.  Lucky them, but not my business, surely.\n\nIsn't this a problem?

If I'm right, Ether isn't that useful.\n\nExcept, I'm thinking, VB wants an ultra service-lite framework, let others fill the gap.

The game mechanics are already in place and interesting to learn. (The game is based on the card game Gwent)\n\nCurrently all 250 beta cards have been given away, but there is talk of a 'gamma' edition of cards to be given away to a next set of testers in (maybe) the next couple of days, when most of the 'game-breaking' bugs are worked out and fixed.\n\nAt the moment you can play, even without the beta cards in your possession.
