7fhrja,1511641787,Will staking pools be able to adjust how much each staker gets?,"I was thinking about incentives in PoS and it occurred to me that large staking pools would probably not give the same percentage returns to small stakers as those with thousands of ether who actually run the pool.  Those who run the pool are probably staking the most Ether and put up all the money to run the node itself, and so will feel justified in taking a bigger return.  Small stakers may also be forced to absorb the natural variation in PoS returns and will be guaranteed (by the pool operators) a return which is a few percentage points lower than the current theoretical return based on the inflation rate and total amount of ether staked.  In such a situation, the large stakers/pool operators could make more than 8% (assuming PoS return is 8%).\n\nWhile this sounds bad, it would also encourage people to start their own pool rather than join a large one, since most large pools would be doing this.  But that's a good thing, since more smaller pools is better for decentralization.  Competition among larger pools may encourage them to give more points to the small stakers, but the returns that pools get from staking more and more Eth falls off pretty quickly, limiting the power of this incentive.\n\nSo, will pool operators be able to adjust the returns that stakers get?  What do you think about the incentives here and what do you think will actually end up happening?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7fhrja/will_staking_pools_be_able_to_adjust_how_much/,11,1
