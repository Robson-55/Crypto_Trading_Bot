If I try sending ETH there are no issues however when I try sending ICX in the last step in Metamask with the ""send"" button the target address is switched to this wallet: https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5A5F22694352C15B00323844aD545ABb2B11028#code\n\nI noticed that it's actually a contract in the comments and that this has happened to other people resulting in them having lost their tokens.

7tic0n,1517116152,The blockchain: A programmers nightmare and why dApps are so hard to program.,"dApps are hard. Why? Because the blockchain is a programmers nightmare. I don't mean that in a bad way, it is simply an unfortunate natural order of things.\n\nConsider a centralized trade: A user looks up a quote, makes an order, the centralized server responds in seconds with a state of success or failure state in a certain amount of time. And all sorts of simple optimizations are possible to make a success outcome very likely.\n\nConsider a decentralized trade: A user receives a public order book, signs a transaction, and submits it to the blockchain. Now three things can happen\n\n1. The trade can succeed\n2. The trade can fail\n3. The transaction may never be processed\n\nBut what makes this problem so much worse is that due to the public nature of the ledger, and the variance in transaction times, the market state can change so much by other transactions processed before the aforementioned one. This dramatically increases the chance of a transaction failure due to app conditions changing.\n\nSo now we as developers have to keep the pending transaction in a visible ""pending"" state until it is processed. But wait theres more!\n\nSince we don't control the users account, they can resend a transaction with a higher gas price and the same nonce, changing the transaction hash in a way that may not be visible to the dapp, and effectively putting the old transaction hash into... transaction purgatory? This is quite easy to do on with MetaMask and possibly others.\n\nSo essentially what you have is this transaction queue where you have no control over the state of each item, items can be replaced by the user without the dapp's knowledge, and items can exist in ""pending"" states effectively forever.\n\nI don't know why I wrote this, but I guess what I'm saying is its hard. Every day we have people working on retooling the way we think about web development to get this system to work better for the user, and its going to happen. We just have to be patient, but this is a key to mainstream adoption. A user experience that is smooth and intuitive.\n\nIf there are any talented frontend developers reading this, I highly encourage you to dive in to smart contracts, and analyze transaction workflows and how they can be improved. Its a huge need in the dApp world right now, where a lot of the dev talent is coming from the backend developers like myself who are rather poor at UI/UX.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7tic0n/the_blockchain_a_programmers_nightmare_and_why/,168,76

That correlates to a **lower bound** for network power draw of **714 MW**. That places the Ethereum network somewhere above [Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption) in terms of power consumption.\n\nOk, saying that the network consumes as much power as a country of 100m is perhaps not *that* meaningful. What it should at least mean, though, is that we take the issue of our external costs seriously.\n\n**What security?**\n\nIssuance is the control we have over the supply of hashing power. By not managing our demand we encourage the growth in supply. This is counter-productive for security as the real danger is hashing power at a scale that can threaten the network. It's better all around if new graphics cards go back to playing Call of Duty (or whatever, i'm old) - and the gamers will like us for it too.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7tjiru/reduce_issuance_yes_again/,58,103

Is it just because they are banking on the token inflating as new functionalities evolve, making the protocol more attractive? \n\nAlso it seems they intend to make for profit projects by building dapps on top of their new protocols and that transaction fees will be taken via a different token, WIZ for Gnosis, Entry credits for Factom. \n\nWhat I don't understand is how these two levels will interact and what will stop someone from forking a free version of their planned business model?\n\nTL;DR What is the underlying business model for Gnosis and Factom?
