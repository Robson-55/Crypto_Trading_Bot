7n7ln1,1514711033,Has anyone written a paper on the social benefits of anonymous unlicensed contracts to justify ICOs?,"There are many questions I need answered. Why must public fundraisers be allowed to be anonymous? Why must they be allowed to be anonymous public contracts i.e. ICOs ? Why are they better than traceable escrowed time based decentralised public contracts i.e. hub-based payment channels? When bad contracts can no longer be reversed by the community, who should be held accountable? When good contracts turn out years later to be evil, how do you separate the culprits? Should there be any moral justification against raising money to harm people? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7n7ln1/has_anyone_written_a_paper_on_the_social_benefits/,25,38
7n7ouq,1514712604,Schnorr or BLS signatures,"I’m currently re-reading the whitepaper for OmiseGO and care across something interesting. In a section talking about fund bonding for Ethereum trading, it said “this construction presumes that Schnorr or BLS signatures will be available on Ethereum in the near future”. I read something about Schnorr for Bitcoin recently, but I haven’t seen anything in relation to Ethereum. \n\nIs it or will it be available?

Among other things, this means that:\n\n&gt;Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.\nPayments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply.  Normally, payers must issue Form 1099.\nThe character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.\nA payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property.
