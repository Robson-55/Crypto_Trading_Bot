7veqfk,1517837301,Decentralized Derivatives Beta Launch,"DDA derivative contracts are now live! Our first product on the main Ethereum network: a week-long BTC/USD contract available on our DApp:\n\n[drct.decentralizedderivatives.org](http://drct.decentralizedderivatives.org/)\n\nOur dapp utilizes Metamask and allows you to create a derivatives contract on Ethereum without any coding. Parties can now enter into a week-long contract which will pay out the change in the BTC/USD rate over the period (that’s right, you can now go short Bitcoin..news which may have come a bit late for some).\n\nThe underlying DRCT contracts enable cross-chain asset exposure (BTC, XMR, etc.) and even off-chain asset exposure (interest rates, equity rates, etc.) all while being completely decentralized.\n\nThese contracts are tokenized derivative contracts that once created, trade as an ERC20 token. We’re currently looking for exchanges who would like to partner with DDA to list contract tokens on their exchange.\n\nPlease test out the contracts and let us know what you think.  The UX is being improved daily and the code for the contracts is also open source and any feedback is much appreciated!\n\n[github.com/DecentralizedDerivatives/DRCT_standard](https://www.github.com/DecentralizedDerivatives/DRCT_standard)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7veqfk/decentralized_derivatives_beta_launch/,0,0

7vewys,1517839292,"10,000 Tons CO2 per day and climbing - EIP 858: Reduce block reward","In **8 days**, since the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7tjiru/reduce_issuance_yes_again/) on this, the hashrate has increased over 11% pushing the baseline network power consumption to roughly 790 MW with a corresponding network contribution to global CO2 of over 10,000 Tons **per day** ([refs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q2DvnsUzgy7nQXVAkbNgvxqPfU56cGx4ubx6H8Dg6pw/edit#gid=1934769196)). As a community we should [support a reduction in the block reward (EIP 858)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/861) in order to reduce the demand we are making for mining.\n\n**There is little downside and significant upside potential benefit from supporting a reduced block reward.** Given adequate security on a forked 1 ETH/block chain there is little reason for users to choose a 3 ETH/block chain. If that security does not materialise the original 3 ETH/block chain remains available for use (+ experience). From a technical standpoint, the changes required for providing users with this choice are [minimal](https://github.com/cslarson/go-ethereum/tree/reduce-block-reward) (not a distraction). It's much more a matter for the community to decide is worth it's effort. And surely it is worth the effort when the cost/benefit is so attractive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7vewys/10000_tons_co2_per_day_and_climbing_eip_858/,63,164
