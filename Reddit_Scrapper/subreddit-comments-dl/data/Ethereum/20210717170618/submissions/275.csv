7se12v,1516710232,Would it be possible to create an new opcode that removes all historic traces of a variable?,"Hello everyone,\n\nI was thinking lately about ""the right to be forgotten"". Especially in the blockchain space this is a hard problem.\n\nIn Ethereum currently the state of any made-up variable can be stored and altered. However even when the containing contract self-destructs the data can still be retrieved by walking over the blockchain.\n\nWould it be possible to create a new opcode that removes these traces? I guess this would change the hashes of the blocks, and therefore is not a possibility, but perhaps people have ideas on how this can be solved.\n\nFor most variable it does not matter to store the traces after a variable is not used in the general state of ethereum anymore. However, for identity linked variables, it does matter.\n\nI guess it might be done with ZK-proofs, but the problem with most of these techniques, is that once the proof of a variable (e.g. a ZK-range proof: the Ethereum address that I hold the keys of contains 5-10 ETH) is handed over to an institution (e.g. a bank), then the institution can forever verify that this was the case at the moment of the proof creation.\n\nSo, if the proof could be deleted in its entirety from the public blockchain after the initial verification has been completed, then this would be much more useful for other identity related use cases.\n\nThe institution would still hold the proof, but it can't be verified anymore against the assertion on the public blockchain. So, the proof can't be trusted anymore after the initial verification.\n\nI hope the point I'm trying to make comes across.\n\nTLDR; Can we update Ethereum to remove old traces of mutations of variables, perhaps with zk-proofs somehow?\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7se12v/would_it_be_possible_to_create_an_new_opcode_that/,2,9

7sefgv,1516714776,"ICOs do not incentivize progress, except in rare cases. I've created the CrowdServe contract, an alternative that prevents speculation and directly incentivizes project progress.","I've been trying to figure out how to get funding for continued [Toastycoin](http://toastycoin.com) development. ICOs seem a little sleazy to me: they raise massive amounts of money, even though 98% aren't really creating anything useful. I don't want to create another useless token! But the grassroots funding that ICOs offer is obviously attractive, especially applied to open source or other ""common good"" projects that have difficulty getting funding through other means. What to do?\n\nI think I have a solution: the [CrowdServe contract](https://github.com/potent-primitives/contracts/blob/master/CrowdServe.sol). It's has elements of ICOs and DAOs, but it's much simpler than that makes it sound. It prevents speculative buying, directly incentivizes project progress, and even offers contributors a partial (50% - 90%) refund if they aren't satisfied.\n\n**It's a lot like a kickstarter, but with better incentives and partial refunds built-in--all implemented in 200 lines of Solidity.**\n\n###A simple example\n\nAfter getting some more feedback here, I'm going to try to raise money for Toastycoin development using this contract. Here's how it will be used:\n\nI instantiate the contract and call beginProjectRound(), passing proposalString (a description of the project), and setting the *preview stage interval* to be one week and the *round interval* to be (say) two months. The contract will now be in the **Active state** for two months, the first week of which will be the preview stage. Users can begin contributing.\n\nI'll begin working, using workerStatement() and other communication platforms to publish my progress. WorkerStatement()s will appear on the same dapp interface that contributors use to contribute or recall tokens.\n\nIn the preview stage (set earlier to 1 week), contributors can recall(), burning their tokens and getting 90% of their investment back (the other 10% is burned). They are likely to do this if I'm not showing any progress.\n\nAfter the preview stage (the remaining 1 month and 3 weeks of the Active state), contributors can still recall(), but the burn fee is now 50%.\n\nOnce two months is up, I'm able to end the Active round and collect any funds that have not been recall()'d. The contract moves to the **Inactive state**.\n\nIn the Inactive state, I can begin another project round and repeat the cycle.\n\nAlso, at any time, contributors can call contributorStatement() to upload a message, as a sort of ad-hoc messaging system directly on-chain. They can optionally burn some tokens as part of this action to gain visibility.\n\n###Game Theory\n\nThe above rules give rise to some really nice incentives:\n\n- Because speculative buying is ineffective, the community of contributors will consist entirely of people who want to see the project done. They'll demand more *real* progress than the token-hodlers we're used to, strengthening the two following points.\n- Because each contributor always has the option of a partial refund, the worker has an interest in showing consistent progress. Otherwise, near the round end, every contributor will reason ""Well, I didn't get what I paid for; might as well recall and get some money back."" While the refund is partial, the *removal of financial support* is complete, because recall burns the 10% or 50% that isn't refunded to the contributor.\n- *However*, because there is indeed a burn fee on recalls, the worker can rely on most of the raised funds staying there--given that he doesn't disappoint the contributors.\n\n###Feedback!\n\nI've tested the contract as much as I can think to, so now it's time to get some feedback. Please, ask any questions you have, and criticize away!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7sefgv/icos_do_not_incentivize_progress_except_in_rare/,13,12
