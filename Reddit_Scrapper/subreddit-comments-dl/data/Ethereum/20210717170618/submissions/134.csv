I have my doubts, whether such a rigorous formal verification of code is optimal in this space, but based on their claims they do seem to have the first ""Peer reviewed"" Proof Of stake protocol. \n\nNow we all know Casper is coming to Ethereum and I have a lot of trust in Vlad. He seems like a great guy and has been working hard on his own Proof of Stake protocol. \n\nNow I have looked but not yet found, whether Vlad or Vitalik or anyone on the Ethereum team have commented on the Proof of Stake protocol of Cardano? How does it compare to Casper? \n\nHoping for some constructive debate :) Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jw3qw/cardano_vs_ethereum/,0,8
