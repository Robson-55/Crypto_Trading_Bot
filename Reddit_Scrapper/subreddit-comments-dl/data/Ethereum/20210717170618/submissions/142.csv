7kdf2o,1513511639,How fast is POS?,"Ethereum's cap currently seem to be around 1Mtx/day with a reasonable (expensive but while waiting for sharding) fee. Sharding might not happen until 2019 but POS will come before that.\nDemand will be huge for 2018, at exponential growth and dapp launches minimum operation demand (decentralized exchanges, games etc) should go to at least 10Mtx/day.\n\nSo everything else equals where will POS put us? \n\nThe foundation is long term which is good but they are also pragmatic, are there any low hanging mitigation plans for 2018 or can we expect fees to quickly rise to $10?\n\nCan more be done with block size/gas limit without sacrifice? Faster clients? Etc etc?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7kdf2o/how_fast_is_pos/,36,23

7kek5a,1513526990,Questions about a ethereum christmas present.,"Hi guys! It's almost christmas and I'm getting ready for the holiday season and I have no idea what to get for my sister and parents.  \nI started mining and earning cryptocurrencies for over 6-7 months now and my parents as been pretty curious about it, how I'm getting paid for a having a loud computer in my room doing stuff 24/7 and what the hell is ethereum, bitcoin, decred and all that jazz.  \nMy sister enjoyed playing in the stock exchange for a while but she always felt limited by transactions fees and transactions quotas so she got pretty interested about cryptocurrencies lately. I talked with her last week and she got started and she loves it!  \nMy parents has always been conservative, they never played with stock exchange or anything like that but I would like broden their scope a bit and show them how easy it can be to do a transaction with someone with such a technology.\nSo for me it feels right this year to give them a christmas gift related to cryptocurrencies. So here's my question and I would love to have some of your inputs on how I should proceed to give them the gift. I thought something like a QR code would be perfect in a card but I'm a bit worried about link expiration and stuff like that. I'm also wondering which wallet would feel best for someone like my parents. They need a easy to use UI and something mobile friendly would be also a nice feature, they still have a linux desktop at home however.  \nI hope some of you have better ideas than I do and I would love to hear your suggestions. If some of you have suggestions about how I can distribute a QR code without worriying to much about experations date and stuff like that, it would be appreaciated.  \nI hope all you will have a fantastic holiday season and thanks! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7kek5a/questions_about_a_ethereum_christmas_present/,2,6
