In the last months/weeks I have been reading up a lot, yet focused mainly on the investing topic. Now my interest in this topic is so big that I'm looking to get more into the technology itself. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not trying to become the next top developer. My coding skills are very basic but I've picked up learning java script (and later solidity) more in depth as a new hobby and quit gaming for that, to have more time. \n\nMy question is, what ways of contribution to Ethereum do you think are possible for me?

I'm fascinated by crypto and would love to do something ethereum / crypto related. I'm sure there are still many projects to be done and it might be 'easy' to build something cool instead of rebuilding facebook or snapchat what millions of people have tried in vain.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions?
