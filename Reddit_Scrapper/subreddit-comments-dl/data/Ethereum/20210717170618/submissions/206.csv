7oa63r,1515144739,"Mining pool dominance, uncles, and decentralization","Hi,\n\na frequent criticism of Ethereum is its ""centralization"" due to two/three mining pools owning more than 50% of the hash rate. \nFrom this fact, I am somewhat surprised at the high uncle rate. Can someone shed a light on why this is still happening in spite of the few pools? How many uncles have identical content because the same pool mined them vs a different pool creating uncles due to propagation delay?\n\nAlso, is there theoretical work on what reasonable limits for uncles are? Given that they are included in the blockchain and are therefore not completely wasted work, I am unsure how detrimental they are. \n\nI started thinking along this line because I was interested in how to diversify the number of mining pools, or rather, how to break the dominance of the current ones. What keeps people from going to a smaller pool? The variance in payout? In extension to the thought above, how would a diversification of the mining pools impact current uncle rates?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7oa63r/mining_pool_dominance_uncles_and_decentralization/,7,12

7oadr6,1515147855,New to Ether. Is there a way I can increase the fee after I have send a transaction?,"I have the same problem as many others right now. I've sent a transaction of 0.25 ETH to binance and 22 hours later the transaction is still not through and I found out that it's probably because I payed a fee that was too low. Kind of an unlucky timing I think because the fee price went through the roof right after. I've paid 0,0004851 ETH as a transaction fee for that. So now my question is whether I can increase the fee after it was sent already? I used bitcoin.de to send from which most of you probably don't use. Or am I just unlucky and the transaction will take weeks to process?\n\nEdit: Also I can't find any information on any of the sites like etherchain.org or etherscan.io about the transaction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7oadr6/new_to_ether_is_there_a_way_i_can_increase_the/,7,10
