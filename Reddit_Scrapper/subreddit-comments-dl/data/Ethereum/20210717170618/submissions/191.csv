7nggqw,1514829536,Omg airdrop that many probably didn’t know occurred,"So I’m wondering how many out here in the eth community that keep their coins on exchanges like coinbase or Gemini etc know they were entitled to be part of the Omisego air drop of free tokens to eth Holders. I’m guessing that some of you have A lot of eth and possibly didn’t  know they did that. \n\nAnyway , I’m curious to know because I feel like they might wind up being worth a lot of money in the near future.

Honestly it seems a little bit absurd to me that programmers have to manually check this themselves.\n\nIn my admittedly limited experience, I can't even think of a single situation where the desired result for subtracting 2 from 1 would equal 4 billion.  Especially in the context where contracts are dealing with money and a missing check in just a single place can mean that millions of dollars are lost, it seems crazy that is the accepted way things are.\n\nWhy not have the EVM automatically throw an exception if overflow/underflow occurs?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7nh8hw/why_is_integer_overflow_allowed_in_the_evm/,22,17

7nhhqs,1514839608,Microsoft Office in Web 3.0,"Hi,\nThis post is for thinking out loud and brainstorming. Microsoft Office and Google equivalents are great, but they also kind of suck. They are slow and outdated. In Microsoft's case, I would argue they still hold a monopoly, and that is bad.\n\nCould Web 3.0 bring a change? If so, how? What would the end product look like? \n\nMy thoughts:    \n- Documents, Spreadsheet and Powerpoint are the essential three.    \n- Web only focus for best use of resources. Build progressive web app functionality so experience emulates native apps.    \n- WASM is a thing now. Build it with rust for performance/safety/concurrency.    \n- Storage is IPFS/Swarm by default.    \n- Excel uses Julia as scripting language.    \n- Perhaps a token mechanism could accelerate the development of the apps or third party store (like Google's but better, larger, more complete).    \n- Will need a different design to account for VR/AR computing soon to disrupt PC/mobile.\n\nThoughts and comments?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7nhhqs/microsoft_office_in_web_30/,0,11

I created a wallet with My Ether Wallet. One thing that got me wondering is how the user can be sure that the website does not secretly keep a copy of the JSON, address, and private-key?\n\nI did a search on web and it seems like the keys are generated through Node.js so I get the impression that it's generated on the client-side but how does the user ensure the confidential information does not get passed back to the service?\n\nIn addition, what's the best practice in securely exchanging this cryptocurrency? It seems like a practice would be to trade with a wallet that trades with outside and then move the coins to another wallet immediately after trade.\n\nI am sure this is a common consideration.

I never held on to Bitcoin, but did buy Ether, as well as a couple of ERC20 tokens.\n\nSeeing as the values are increasing, I started to think about what happens if my Trezor breaks or I lose it, rather be proactive now than try to do something about it when it's too late.\n\nMy problem is, that the information I had during the Trezor setup isn't allowing me to retrieve everything in MyEtherWallet, the only way for me to access the tokens are through Trezor. Seeing as I thought I had all the information I needed to retrieve everything and it now turns out I don't, is there any easier way of being able to retrieve everything, without creating a new wallet, moving everything there, wiping the Trezor and starting again?\n\nSorry for the noob question, just thought it would be worth asking before I do end up just moving them temporarily before wiping my Trezor.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7nijwv/probably_a_stupid_question/,2,2
