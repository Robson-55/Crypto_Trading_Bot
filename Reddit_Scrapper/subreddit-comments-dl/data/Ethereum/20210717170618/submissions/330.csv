A tremendous amount of people use MEW and this has shown how fragile that link is in the chain.  Since the Ethereum devs are programmers, I don't think they understand how bewildering it is to the average user to try and use the official wallet, metamask, etc.   One of the biggest keys to adoption is making something that everyone can easily use.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wf2ix/the_mewmycrypto_issue_highlights_why_the_official/,179,80

7wf713,1518198634,Dapps collaboration question,"Hi,\n\nI recently got into smart contract development with Solidity.\nI really like the the fact that because the Ethereum blockchain is public, I potentially can very easily integrate other smart contract data into my dapp.\n\nI saw a couple of examples for that. one was in the Cryptozombies Solidity tutorial where you could feed on Crypto Kitties. Another one was a thread here about a new Ethereum game where a really upvoted comment suggested intergrating cryptokitties in some way to create an ecosystem and the OP thought his was a really good idea.\n\nMy question is, is it really a good idea? \n\nLetting your smart contract be dependent on other 3rd party contract can be very risky. If the other contract terminates your contract suffers because it is pratically immutable.\nAm I missing something? I really wish to use other contract without the risk of dependencies.\n\nThanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wf713/dapps_collaboration_question/,1,2
