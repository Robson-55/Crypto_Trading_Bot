7fuzal,1511787387,Concept: A Decentralized Stable Spendable Cryptocurrency Backed By Ether,"Hello everyone\n\nIn the past months I've been spending a lot of my time thinking how Ethereum could reach mass adoption and have products in real world interact with Ethereum and one problem came almost every time: price stability\n\nEvery one of us wants mainstream adoption, everyone of us I bet wants to  get rid of banks and to shift the transaction processing from giants like Visa or MasterCard into the hands of miners or validators, to be able to pay directly for goods or services using Ether or Ethereum-based tokens but that is far from happening without a stable and decentralized cryptocurrency.\n\n Most merchants wouldn't accept a currency that has the chance to loose 50% of its value in a week and they would want to buy new goods to sell around that time. and most holders wouldn't want to use Ether to buy goods when its price is not that good. Converting crypto into fiat is very expensive with very high fees...Crypto cards like Monaco or TenX convert crypto to fiat in order to pay merchants but while it's convenient it's not efficient and involves exchanging crypto and a second layer of validation handled by Visa or MasterCard which is not good, at their end they charge around 3% per transaction which is money lost by the customer/merchant. \n\nI strongly believe we can get rid of third parties, excessive fees and fiat by using Ethereum. We need is to create a system that will replace the old. While fiat won't be replaced anytime soon I believe this concept will speed up this process and provide a lot of advantages. \n\nLet's analyze Tether, each token is supposed to represent 1$ stored in their bank accounts. The fundamental problem is that it is highly centralized with a single point of failure. If the regulators decide to shut down their bank accounts the token would be worthless. Another problem is that apart from some numbers on their page I see no transparency, we can't be sure the numbers in their bank accounts match the ones on their website. Some say it's a ticking time bomb.\n\nA decentralized stable cryptocurrency wouldn't have this problem, All the Ether backing each token would be public and everyone could check it and no matter what the governments or regulators decide the system could still continue to work \n\nThe basic idea is to create a decentralized autonomous organization that would issue a stable token(initially pegged to USD) when Ether is sent to a smart contract, when people want to convert the stable currency into Ether they would simply send it to the contract and it will be automatically converted based on the Ether price in fiat and that will happen in a matter of seconds.\n\nTo stabilize the price we have to borrow some concepts from Delegating Proof of Stake. There will be a governance token for our DAO which allows the holders to vote for entities which will have the ability to input the price or Ether(or other tokens later on) and stabilize the price of the stable cryptocurrency and reach a consensus for the price by combining the inputs and penalizing and ignoring the ones who are not within some limits(for example the real price is 500$ on average and someone inputs 600$ or 300$).  The holders of the governance token could vote for changing the amount of Ether for backing each stable token in order to make it stable, for example having 1.5 or 2$ worth of Ether for each 1$ worth of stable currency and what's above that limit to be distributed to token holders and the ones chosen to stabilize the price. The price of Ether will naturally appreciate over time and from there the profits will come. There could be some fees when there is not enough Ether to stabilize it.\n\nFor the situation where there is not enough Ether to stabilize the token there will be around 30% of the governance tokens kept which will be distributed to the stable token holders just like Neo/Gas which will make the stable coin a much more desirable token to hold than Ether even when during the times where it is not stable(like in the beginning). \n\nThis token has much more potential than simply being a stable token to trade. I envision an entire developer ecosystem around it. Being able to pay smart contracts with this stable token, protecting merchants and the regular holders from volatility and many many more.\n\nThe whole point is to transform value from an unstable state into a stable one and the other way. Through smart contracts this could be achieved without any fraud and complete transparency\n\nI really want to make this system a reality but I want to see how the community perceives it, if it would really bring value and there will be people who will use it. I would appreciate any feedback(especially the negative one so I could improve the model).\n\n Thanks for reading all of this :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7fuzal/concept_a_decentralized_stable_spendable/,21,13
