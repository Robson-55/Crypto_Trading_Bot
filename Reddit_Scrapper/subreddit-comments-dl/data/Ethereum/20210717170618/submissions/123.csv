7jczap,1513104815,Are faster transactions really an advantage of Casper? Wouldn't decreasing the POW algorithm of a blockchain have the same advantage?,"I was watching a video of Ivan on Tech yesterday about Casper and POS. (https://youtu.be/G-ijnQubg3w?t=5m1s) He states that an advantage of Ethereum's Casper and POS in general is that it's faster for a validator to append a block to the blockchain versus a miner solving the POW algorithm to append a block.\n\nHe states that the blockchain under Casper will logically become faster because of this (5:31). However, does the nature of Casper really give the blockchain the ability to handle more transactions? How so? Wouldn't adjusting the difficulty level of the blockchain to be generally easier or to create blocks at a faster rate have the same advantage in terms of transactions per second?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jczap/are_faster_transactions_really_an_advantage_of/,7,9

7jdljd,1513109718,Questions on MEW,"Hi all\n\nI got into crypto currencies a few months ago and have been exploring places to store long term. One of the names that keeps popping up is MEW, and the more I read about this, the more questions I have and the more hesitant i get. \n\nThe security does not bother me, i trust the security and all that, what bothers me and makes me uneasy, is the fact that everything relies on 1 file being kept and maintained and make sure you dont delete it. That concept really bothers me and i just don't feel comfortable with it. I prefer to have a place I can enter an identifier and a password that i know and don't have written down (i never write down passwords, i consider it a sin). \n\nIs there any wallet solution that combines the concept of logging in with something that is also offline? Something where i dont have to worry about saving a file on my computer and keeping it backed up and also hidden from people. For example, I would love to replace the json keystore file with a long identifier passphrase string followed by my password. \n\nI liked the idea of being able to access it with the private key, but then i realized that the private key does not ask for a password, it just works, and that just makes me want to delete the private key altogether and never store it anywhere. \n\nThe best solution so far seems to just get a ledger wallet or something. \n\nMy favorite solution so far is to just store my stuff on a website somewhere, like coinbase or some other exchange, just becasue it has 2 factor authentication, your standard username and password which i can readily change and control, and i can access everything anywhere I am.

I tried posting on the Mist Github page but nobody answered me there.\n\nI'm not tech savvy at all when it comes to Ethereum and Mist, and this is an issue I've been struggling with for a while. I have Mist and the Ethereum Wallet both installed on my computer but neither appear to be synced to the node and therefore aren't displaying my actual balance. I'm trying to contribute to an ICO however I can't transfer the money if my wallet isn't syncing to the node.\n\nAll I really know is that I have Geth 1.7.2, sometimes it tried to download blocks and chain structure, other times its just stuck on trying to find peers. It also never seems to recognize the fact that I've downloaded the latest version, it still seems to think I have 0.9.0 rather than 0.9.3\n\nI know this might not be the appropriate board but I'm frankly running out of ideas and I figured someone here might know, I'm sorry I haven't added much information but if anyone has any tips of feels like they may be able to help me I'd greatly appreciate it.\n\nEDIT: Also there's an asterisk next to my Ether balance, I'm assuming that has to do with the balance being wrong",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jdpcr/mist_issue/,0,3
