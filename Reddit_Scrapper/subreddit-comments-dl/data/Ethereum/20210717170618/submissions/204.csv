7o6vhr,1515108478,Land registries on a blockchain,"Sorry if this is not ethereum specific, but after some research this seems to be the most educated community, so I may as well ask here.\n\nMy home country, Colombia, has had huge problems with land registries. There are 7 million people who have been forcibly removed from their homes, and even though things have gotten much better lately, and the government is trying to return the land to the original owners, there are huge problems with the records. A lot of times the ownership records have been lost, destroyed or tampered with, making it impossible to corroborate ownership. Even though the current government is decent in this sense, nothing stops a future government or a single actor tampering with the records and transferring possession to themselves.\n\nWould the decentralized and unalterable nature of blockchain be a good fit for this kind of registry? Would it be particularly expensive to run such a system?\n\nSorry if it is a dumb question, I am a blockchain newbie, but this seems to be a real world application of blockchain technology with huge benefits, if I am understanding this correctly.\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7o6vhr/land_registries_on_a_blockchain/,37,15

7o6vur,1515108567,Ethereum Denver - January 11th - Breakout Sessions,"RSVP here: https://www.meetup.com/Ethereum-Denver/events/246075652/\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nWe hope your 2018 is off to an excellent start.\n\nFor our first gathering of the year, we'll be approaching things a bit differently. Those of you oldschool ETHDEN members might recall how things were back in the day: smaller groups and more intimate discussions. These days it's harder to capture this looser vibe – and that's okay for large presentations. But wouldn't it be cool to strike a balance with occasional events that foster lively group discussion?\n\nWe think so. Breakout Sessions, held periodically throughout the year, will aim to do just that. We'll start the evening with the usual pizza, beer, and hanging out, then split into separate groups chatting about distinct topics. For this meetup, the topics will be:\n\n1.) Ethereum 101. Coury will talk about the platform from a beginner's perspective. What exactly makes Ethereum unique, and what does that mean for developers and entrepreneurs?\n\n2.) Hardware Wallets. Sasha will explain why these pint-sized devices are the best way to secure your digital wealth, and cover some of the most popular options.\n\n3.) Scaling. Kent will talk about the big obstacles facing Ethereum as it aims to adopt a wider audience, and outline the projects that aim to conquer these challenges.\n\nThese three talks will serve as a jumping-off point for a wider, group discussion, where everyone is encouraged to participate and provide their own insights and questions.\n\nBig props, once again, to Ideas By Nature (http://www.ideasbynature.com/) for sponsoring this event. IBN continues to aggressively hire in the blockchain and development space. They're Denver-based, filled with talented people, and are positioned for an amazing 2018! And thanks, as always, to Pivotal (https://pivotal.io/) for graciously hosting. Pivotal specializes in custom software projects, and has several offices spread around the globe.\n\nREMINDER:\n\nApplications are currently being accepted for the ETHDENVER hackathon, held February 16th-18th. Learn more and apply here! www.ethdenver.com\n\nCheers,\n\nThe Ethereum Denver Team",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7o6vur/ethereum_denver_january_11th_breakout_sessions/,2,1
