7otu6o,1515363633,Beginner questions on Ethereum,"Hi,\nSo at the beginning. I know most of the questions are answered somewhere. But most threads are pretty old and I cannot comment on them to ask further when not understanding. So please don't be too harsh :).\nI have a few beginner questions about Ethereum:\n\n1) On https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases I can find the Ethereum Wallet and Mist. As far as I understood Ethereum Wallet is Mist with disabled Browser function.\nSo. What could be the reason to not download Mist? Does it have any downsides?\n\n2) The Ethereum Blockchain is pretty huge when running the wallet on a notebook with a small SSD. I see I can use the light feature with just like 2.5GBs of Space usage.\nWhat informations are missing there? What are the downsides of it? And why do I still need like a whole day to download the blockchain (I always have 0 to max. 2 peers. With full node like 8-11).\n\n3) When I want to receive eth: \nDoes the Mist wallet automatically updates the blockchain, or do I need to restart it?\n\n4) When I want to buy ETH. Should I use the main network or the testing network? \nJust from logical thinking I would say the main network. But some beginner guides use the test network.\n\nThanks in advance",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7otu6o/beginner_questions_on_ethereum/,23,11

7ou48x,1515366175,Why did a second transaction happen when sending my ETH to GDAX?,"So I sent my Ethereum from my wallet to my GDAX account. I first tested with a small amount. That successfully went through and landed on my GDAX. I then sent over the second, real transaction that I wanted. Everything was going well, got success from etherscan, got a confirmation email from Coinbase.\n\nI started waiting for the funds to actually show up on my GDAX account and was wondering when it will show up. Then I started shitting my pants because I refreshed the Etherscan page and see that a second transaction somehow occurred successfully sending my Eth to some unknown address. Weird thing was, it only sent the second amount I sent to my GDAX in my second transaction, and not the total amount i sent over two transactions. I checked the address it was sent to and it seems other funds were being deposited in there and moved out as well (10-15 transactions, mostly deposits). At this point I thought I'd been phished. But a couple minutes later, the funds show up on GDAX and I confirm that there was no email from Coinbase sending my Eth anywhere outside my account.\n\nWhy does GDAX initiate another transaction? And what exactly is this address they use?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ou48x/why_did_a_second_transaction_happen_when_sending/,2,2
