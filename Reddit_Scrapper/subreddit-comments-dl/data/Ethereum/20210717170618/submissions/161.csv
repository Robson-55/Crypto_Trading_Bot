7le6mv,1513907135,How can we put a relief on this transaction fee pressure on the biggest cryptos Right Now?,"It seems like transaction fees are exploding, especially tonight in the bigger crypto currencies at least.\n\nhttps://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-eth-bch-ltc.html#3m\n\nfor comparison. Transaction fees for the biggest 4 Cryptocurrencies seem to grow exponential.\n\n---\n\nAverage transaction cost in the past 3 weeks. From early December to today --&gt; \n\nETH : 0.20$ to 1.40$ (increase of 7x).\n\nSegWit Coin : 6$ to 55$ (almost 10x)\n\nLitecoin : 0.16$ to 1.50$ (10x)\n\nBCH : stayed in the low 0.20$-0.30$ \n(blocks are not full yet, but the usability is also limited still) \n\n---\n\nThis is a MAJOR problem right now. If this spreads to the general public that all big crypto coins ar going to be marked/connected with:\n\na) HIGH fees (higher the all traditional paymentsystems and sometimes slower then wire transfers)\n\nb) Super wasteful from a environment point of view. The Bitcoin Prove of Work system alone is consuming more electricity then all the people in Denmark (over 5 Million).\n\nI am worried that this could throw back the progress and also the general interest in crypto by quiet a lot...\n\nSo how are we going to approach this issue? Are there any solutions we could implement in the near future to give the crypto world a relief and space to grow?\n\nSome might say, just use altcoins but the places and therefor ways you can use them is very limited...\n\n1.50$ per transaction on ETH doesn't seem crazy yet. But these fees are exponentially growing and could reach +20$ much sooner then most people expect.\n\nTherefor I think we need solutions right now or the momentum cryptos in general have build will stall rapidly. It's a natural wall we are standing in front.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7le6mv/how_can_we_put_a_relief_on_this_transaction_fee/,86,56

7lfmv5,1513923450,How will AVG gas price change over time?,"[TLDR] How will average gas price change with rising ETH price, with full raiden on mainnet, and with sharding.  Each separately, but also how they would interact would be interesting as well.\n\nWith the price of Ethereum having risen over these last two weeks the average transaction costs 40 cents and takes 1 minute to process.  In terms of time we're doing really well but 40 cent transaction fees seem a bit high.  This is especially so, if we want dApps like cryptokitties or messengers to work as we can't have a single action costing so much (or do these represent the use case of raiden).\n\nAs the price of ethereum continues to rise, will miners be accepting lower and lower gas prices to keep the price around 50 cents (or ideally closer to 1 cent or lower) per transaction?  Also, will POS have any effect on the gas price?  I would think the price would go down as we no longer need powerhouse mining machines and mining will be almost free for those mining legitimate blocks (and extremely expensive for those not).\n\nIf there are any articles I could read or any other information regarding these topics that you could give me besides the answer to my questions, that would be amazing!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lfmv5/how_will_avg_gas_price_change_over_time/,2,7
