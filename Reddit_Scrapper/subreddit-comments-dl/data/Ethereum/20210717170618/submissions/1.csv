79zdpn,1509488637,Seeking Blockchain / Ethereum / Solidity Work,"Hey folks. I'm currently looking for remote work in blockchain / ethereum / solidity technologies. If you have any connections to companies in that space, I'd love to hear from you.  I'm a developer with 15+ years experience in Fintech, and fully believe cryptocurrency / blockchain development is future.\n\nI prepared for, took, and passed the Certified Blockchain Professional (CPB) Exam. I also just earned a Certificate of Completion for Ethereum Blockchain Developer: Build Projects Using Solidity Online. Each day I continue to grow my understanding of blockchain, ethereum and solidity. \n\nI'll be attending the Milwaukee #Blockchain Conference at Marquette University during #StartupMKE week. I hope to network with other people interested in blockchain, ethereum and solidity technologies. Hope to see you there! I think Will Pangman is coming in for a special visit to be a Panelist there as well.\n\nhttps://ude.my/UC-9DIFJJVU\nhttps://ude.my/UC-BQX6W6LA\n\n- Dan Emmons\ndan.ryan.emmons@gmail.com\nhttps://linkedin.com/in/dan-emmons\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/79zdpn/seeking_blockchain_ethereum_solidity_work/,7,6

7a28l2,1509523681,Cannot send tokens from Mist 0.9.2,"I just can't figure out how to send ERC20 tokens from one ETH address from Mist to another ETH address. These are the steps I take:\n\n1. Open up Mist wallet, go to ETH account with ERC20 tokens.\n2. In the list of tokens beneath the ETH account info, I hover over the token I want to send and click the ""Send"" button with the tiny uparrow.\n3. I copy the new ETH address I want to send the ERC20 token to and input this address into the ""TO"" field. My main ETH account (I have more than enough ether on it to cover fees) is in the ""FROM"" field.\n4. I set the amount of the ERC20 token to send and pick a fee. \n5. I click send and sign the transaction\n\nWhat happens next is that the transaction shows up on the list of ""LATEST TRANSACTIONS"" but never confirms. If I click the transaction ID link Etherscan just tells me that it is unable to locate the Transaction entry. After about 5 minutes, I get a msg box in Mist telling me that ""the transaction from [...] to [...] couldn't be successfully executed"".\n\nI have also tried to go to the ""CONTRACTS"" tab and select the transfer function, but I am not sure what to put into the value -\n 256 bits field. \n\nAny help is appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7a28l2/cannot_send_tokens_from_mist_092/,6,3
