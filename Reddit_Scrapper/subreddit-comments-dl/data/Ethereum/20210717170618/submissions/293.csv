On the MEW site it says:\n\n""Sending ETH = 21000 Gas Limit""\n""Sending Tokens = 200000 Gas Limit""\n\nDoes this mean that Gas Limit for ETH is 21000 and other ERC20 based tokens is 200000.\n\nJust been watching an ICO sale and they were recommending to send ETH with 200000Gas @ 60GWEI\n\nAny advice highly appreciated, thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ts6x7/help_with_understanding_eth_transactions_gas_etc/,1,6
