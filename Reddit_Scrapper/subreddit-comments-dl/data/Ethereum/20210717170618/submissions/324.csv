7vzn9q,1518039368,How would a smart contract zero profit online casino work?,"Have heard about gambling on blockchain before but I just though about how this could be a revolution if you casino can run by it selves and no one is making any profit from it.\n\nTraditional casinos take profit from their customers. For every $1 someone puts in they only pay out $0.8 for example. This means that ALL long term gamblers will loose their money. \n\nMy idea is that what will happen if the casino pays out $1 for every 1$ people puts in? That would mean that everyone should go +- 0 if they play enough. This would not disturb the system and the money would just cycle without doing anything. So that means that the casino will still work like a casino. You can win big sums of money if you are lucky but we would not get people who lose their life by bad gambling habits. They would simply not loose any money in the long term, but also wont win anything so they cant really cheat the system. Would this work or is it simply too good to be true. Would big whales just play to see if they win, otherwise play enough to make their money back? would that like kill the system. \n\nI think if this isn't too good to be true, someone could develop the first transparent casino that people doesn't get burned on. A casino that is actually fair for the consumer. If it is possible, I think this could be huge even if it require small transaction fees. I would definitely choose that casino instead of some fishy one that just want to steal your money.\n\nI'm surly not the first one on this subject, would just be interested in if it would work?\n\n\n\nOr even if we have a profit one, wouldn't the transparency make it much more trustworthy. Then you can see the probabilities and know someone isn't manipulation it. Here in Sweden, one company has monopoly on slot machines just to make sure it is not ran by companies that manipulate the odds just to make more profit. Its a trustworthy company own or at least a big part of it is owned by the state btw. If we had something transparent, we would not need that.

A website will display your message for all the world to see, if only you pay more than the guy before you**\n\n\nhttps://putyourfuckingtextonthefuckingblockchain.com/\n\n\nHi guys, so for the last couple of ~~months~~ days I've been working on an Ethereum smart contract thingy. It's a small little project and I'd like to hear your opinion.\n\nThe idea is roughly as follows.\n\nI like money. So I created a smart contract which stores your message forever on the blockchain (in the form of a string) if you make a transaction which has a higher value than the previous one. \n\nI also made a website which displays the latest string in a super large font and bolded letters for all the world to see. There is a javascript script running on it which enables you to instantly pay and submit your message (using metamask). There is another script running which displays the message on the actual blockchain.\n\nI'm a super noob at solidity and I welcome all feedback! It's all open source and available for you to scrutiny.\n\nI crossposted this to r/ethdev as well! I hope more and more small cool projects will be built on ethereum and I'd like to hear your opinion!\n\nEDIT: so I created a twitter acc which will contain all the previous messages!
