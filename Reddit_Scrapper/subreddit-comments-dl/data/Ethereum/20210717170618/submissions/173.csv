7m5id5,1514259983,Help: Ethereum won't send from my wallet!,"Edit: If you can help me figure out this situation I will pay you $10 USD worth of Ethereum.\n\n I find Ethereum confusing. I am not computer literate but I know how to use the CLI in bash on OSX and Linux.\n\n\nBackground: I bought Ξ4.31 back in 2016 and installed the OSX software wallet. Back then the blockchain was small enough to fit on my laptop. Eventually it took up too much space so I deleted the Ethereum wallet.\nNow I have re-installed the wallet. To my delight the Ξ4.31 is still there. I want to move my Ξ4.31 to a lighter wallet (JAXX) but the blockchain needs to update. Transactions I send get rejected.  I installed a Jaxx wallet anyway and sent some probing Ξ1.1 and to my surprise they arrived. But it is strange because my wallet still keeps my Balance at  Ξ4.31 despite moving over  Ξ1.1 to Jaxx. I have decided to send the remaining  Ξ3.21 over but it is not arriving at all. I am connected to peers and everything. \n\nI am so confused. Why won’t it send the remaining  Ξ3.21 and why does it still show  Ξ4.31 in my balance when clearly I have removed  Ξ1.1? \n\nI have updated my wallet to the latest model. My OSX system is also the most recent.\n\nEssentially, these are the two things I wish to do:\n\n\n1:Update the Mist wallet so I can send my Ξ4.31 to a lighter wallet\n\n\n\n2:Delete the chaindata folder.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7m5id5/help_ethereum_wont_send_from_my_wallet/,5,3
