This led to my transactions not showing up, or being stuck as pending. I tried to correct this by doing an offline transaction using myetherwallet for $0. I don't think it worked as now I have like 3 failed transactions from my wallet. Could you please help me fix my wallet so that I can use it again? I have wasted a lot of money on failed transactions!

7p16sc,1515441429,Blockchain smart contracts that rely on external data,"If smart contracts rely on data external to the blockchain to execute code, that data becomes the weak link in the contract.\n\nFor example: A smart contract is set up to take bets and make payouts for the result of the Superbowl. While it may seem trivial to determine who actually won the Superbowl, since millions of people are watching, it seems like it could be difficult for a smart contract to determine. Ultimately it will have to pull the results of the game from some data source that doesn't live in the blockchain opening up ways for the contract to be attacked.\n\nTo me it seems that this would be a problem for any smart contract that has to use data external to the blockchain. Is there a solution to this problem? If not, what type of use cases are there for smart contracts that do not rely on exogenous data? Two that I've been able to think of are time escrow, as presumably time is one thing that could live within the blockchain, and voting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7p16sc/blockchain_smart_contracts_that_rely_on_external/,14,16
