7gdq3l,1511966562,A question from a noob,"Hi, i'm looking for a IOS wallet for ETH, And after a quick search here everybody seems to like JAXX. (small amounts, no need for a physical wallet yet) \n\nI have my BC stored in bread which has PIN+ fingerprint+ those 12 words. \n\nJAxx has just a PIN, which is not even set up by default. \n\nI am not a crypto currency pro but, isn't it a bit light concerning security?

7gdq4c,1511966567,AMA w/ Gabriele Rigo (RigoBlock Founder) - Ask Me Anything,"Hello Ethereum community! My name is Gabriele Rigo. I've been in crypto since 2014, switching from traditional trading to cryptocurrencies trading with Rigo Investment. I moved towards blockchain as a technology progressively and in February 2016 started active solidity development of the ""decentralized hedge fund"", initially branded Drago, then re-branded RigoBlock as it is a blockchain project comprising a protocol for decentralized asset management and many reusable components.\n\nRigoBlock aims at allowing anyone to create their own decentralized pool of tokens and manage investors in an orderly manner, with the lowest barriers to entry for emerging traders. External devs will also be able to create their own platform on top of our protocol. A special case of our pools will allow for proof-of-stake mining with Casper.\n\nToday RigoBlock has a team of 3, plus two external contributors, has been accepted into H-Farm's blockchain business accelerator and is in the process of finalizing its first external investment (so far the project has been self-funded). We are still a small project and, notwithstanding market pressures, are looking to stay a small team and be totally focused on product.\n\nWe envision tokens as a new asset class and are looking to organize decentralized pools of tokens.\n\nWe took a big risk in building on top of Ethereum, as at the beginning most bitcoiners were critical about it. Luckily for us, the decision is paying off now, as we no longer have to defend our choice of building on top of Ethereum as a base layer.\n\nAsk me anything!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7gdq4c/ama_w_gabriele_rigo_rigoblock_founder_ask_me/,1,2

7ggc0c,1511986819,Getting Started with MyEtherWallet.com,"*   Please take some time to understand this for your own safety. 🙏\n*   Your funds will be stolen if you do not heed these warnings.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zPRVwQH.png\n\n---\n\n### What is MEW?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rrkqpOw.png\n\n*   MyEtherWallet is a free, open-source, client-side interface.\n*   We allow you to interact directly with the blockchain while remaining in full control of your keys &amp; your funds.\n*   You and only you are responsible for your security.\n*   We cannot recover your funds or freeze your account if you visit a phishing site or lose your private key.\n\n---\n\n### MyEtherWallet is not a Bank\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zYsKqTe\n\n*   When you open an account with a bank or exchange, they create an account for you in their system.\n*   The bank keeps track of your personal information, account passwords, balances, transactions and ultimately your money.\n*   The bank charge fees to manage your account and provide services, like refunding transactions when your card gets stolen.\n*   The bank allows you to write a check or charge your debit card to send money, go online to check your balance, reset your password, and get a new debit card if you lose it.\n*   You have an account with the bank or exchange and they decide how much money you can send, where you can send it, and how long to hold on a suspicious deposit. All for a fee.\n\n---\n\n### MyEtherWallet is an Interface\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/7QNSG0B.png\n\n*   When you create an account on MyEtherWallet you are generating a cryptographic set of numbers: your private key and your public key (address).\n*   The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser.\n*   We never transmit, receive or store your private key, password, or other account information.\n*   We do not charge a transaction fee.\n*   You are simply using our interface to interact directly with the blockchain.\n*   If you send your public key (address) to someone, they can send you ETH or tokens. 👍\n*   If you send your private key to someone, they now have full control of your account. 👎\n\n---\n\n### Wait, WTF is a Blockchain?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Wjs2hv3.png\n\n*   The blockchain is like a huge, global, decentralized spreadsheet.\n*   It keeps track of who sent how many coins to whom, and what the balance of every account is.\n*   It is stored and maintained by thousands of people (miners) across the globe who have special computers.\n*   The blocks in the blockchain are made up of all the individual transactions sent from MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Exodus, Mist, Geth, Parity, and everywhere else.\n*   When you see your balance on MyEtherWallet.com or view your transactions on etherscan.io, you are seeing data on the blockchain, not in our personal systems.\n*   Again: we are not a bank\n\n---\n\n### We need you to understand that we **cannot**...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/mY8gqoF.png\n\n*   Access your account or send your funds for you X.\n*   Recover or change your private key.\n*   Recover or reset your password.\n*   Reverse, cancel, or refund transactions.\n*   Freeze accounts.\n\n### **You** and **only you** are responsible for your security.\n\n*   Be diligent to keep your private key and password safe. Your private key is sometimes called your mnemonic phrase, keystore file, UTC file, JSON file, wallet file.\n*   If lose your private key or password, no one can recover it.\n*   If you enter your private key on a phishing website, you will have all your funds taken.\n\n---\n\n### If MyEtherWallet can't do those things, what's the point?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/FG9cYhd.png\n\n*   Because that is the point of decentralization and the blockchain.\n*   You don't have to rely on your bank, government, or anyone else when you want to move your funds.\n*   You don't have to rely on the security of an exchange or bank to keep your funds safe.\n*   If you don't find these things valuable, ask yourself why you think the blockchain and cryptocurrencies are valuable. 😉\n*   If you don't like the sound of this, consider using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/signup). They have more familiar accounts with usernames &amp; passwords.\n*   If you are scared but want to use MEW, [get a hardware wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html)! These keep your keys secure.\n\n---\n\n### How To Protect Yourself from Phishers\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zhEtRp7.png\n\nPhishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyEtherWallet, EtherDelta, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.\n\n*   Use the [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn) or [MetaMask](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/migration/moving-from-private-key-to-metamask.html) Chrome Extension to block malicious websites.\n*   Always check the URL: `https://www.myetherwallet.com`.\n*   Always make sure the URL bar has `MYETHERWALLET LLC [US]` in green.\n*   Do not trust messages or links sent to you randomly via email, Slack, Reddit, Twitter, etc.\n*   Always navigate directly to a site before you enter information. Do not enter information after clicking a link from a message or email.\n*   [Install an AdBlocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and do not click ads on your search engine (e.g. Google).\n\n---\n\n### How To Protect Yourself from Scams\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/7L7wGTp.png\n\nPeople will try to get you to give them money in return for nothing.\n\n*   If it is too good to be true, it probably is.\n*   Research before sending money to someone or some project. Look for information on a variety of websites and forums. Be wary.\n*   Ask questions when you don't understand something or it doesn't seem right.\n*   Don't let fear, FUD, or FOMO win over common sense. If something is very urgent, ask yourself ""why?"". It may be to create FOMO or prevent you from doing research.\n\n---\n\n### How To Protect Yourself from Loss\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/E2F0Dvx.png\n\n\nIf you lose your private key or password, it is gone forever. Don't lose it.\n\n*   Make a backup of your private key and password. Do NOT just store it on your computer. Print it out on a piece of paper or save it to a USB drive.\n*   Store this paper or USB drive in a different physical location. A backup is not useful if it is destroyed by a fire or flood along with your laptop.\n*   Do not store your private key in Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud storage. If that account is compromised, your funds will be stolen.\n*   If you have more than 1-week's worth of pay worth of cryptocurrency, get a hardware wallet. No excuses. It's worth it. I promise.\n\n**[More Security Tips!](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/protecting-yourself-and-your-funds.html)**\n\n---\n\n### Onwards!\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/H9koomb.png\n\n*   [Get a hardware wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html).\n*   [How to set up MEW + MetaMask](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/migration/moving-from-private-key-to-metamask.html).\n*   [How to run MEW Offline / Locally](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/offline/running-myetherwallet-locally.html).\n*   [How to send via Ledger hardware wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/migration/moving-from-private-key-to-ledger-hardware-wallet.html).\n*   [How to send via TREZOR hardware wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/hardware-wallets/trezor-sending-to-trezor-device.html).\n*   [How to send via MetaMask](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/migration/moving-from-private-key-to-metamask.html).\n*   [How to create a new wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/creating-a-new-wallet-on-myetherwallet.html).\n*   [How to back up your wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/backing-up-your-new-wallet.html).\n*   [How to verify you have access to the wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/accessing-your-new-eth-wallet.html).\n*   [How to send funds to your wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/faq/buying-selling-exchanging-eth-tokens-fiat.html).\n*   [How to check your balance](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/checking-balance-of-my-account.html).\n*   [Prefer a video walkthrough?
