7kwqfq,1513721699,How can I use latest snapshot with Parity?,"The laptop I use for the wallet broke and it took me a long time to replace it, and the sync is just over 10 days out of sync. It is taking a very long time to sync and I have a few thousand dollars I want to use before friday.\n\nI believe snapshots are taken every 30 thousand blocks. Currently my parity wallet is on block 4.699074 million. Current eth block is 4762195.\n\nSo, I tried starting a new sync folder hoping it would take snapshots until the last 30 thousand blocks, or probably better, but it stopped snapshot sync up to 4.475 million or something like that.\n\nIs there a way to improve the synchronization time? I wouldn't mind just having the data from a snapshot, I don't really need all the past transactions. Or is there a better option? a wallet that allows for faster synchronization? Just anything that takes less time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7kwqfq/how_can_i_use_latest_snapshot_with_parity/,0,2

7kwxrl,1513723585,Copyright Detection on the Blockchain Using Bayesian Algorithms,"YawLife employs a unique content originality engine which rewards a crowd of curators for correctly reporting on content, and creators/publishers for making/distributing content. We use Bayesian probability in the reputation mechanism to give greater weight to honest/correct reporters and prevent false reporting by bad actors. This way there is a fair, evidence-based approach to achieving consensus on whether or not a post is infringing or contextually-accurate.\n\nWe are providing the fuel to fight the rise of misinformation. The end goal is to create a platform that is full of entertaining, intelligent and truthful content. We watermark relevant metadata/data on Ethereum for the purpose of tracing original authenticity – giving creators the credit they deserve. Our focus is on using the blockchain where it’s already efficient to do so, and developing compelling utilities for it (the latter of which, as Vitalik’s already inferred, is much needed for the current value of cryptocurrency to be reflective of reality and not speculation).\n\nWe expand on our use of Bayesian algorithms on YawLife and LifeCoin [in our whitepaper, which we have available to read and give feedback on in a Google Doc here](https://docs.google.com/a/yaw.life/document/d/1PdmG_dSQKt5sg2g72Zf_Nqz55_2jR_U4tniSP5n6pFk/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nWe look forward to gauging the community’s insights on our efforts!

7kxi4c,1513728864,Parity is Bogging My System Down,"I’ve been an advocate of bigger blocks and chains since you can get a 4TB hard drive right now for around ~0.13 ETH. Ethereum processing many more transactions and having fewer pending ones than Bitcoin is enough reason why for me. But it seems like when I’m out of date, Parity slows down my system a lot. So much so I killed it to write this post, so I'll assume it may be just something with me. \n\nHere’s some example: \n\n- [High CPU usage]( https://i.imgur.com/ZVugEe0.png) on a [decent overclocked CPU]( https://i.imgur.com/ozUjh8b.png)\n- [HI Disk I/O]( https://i.imgur.com/vh4Q0yK.png)\n \nIs this normal? If so are there plans on addressing it? \n \nAn idea I had is why not have a full archive node have a “x interval” MD5 checksum of the blockchain and let users have the option of hosting that snap shot of the chain in a torrent. And then add some logic like\n\n&gt;If client has archive chain hash file of “79ac8d043dc8739f661c45cc33fc07ac” for Block 0 to 4,700,000 then continue until up to date\n\nI’m sure there is a lot wrong with that idea, just not sure why.  \n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7kxi4c/parity_is_bogging_my_system_down/,1,1

7kytuw,1513742020,Ethereum full node?,"I have an old craptop that I don't use often and am looking to repurpose as a crypto full node (just for relay and helping the network, no profit intention). The specific specs are an Atom N450 (1.6GHz, single core hyperthreaded), 2 GB DDR2-667, Lubuntu 17 OS, and a 1 TB external HDD that will be used for storing the blockchain of whatever crypto I end up running a node for. \n\nI have two questions for this community. 1, is a non-mining full node beneficial to the Ethereum network (like Bitcoin-Qt open to 8333 is to the Bitcoin network), and if yes, then what are the approximate hardware requirements for such a node and could I conceivably run one? I would just run a Bitcoin node, but I disagree with the politics of BTC Bitcoin and the effect that those politics have on the mempool and UTXO sizes (which would price me out of running a node anyway). \n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7kytuw/ethereum_full_node/,1,1
