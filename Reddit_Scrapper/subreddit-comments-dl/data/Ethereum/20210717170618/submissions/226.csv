I have already fully developed and constructed a proposal just requiring funding and a team of programmers venture capitalist and entrepreneurial businessmen to begin its inception.\n\nI need people like vitalik, Elon musk, jack ma, Jeff bezos, Jed McCaleb and of course Satoshi nakamoto’s expertise and together build this new mega corporation.\n\nBut more importantly, I need anyone like YOU to give me some advice or a path to seek out the necessary resources to get this proposal out in the world.\n\nPlease give me anything you can offer and I will ensure that I involve you as the business gets up and running and you will be rewarded in the near future.\n\nHave faith in me now and soon all will be unveiled and you will not regret it.

Whats my next step?,"Back when the refund option was available on Poloniex I cashed out almost all of it except for a small amount which I kept in as a joke (because it spelled 50.1337. Yes, I wish I was kidding). This was hardly worth anything back then but now .5 ETH is quite a pretty penny and I want it back! \n\nFor the longest time the balance was shown in poloniex but greyed out and I couldn't refund it or withdraw. Finally, after support tickets and aproximately an eternity they have unlocked it so that I can withdraw the funds to a different wallet. \n\nI've never done any DAO recovery on my own before though- is it just like another token that I can throw into my metamask wallet?

Player 1 wants to stake having met the minimum TBD requirement.\n\nA. Staker responsibility-- What are likely requirements for up time in FFG-- Cosmos' is extremely high and really only suitable for corporations with a hundred parties competing to host validators located in data centers with near 100% uptime need, attack protection and more...?\n\nIn short, will the process be any less complicated in Capser, or require less (DDOS protection, VPN and privacy protection, 100% uptime) from the individual with the means\n\nI.e. Simply send ETH to a contract, and keep the node online for the vast majority of the time?\n\nIs there a ballpark for the number of validators needed for the initial implantation of FFG, and what might the queue look like to become complete for that spot?\n\nII. Now Player 2-- This user wants join a pool.\n\nWhat's the added risk look like for the staker if the pool has uptime issues or is attacked and appears to be a bad actor?\n\nIII.
