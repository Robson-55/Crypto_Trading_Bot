7xgfcd,1518593808,How Ethereum is dependent of well synced computer time,"Hi,\nI was wondering how important is a fine synced time on an ethereum node. Are we talking about a maximum of a second delay to be able to interact with other nodes or is it more about micro or miliseconds or even nanoseconds?\nWe mostly rely on NTP servers to have this time. NTP servers rely on atomic clocks. Atomic clocks are centralised. I see a spof here. If the maximum time shift is not so low, couldn't we find a more decentralised way to have the right time?\nThanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7xgfcd/how_ethereum_is_dependent_of_well_synced_computer/,7,7

7xgvat,1518600459,Welcome to r/ethereum - the Reddit frontpage of the Web 3.0; seriously: Read this to get started! :),"---\n\n## Welcome!\n\n---\n\nWith the magical influx of new readers, I would like to welcome everyone to r/ethereum warmly. Please protect this community's philosophy by respecting our rules (see sidebar or scroll down). Let me quote the most important ones here for reference:\n\n- Keep price discussion and market talk to subreddits such as /r/ethtrader.\n- Keep mining discussion to subreddits such as /r/ethermining.\n- Keep ordinary ICO advertisements to subreddits such as r/ethinvestor.\n\nFeel free to use this thread to say 'Hi, I'm new!' or 'Hi, I'm _not_!'. If you have a question, feel free to comment and ask it below. But first **make sure you are fully synchronized** and **have a look at FAQ** on [Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/q/431). Do you have any question that feels dumb? Try r/ethereumnoobies :D\n\nDon't forget to check out /r/ethdev for the Ethereum developer community and post your diamond-shaped cat findings on r/ethsightings (don't forget to subscribe!). Thanks for flying with r/ethereum! :-)\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n---\n\n### What is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a cutting-edge blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a crypto-fuel called _Ether_.\n\n- General [White Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper), Technical [Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) (pdf)\n- [Ethereum the world computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXvs) (video)\n- [Gavin Wood's Ethereum vision at Devcon 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BvvUlKDqp0) (video)\n- [Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum introduction at Devcon 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjwr-7PgpN8) (video)\n- [Joseph Lubin's interview on building decentralized applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgLmY9oedTM) (video)\n- [BBC explains Ethereum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X33lgMbvdI) (video)\n- [Techcrunch on Ethereum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfULutvxvzY) (video)\n- [ELI5 attempts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/60hhjm/eli5_what_is_ethereum/), [this one is pretty good](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6gkd6v/welcome_to_rethtrader_new_people_let_me_save_you/dir6ah6/) :-)\n- Ethereum: [A Visual Explanation](http://veenspace.com/ethereum).\n\n### Where do I start?\n\nYou want to start by getting yourself set up with a wallet.

I don't have a tech-background but recently I have read more and more about cryptography, blockchains, but also the origins of the computer, the architecture of the internet, and modern practices of censorship and security.\n\nI was wondering how resilient Bitcoin, Ethereum or the likes are towards the increasing threat of a far reaching censorship of the internet (for example the increasing efforts in China, but also attacks in the US and Europe). Can government efficiently censor the internet now to a degree that could effectively end public blockchain use for all but the most tech-savvy users?\n\nCould ISPs for example block Bitcoin or Ethereum for good through practices like Deep Packet Inspections? Is there always a viable alternative or is a perfect censorship of the internet nowadays conceivable?\n\nI'm also generally interested in articles that explain how the internet can now be censored and if there is a point at which users will just be out of options to circumvent censorship (for example VPNs).\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7xi96p/can_the_blockchain_be_censored_away/,0,10
