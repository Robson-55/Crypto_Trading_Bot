7xgfcd,1518593808,How Ethereum is dependent of well synced computer time,"Hi,\nI was wondering how important is a fine synced time on an ethereum node. Are we talking about a maximum of a second delay to be able to interact with other nodes or is it more about micro or miliseconds or even nanoseconds?\nWe mostly rely on NTP servers to have this time. NTP servers rely on atomic clocks. Atomic clocks are centralised. I see a spof here. If the maximum time shift is not so low, couldn't we find a more decentralised way to have the right time?\nThanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7xgfcd/how_ethereum_is_dependent_of_well_synced_computer/,7,7

7xgvat,1518600459,Welcome to r/ethereum - the Reddit frontpage of the Web 3.0; seriously: Read this to get started! :),"---\n\n## Welcome!\n\n---\n\nWith the magical influx of new readers, I would like to welcome everyone to r/ethereum warmly. Please protect this community's philosophy by respecting our rules (see sidebar or scroll down). Let me quote the most important ones here for reference:\n\n- Keep price discussion and market talk to subreddits such as /r/ethtrader.\n- Keep mining discussion to subreddits such as /r/ethermining.\n- Keep ordinary ICO advertisements to subreddits such as r/ethinvestor.\n\nFeel free to use this thread to say 'Hi, I'm new!' or 'Hi, I'm _not_!'. If you have a question, feel free to comment and ask it below. But first **make sure you are fully synchronized** and **have a look at FAQ** on [Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/q/431). Do you have any question that feels dumb? Try r/ethereumnoobies :D\n\nDon't forget to check out /r/ethdev for the Ethereum developer community and post your diamond-shaped cat findings on r/ethsightings (don't forget to subscribe!). Thanks for flying with r/ethereum! :-)\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n---\n\n### What is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a cutting-edge blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a crypto-fuel called _Ether_.\n\n- General [White Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper), Technical [Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) (pdf)\n- [Ethereum the world computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXvs) (video)\n- [Gavin Wood's Ethereum vision at Devcon 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BvvUlKDqp0) (video)\n- [Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum introduction at Devcon 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjwr-7PgpN8) (video)\n- [Joseph Lubin's interview on building decentralized applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgLmY9oedTM) (video)\n- [BBC explains Ethereum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X33lgMbvdI) (video)\n- [Techcrunch on Ethereum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfULutvxvzY) (video)\n- [ELI5 attempts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/60hhjm/eli5_what_is_ethereum/), [this one is pretty good](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6gkd6v/welcome_to_rethtrader_new_people_let_me_save_you/dir6ah6/) :-)\n- Ethereum: [A Visual Explanation](http://veenspace.com/ethereum).\n\n### Where do I start?\n\nYou want to start by getting yourself set up with a wallet.

Examples of inappropriate behavior include:\n\n- Personal insults\n- Threats of violence or attempts to organize attacks\n- Slurs of any kind\n- Posting people’s private information\n\nIf you can't play nice with others, you will not be allowed to post here.\n\n### Ether Price, Market, and Mining discussions\n\nDiscussion related to the price of ether, buying, trading, market speculation, or any other price/market talk should be posted on /r/ethtrader, a third-party Subreddit not moderated by us. Besides, keep mining discussion to Subreddits such as /r/EtherMining and obvious ICO advertisements to r/ethinvestor or similar.\n\n### Duplicate threads\n\nDuplicate threads may be deleted. It is up to the discretion of the mods.\n\n### No spamming or drive by posting\n\nSpamming will lead to post deletion and a possible ban. Posts created by accounts that self-delete immediately will be deleted right away - no _drive by posting_.\n\n### Using multiple accounts\n\nCreating multiple accounts to get around Reddit or Subreddit rules is not allowed and will likely result in a permanent ban.\n\n### Misleading titles\n\nPosts with purposely misleading or unsubstantiated titles will be removed.\n\n### Karma &amp; age requirements for posting submissions\n\nAll post submissions should be made from accounts at least ten days old with a minimum of 20 comment karma.

We will not censor posts based on personal ideology and welcome constructive discourse.\n\n### What we ask our users\n\n- Please utilize the up-vote and down-vote buttons. This is a built-in moderation tool that is very powerful.\n- If you submit a report about a post or comment, please provide as much detail as possible to help us more quickly sort through our reported posts/comments.\n- Please don’t report posts or comments you disagree with, only about things that break the rules.\n- We welcome discussions about other crypto-currencies and Ethereum implementations, but if the topic is already being extensively covered by other threads, we kindly ask you to consider posting it to a more specific Subreddit. You can check an extensive (but not comprehensive) list of Ethereum-related Subreddits on the [""All Ethereum"" Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/all_ethereum/m/all_ethereum).\n\n### Moderation logs\n\nThe moderation logs are [public and available for review here](http://snew.github.io/r/ethereum/about/log).\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n---\n\n- [How would I **explain Ethereum** to a non-technical friend?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/45)\n- [What are the Ethereum **disk space needs**?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/143)\n- [What is **""gas""** and **transaction fee** in Ethereum?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/3)\n- [What is the **total supply** of Ether?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/443)\n- [Help with **very slow Mist sync**!](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/603)\n- [How to **backup** mist wallets?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/946)\n- [How do I **backup** my ether accounts?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/108)\n- [What is the recommended way to **safely store Ether**?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/1239)\n- [How to **reduce the chances** of your Ethereum wallet **getting hacked**?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/3887)\n- [How do I **buy Ethereum** with USD?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/1915)\n- [How can I get a Geth node to **download the blockchain quickly**?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/392)\n- [**How to mine** Ether on GNU + Linux?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/111)\n- [**Ropsten** testnet is under kind of attack?

I don't have a tech-background but recently I have read more and more about cryptography, blockchains, but also the origins of the computer, the architecture of the internet, and modern practices of censorship and security.\n\nI was wondering how resilient Bitcoin, Ethereum or the likes are towards the increasing threat of a far reaching censorship of the internet (for example the increasing efforts in China, but also attacks in the US and Europe). Can government efficiently censor the internet now to a degree that could effectively end public blockchain use for all but the most tech-savvy users?\n\nCould ISPs for example block Bitcoin or Ethereum for good through practices like Deep Packet Inspections? Is there always a viable alternative or is a perfect censorship of the internet nowadays conceivable?\n\nI'm also generally interested in articles that explain how the internet can now be censored and if there is a point at which users will just be out of options to circumvent censorship (for example VPNs).\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7xi96p/can_the_blockchain_be_censored_away/,0,10
