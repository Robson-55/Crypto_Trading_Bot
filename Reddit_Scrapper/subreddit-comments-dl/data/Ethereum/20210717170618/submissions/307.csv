7umn5q,1517524239,Vitalik should meet Yuval.,"Watch this video: https://youtu.be/npfShBTNp3Q\nWill the Future Be Human? - Yuval Noah Harari at the WEF Annual Meeting 2018\n\nAs I am reaching the end of the video, I find myself mostly in complete agreement with Yuval, aside from on his conclusion: no mention of blockchain at all.\n\nI think Vitalik should meet Yuval because as we are closing in on the scalability issues (I believe so), we are heading towards our next big problem: how do we deal with governance. Answering this question might indeed define the future of humanity.\n\nYuval doesn't have the answer, but a talk with Vitalik could probably go a long way as well as be very educational for people interested by this question (many).\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7umn5q/vitalik_should_meet_yuval/,5,3

7unxn0,1517536244,Looking for developers interested in startup crowdfunding project.,"Hello all,\n\nMe and a small team are in the initial brainstorming phases of a project to fund startups and other business ventures using an ETH token. Several other companies are pursuing related concepts, however this is novel in that our aim is to be totally SEC compliant and transparent.\n\nThis is not going to be DAO. Human oversight will serve as a ""crypto-gap"" to ensure that no funds are stolen due to weaknesses in the code.\n\nOur general model is a hybrid autonomous corporation, where investors contribute to a community ethereum pot which is used to fund ventures. In exchange, investors receive our company token which entitles it's bearer to a fractional percentage of that pot as well as votes in the company's decisions and which ventures are funded.\n\nAs the companies become successful the profits (or part of the profits) are fed back into the pot which increases the value of the company coin. The company would be owned by the token holder and would be overseen by an elected corporate board.\n\nWe already had a conversation with a SEC consulting firm that believes that it could be possible to legally create such an entity.\n\nWe are looking for a dedicated individual with moderate to advanced ETH Dev experience (smart contracts, custom token generation, and Dapp development) to serve as the head of tech development for the project. The dev should be enthusiastic, responsible, and most importantly excited for this project. We are offering co-founder status and equity in the company as compensation.\n\nFeel free to message if you are interested in learning more, are interested in the position, or have suggestions on how to improve the concept.\n\nThanks!\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7unxn0/looking_for_developers_interested_in_startup/,1,1

7uokaa,1517542592,"Besides the benefits decentralization brings, what other reason would people have to using the Ethereum network in the future?","Disclaimer: I'm a proponent of Ethereum and a believer towards the mass adoption of blockchain, crypto tokens, and it's unknown effect of the world. I often talk about the current state as being in the year 1996 and like to think that is approximately where we're at in terms of an analogy some of us can relate to.\n\n\nI recently had a discussion with someone about this topic and their position was that the only benefits Ethereum would [bring] are solely due to the effects of decentralization. I'm assuming those benefits are immutability, protection against censorship, lower dependence of trust, transparency, open development, economic staking, and uptime.\n\n\nOn the topic of adoption of the tokenized economy, he also questioned why people would use a stable coin like DAI in the first place instead of fiat? We can speculate that the transaction costs and/or speed would provide a better value proposition for many applications, but what else are we missing here?\n\n\nIs it the combination of being turing complete and decentralized that leaves open applications that wouldn't be possible otherwise or thought of yet? https://www.stateofthedapps.com/ Did we all just drink the Kool Aid?\n\n\nWould appreciate a genuine discussion and can't wait to read what others have to say as I'm optimistic about Ethereum. I also wanted to thank those who have and are positively contributing towards the ecosystem--we need more people like you as crypto can touch all facets of our world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7uokaa/besides_the_benefits_decentralization_brings_what/,5,2
