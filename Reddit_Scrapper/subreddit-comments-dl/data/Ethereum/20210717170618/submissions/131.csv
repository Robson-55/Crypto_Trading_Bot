7jqg2p,1513241945,ELI5: Proof of Stake,"Okay, so I think I've got a reasonably good understanding of what proof of work is, and how it functions behind the scenes a bit (with searching for a hash that proofs that you searched for a hash so that a hacker has to constantly out-hash everyone to add a false block to the chain)\n\nBut how does proof of stake work? So far I know that if you have ETH you can use it to stake or something and then... more ETH? I don't get it. Can someone tell me what this is, but also tell me why it is similar to PoW in making sure the blocks are correct etc...\n\nAlso how many ETH do I need to eventually participate in PoS, and what do I need to do that?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jqg2p/eli5_proof_of_stake/,2,1

The reason is that I'm doing a project to evaluate use of blockchain technology in IoT. \n\nI have managed to find the array I'm looking for using geth console and eth.getStorageAt(addr, key), where key is 0 in this case, as the array is first in the contract. It returns the size of the array, which has helped me to verify that I'm looking in the right place, but I haven't found a way to read the actual contents of the array.\n\nHow do I read array content using geth console?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jqiqs/how_to_read_smart_contract_arrays_with_geth/,8,0

Yesterday I contributed to the EOS project and after the window ended (this morning for me, around 10AM UK time) I tried claiming my EOS tokens using the ""claimAll"" function in MEW. I've pretty much spent ¬£15 in terms of transactions just on the gas payments - it's getting ridiculous. They keep failing, and I set my gas limit to 90000 (as suggested in guides all around) with 21 gwei. \n\nI don't get though why I should pay for transactions that fail? If they run out of gas, surely that's unforseeable and the ETH used for the transaction should be returned to the user. It's really unfortunate.\n\nNeither of these are my transactions, but looking at this:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x1b826e0af8c9c0f54719cb5cd8ba5396e0da2de6c44fd585486d9b035a58d4f6\n\nand this:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x76dd67fa4469d6b6c03c9b7a2609f1b9411ef40f9423b2b585a6a1845affd01a\n\nI have no idea why one is failing and the other is successful. Why are there so many failures?
