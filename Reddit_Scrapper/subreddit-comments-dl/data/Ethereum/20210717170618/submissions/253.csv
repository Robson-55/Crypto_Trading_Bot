7que5n,1516127581,Looking for some crypto Marketing experts,"Hello everyone,\n\nNot sure if this kind of post is accepted here but I thought it would be a good idea to try it out. \n\nI recently released [KryptoWar](https://kryptowar.com) a war game based on the Ethereum Blockchain. While I am really excited about how it took off (dozens of armies being purchased, thousands of soldiers and +150 battles in 10 days) I believe that some marketing/communication help would be useful to spread the word about [KryptoWar](https://kryptowar.com) and make the game better for our users.\n\nIf you are a Marketing guy familiar about the technology and interested in dApps feel free to PM me, maybe we can work together! This is of course a paid position (weekly salary paid in ETH).\n\nThank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7que5n/looking_for_some_crypto_marketing_experts/,5,6

You can find it at [blockchain.legal.io](https://blockchain.legal.io).\n\nThere is a lot of legal uncertainty in this space right now, and I'd love to play a part in making good resources available to the community at large. This type of information / education will be crucial in helping the ecosystem develop and mature. This seems particularly relevant to the Ethereum ecosystem, as there is still A LOT of confusion amongst the legal profession and the public at large around what a smart contract is / can do, and how it can affect the legal system going forwards. \n\nThings I'm wondering about:\n\n* any immediate feedback on the portal (design, usability)?\n* have you encountered any legal questions that should be covered here?\n* do you know any attorneys specializing in this space that you would recommend?\n\nIt's still very early stage, but wanted to get feedback at this point.
