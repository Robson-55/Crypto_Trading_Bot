When I check this balance on Etherscan, the balance does not match up with the amount of coins I have.  The blockchain balance is around $30 USD shorter than what I have on Binance.  Is that expected?\n* Is there anything special I need to do in order to transfer these coins off of the exchange to an Ethereum address?  Could I just use my Nano or MEW address, and just withdraw it directly?  I'm hesitant and don't want to lose my funds, but I'd prefer not to keep them on an exchange.\n\nSorry for the beginner question but I just want to make sure I'm doing this correctly.
