7dpc61,1510965546,Can wallet password be changed?,"I made a wallet around 2016 and I can't open it for some reason. I know my password is right, because I have used it before few months ago. I keep copies of my password 1. in a paper. 2. my computer 3. external hard drive.   They are all matching.\nMy passwords work for all the other wallets. It's just this one that is not working. The only difference is the password for the wallet that im trying to use is relatively shorter than others so it might have gotten hack(although all the funds are still in there). Can wallet password be changed?\nAlso, does Mist have to be in sync in order to send? mine is partially synced (400k blockchain more to go). Since myetherwallet.com doesnt work for this wallet, im trying to send it on mist",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7dpc61/can_wallet_password_be_changed/,9,3

Is this correct?\n\nAlso, I know solidity and Viper currently works, but those are languages especially written for ethereum. Are there others? Are there others planned?\n\nA lot of the hype for blockchains like Lisk and Stratis is based on they supporting more common languages, with JavaScript for Lisk and C# for Stratis I believe.
