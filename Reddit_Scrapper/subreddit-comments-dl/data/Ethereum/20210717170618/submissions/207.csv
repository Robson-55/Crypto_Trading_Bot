7oblnp,1515163428,Etherions - 3D-WebGL game of collectible dragon whelps on the Ethereum blockchain,"I'm the person who posted a few weeks ago about my [virtual real estate dapp](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lhm81/any_interest_in_an_ethereumtycoon_game_where_you/) which is under development. Seeing as it is a fairly complex idea, blockchain wise, I thought it would be good practice to test making a smaller and simpler dapp first. So over the holiday season I made a small collectible game of dragon whelps, “Etherions”, which are stored on the blockchain.\n\nhttps://www.etherions.com/\n\nIts a bit different from other collectible dapps since its actual 3D whelps who will walk around, sleep, and play with their siblings. They will grow stronger everyday. You'll need to nurse them and from a certain age they may do battle with other dragons.\n\nAging is currently limited to 30 days during which the Etherions will grow from hatchlings to sizable whelps. Depending on community input I can extend the aging to a year, during which the growth process will continue to full-fledged dragons. Full-grown Etherions are much stronger in battle and should be worth substantially more than their hatchling counterparts, especially the rarer variations. Early buyers have the advantage of having the oldest and thereby strongest etherions for quite a while until they reach the aging-cap.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7oblnp/etherions_3dwebgl_game_of_collectible_dragon/,26,40
