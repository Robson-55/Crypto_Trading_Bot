This is why I wanted to come up with a secure, fast and distributed system.\n\nMy idea is that a dao should allow anyone to submit numbers that affect everyone but them and reward people for doing so. In order to request a random number one has to submit their own, contributing to the system.\n\nA draft implementation can be found in [the github repository](https://github.com/sz-piotr/ethereum-true-rng). \n\nI would love to know what you think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ry3wr/i_am_working_on_a_random_number_generator_dao/,1,6

7rybty,1516549116,Ethereum basic terminology in layman's terms (ELI5 Glossary),"I'll try my best to explain some of the common terminology used in cryptocurrencies \(specifically Ethereum\) in the easiest way possible so that even a child could \(hopefully\) understand. Feel free to ask any questions or point out what I might've missed in the comments.\n\n**Ethereum Wallet**: Ethereum Wallet is like an *unbreakable piggybank* made of bullet\-proof glass, and there are more piggybanks in existence than there are atoms in the universe so you can have as many of them as you would like. Now, each piggybank comes with a unique magic glove that lets anyone who wears that glove reach inside the piggybank and take stuff. Anyone who knows which piggybank belongs to you can drop coins of different kind and colors into it, they can also look inside it and see what kind of coins you have and how many of each but they cannot break it or steal your coins without wearing your magic glove.\n\n**Address**: Piggybanks \(Ethereum Wallets\) exist in the magical space of the Internet, and there is so many of them. In order for other people to drop coins into your piggybank, they first need to know which piggybank belongs to you. Your address is a long word that shows which piggybank is yours, it's typically 40 characters long string starting with 0x and consists of numbers and letters a through f.\n\n**Private Key**: This is your magic glove that you wear in order to take something from your piggybank, but you have to be very careful because if someone else finds your magic glove, they can steal everything that you keep inside your piggybank! If you lose your magic glove, you lose access to your stuff inside the piggybank. Magic gloves are one\-of\-a\-kind, each magic glove only lets you in one specific piggybank and vice versa. In the magic Internet land, it's a 64 character long string, it can be used to find where your piggybank is or to send coins to other piggybanks.\n\n**Keystore / JSON**: A piggybank can arrive in a locked box that needs a password to open. This is the box that holds your magic gloves to access the contents of your piggybank, but it can only be opened with the correct password. Anyone who knows the password and has the keystore can take coins from the piggybank associated with it.\n\n**Mnemonic Phrase**: A piggybank can also be given to you by a fairy that whispers some very special words in your ear. Those words can be used to summon the magic glove which lets you take stuff from inside your piggybank. These words are very special, never tell them to anyone else because anyone who knows what the fairy told you can take whatever you have in your piggybank.\n\n**Smart Contract**: Coins aren't the only things that piggybank can hold, there are a few special piggybanks that have a genie living inside them! Genies are intelligent creatures that have their own rules and can follow your instructions. You can interact with the genies inside other piggybanks if you know their rules, different genies can do different stuff for you. But be very careful, because some of the genies can be evil. Always make sure you understand what a genie does before talking to him.\n\n**Ether / Wei**: One of the most important coins that you can keep in your piggybank is called a Wei, cute name isn't it? But Wei is very small so a HUGE number of these small Weis come together to make an Ether. One Ether is made of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 \(one with 18 zeroes!\) Weis.\n\n**ERC20 Token**: Some genies have the special ability to make new coins with different shapes and colors! If you give them your Ethers or Weis, they can give you colored coins back in exchange. Some genies may promise to do things for you if you own coins that are the same color as them, but be careful because some of them might lie to steal your precious Ethers and give you their useless colored coins.\n\n**Transaction**: In order to send coins from one piggybank to another, you need to put your magic gloves on, put your hand in the bank, take whatever coin you want to send, then give them to the magic fairy to carry them for you; you can even include a message for the genies if you would like! But the fairy doesn't work for free, you have to give some of your Weis to the fairy so she would deliver the rest of the coins and your optional message to the other piggybank or genie.\n\n**GWei**: Fairies that deliver messages and coins often demand their payment in GWeis. The G that's stuck to the back of Wei means Giga, just like GigaByte. Giga is 1,000,000,000 \(one with 9 zeroes\) of anything, so a GigaWei or GWei for short is 0.000000001 Ethers or 1000000000 Weis.\n\n**Gas Limit**: This is how many seconds the fairy has to fly to reach the piggybank plus how long she has to talk with the genie inside the piggybank \(if there is one\) at most. The longer it takes for the fairy to deliver your coins and message, the more you have to pay her. But you can never know in advance exactly how long she will have to talk with the genie so instead you need to tell her how many seconds of her time you are willing to pay for at most. If the delivery takes less than what you agreed, she will give the change back to you, otherwise she will fly away without finishing the talk with the genie and keep your payment in full. If you're just sending coins to piggybanks without a genie inside, it usually only takes 21000 seconds of any fairy's time. For piggybanks with a genie inside, delivering your message can take over 150000 seconds of her time.\n\n**Gas Price**: This is how much GWeis you will pay the fairy for every second her time. Don't confuse this with the Gas Limit. Gas Limit is how many seconds of fairy's time you can take maximum, Gas Price is how much you pay for every second of her time. Fairies will deliver coins and messages with higher payment first, so you must keep in mind that when they're busy, you have to pay them more for each second of their time. The more you pay the fairy, the faster she will deliver your coins and message.\n\n**Actual Transaction Fee**: This is how much total you pay the fairy to deliver your coin and messages. If you multiply how many seconds of fairy's time you took by how much you agreed to pay for every second, you get the total fee that you will pay her. \n\n**Nonce**: In order for the fairies to keep track of what order the coins and messages were sent in, they will ask you how many times you have sent stuff in the past. For example, if you're sending coins for the 5th time, then your current Nonce is five.\n\n**Transaction Data**: This is the message that the fairy will tell to the genie, if you're just sending coins it should be empty.\n\n**Mining**: New Wei coins can be created by the fairies as a reward for delivering coins and messages between piggybanks, this is how fairies earn money by getting these rewards and fees that people pay them.\n\n**Proof of Work**: In order for a fairy to claim their reward for delivering coins and messages, they need to prove that they were successful. Fairies live inside your computers, most of them reside in graphic cards. They work their magic by doing very complex math stuff that they can later show as a proof that they were delivering coins and messages successfully and receive their rewards.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7rybty/ethereum_basic_terminology_in_laymans_terms_eli5/,28,17

7rzxrv,1516563672,Iâ€™m a dumb noob: please help me understand governance of Dapps,"I am rapidly evolving from a brainless cryptocurrency speculator to a brainless crypto speculator with a genuine interest in the civilizational implications of blockchain technology and Ethereum as a smart contract platform. Specifically, the potential for Dapps to disrupt economic models where intermediaries capture economic rents that would otherwise accrue to providers and users (eg airbnb, uber) is obvious. Combined with the growing disintermediation of payments and the incorporation of the internet of things, among countless other applications, and the possibilities seem fucking mindblowing.\n\nThat said, I still think a totally decentralized model for a large scale economic enterprise seems totally impractical. Iâ€™m not reflexively skeptical of the value of specialization and having smart, trustworthy people make key strategic decisions on behalf of an economic enterprise. in other words, paradoxically, it seems like some centralization of a Dapp seems necessary. Otherwise itâ€™d be incredibly inefficient to try and make every decision facing the application via consensus of all token holders.\n\nhave people thought about this at all? what are some solutions people have proposed? off the top of my head i can think of mechanisms for delegating votes to trusted token holders or decentralized applications that identify trusted decision makers for otherwise decentralized applications. can you point me to reading material on this issue specifically? \n\nSeparately, what mechanisms have people proposed to incentivize developers to make improvements and fixes to the application over time?\n\nApologies if these seem like old questions, but iâ€™m incredibly new to the space and eager to learn.
