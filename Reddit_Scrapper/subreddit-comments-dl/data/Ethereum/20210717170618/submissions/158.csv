7l7vet,1513840383,Is there a gas limit per block at which point a typical PC would take longer than 15s to process the transactions?,"I guess Im wondering how long we can keep up the on chain scaling before people start requiring dedicated hardware to run a node.\n\nI do feel there is a grain of truth in bitcoin core's assertion that on chain scaling can lead to centralisation. But only a grain- no need for people to need to be able to run a node on a raspberry pi (which presumably is already impossible).\n\nBtw, the above assumes the main bottleneck is cpu, am I right? Breeding cats, for example, is cpu intensive but not bandwidth intensive. Or will my PC pass relevant calculations over to the gpu? If not - if it's all about cpu, isn't there scope for improvements here? \n\nFinally- is it possible to equate specific cpus with specific gas limit? 'pentium X can be used to run an ethereum node with gas limit up to 200m' for example? \n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7l7vet/is_there_a_gas_limit_per_block_at_which_point_a/,6,5

First tried to download full node but it stuck at the last 190 blocks kept downloading chain structure.I tried waiting it out and left the pc running for the night when i woke up it was at 30m chain structure and kept going.So this time i tried running it at light client option.Activated light client opened the mist again and it started synching this time it actually synced to the end but when it was %100 it said looking for peers and it stopped there. Now when i open the mist it says ethereum node needs to synch and looking for peers.If i click launch application it says 4(it is growing) hours since last block. I tried running node on manual. \nwith; ""geth.exe --fast --cache 1024""\nthat keeps going too. What i don't understand is it was able to find peers and sync. What happened?
