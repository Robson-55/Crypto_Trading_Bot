7pm1s4,1515649842,eth-button: a simple way to receive donations with Ethereum,"I tried posting this a couple weeks ago.  It looks like my account was too young at the time, so it never showed up.  I tried again recently, but I think it was deleted for being a duplicate.\n\nIs the third time the charm?\n\n[eth-button](https://eth-button.github.io/eth-button/) is a simple, one-line method to accept donations on your site, through Mist or MetaMask.  It is meant to be very compact and minimalist, and to be as easy to configure as possible.  All that is required is the address at which you'd like to receive donations.\n\nI lack a good sense of design, so I'm looking for feedback or ideas on how to improve it.  I would like to keep it focused to on task, though, and rather than extending functionality, I would prefer to work on ensuring it works on as many surfaces as possible.\n\nIdeas, comments, issues, pull requests, and assorted feedback welcome!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7pm1s4/ethbutton_a_simple_way_to_receive_donations_with/,158,32

7pm5gy,1515651098,Trying to Solve a Security Dilemma with Limited Trust,"I'd like to get the community's thoughts on an idea for managing security of wallets. Likely this idea is either stupid or already well-known, I apologize for either case.  \n  \nSecurity of keys in Ethereum (crypto generally) is problematic. To avoid theft we need to keep our keys as guarded as possible; however, to avoid loss we need to make sure our keys (or recovery mnemonics) are written down in multiple locations known to us. There is no practical difference between having your key stolen and losing/forgetting your key - your currency is lost without recourse. From a theft perspective it is best to not keep your keys written down anywhere, and from a loss perspective it is best to tattoo your keys on your forehead. These are obviously incompatible.  \n  \nI'm thinking of solving this with a kind of ""chain of limited trust"" (COLT to make it easier here). What if I were to spread my key out among a number of people (let's say 8) in my trusted social circle, who would then entrust me with a portion of their private key? For purposes of this example I'll assume all in the COLT are using hardware wallets and have written down their 24-word mnemonic.  \n  \nI order my COLT alphabetically - they are listed with their wallet addresses:  \n* 1. Alice: 0x001...  \n* 2. Bob: 0x002...  \n* 3. Charles: 0x003...  \n* 4. Diane: 0x004...  \n* 5. Elaine: 0x005...  \n* 6. Fred: 0x006...  \n* 7. George: 0x007...  \n* 8. Harold: 0x008...  \n  \nI then give 3 mnemonic words to each of them, beginning with Alice (mnemonics 1, 2, and 3) through Harold (mnemonics 22, 23, and 24). It's not completely safe for my COLT to write these down and keep them, so they're going to store these words for me on the blockchain so they're never lost. The words will be sha-256 (or keccak) encrypted using their own private key as salt before going onto the blockchain so only they will be able to retrieve them.   \n  \nNow, a hardware wallet does not expose a private key and the goal is for nobody to know their own private keys anyway. Instead of using the key itself as the salt for the hash we can use a signed transaction ID, with the following fixed parameters to make it deterministic:  \n**To address**: address of next person in the COLT (so Alice uses Bob's address, Harold uses Alice's, etc.)  \n**Amount**: 0  \n**Nonce**: same as 'To address' (not sure about this, depends on the data type of nonce because we don't want overflows, just want to ensure it's unique and deterministic)  \n  \nUsing the hardware wallet we can sign the transaction above offline, then hash the following concatenated string:  \n    &lt;0-23 index of mnemonic word&gt;-&lt;mnemonic word&gt;-&lt;transaction id&gt;  \nOnce the hash is created, the transaction ID is deleted. This resulting hash is stored on the blockchain - it can either go into a contract somewhere, or be transaction data, whatever. Just so long as it can be found later. This setup is done for every one of the COLT, resulting in 24 x 9 hashes stored on the blockchain. Everyone then destroys the sheet where they've written down their mnemonics.  \n  \nIn the best case scenario, nobody ever loses their hardware wallet or forgets their pin code. When someone does need their mnemonic however, either because they've lost or are locked out of their wallet, their account was somehow compromised (pin leaked), or they just got a shiny new ledger they'd like to initialize, the following can be done:  \n  \nThe COLT (everyone except for the person who needs their mnemonic restored) re-create the transaction ID with the same parameters as above. Then, they iterate through the list of mnemonic words from BIP-39, concatenating the mnemonic index and transaction ID and hashing until they match what was originally stored on the blockchain. Each one in the COLT then provides the mnemonic words back to the one person needing a restore. If the account was actually compromised and not just lost, the COLT must now assume that the attacker possesses 3 of their 24 mnemonic words and all should transfer their funds to another wallet and start again with newly initialized hardware wallets.  \n  \nIt will be somewhat problematic if multiple individuals in the COLT lose access to their wallet at the same time. 2 is probably reasonable, because each one of the two will be able to recover 21 of 24 words and a program can be written simply to brute-force the other 3 in not a terribly long time. 3 losing access simultaneously is harder - I don't know how long it would take to brute-force 6 mnemonic words but it could be unreasonable unless some serious computing power were devoted to the task. To guard against this I'd propose using a canary (perhaps bi-monthly) so everyone is always aware of whether their COLT is in control of their wallets.  \n  \nIt kind of goes without saying that all of these steps would be automated with simple applications (some offline) instead of having people do all of these steps by hand.  \n  \nSorry for the long post, but this is something I've been thinking of and am curious to get some feedback on viability and whether there are massive holes I'm missing. Yes, trust is involved but I know for myself there are others in my life who I would certainly trust with a portion of my private key.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7pm5gy/trying_to_solve_a_security_dilemma_with_limited/,15,21

7pmvub,1515661427,"Just learned Bitcoin, now trying to learn Ethereum","The idea of a decentralized server is fascinating to me. But I have some unanswered questions.\n\nI understand that a smart contract is operational code that is sent to the miners to execute, and I pay a fee for the compute power. However, if I send a smart contract that executes the following scenario: \n\nAlice sends Bob 5 GenericERC20 Tokens if Bob has an GenericERC20 balance of less than 50.\n\nHow does the if statement trigger? Does every ethereum block contain code to check whether or not Bob's balance has gone under 0? Another way to put it is...does the smart contract code get stored in each subsequent block and that computation gets run every time a new block gets added? If so, who pays for that compute power? \n\nOr am I totally misinterpreting smart contracts and the ability to automatically check balances.\n\nAnother question I had in mind is creating a new ERC20 token. A new token is basically a smart contract with the contract address and balance amount, right? Does that mean every new block that gets added to the blockchain contains smart contract code for every ERC20 token imaginable? I am guessing that would be really inefficient storage of data. \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated. Just trying to learn!
