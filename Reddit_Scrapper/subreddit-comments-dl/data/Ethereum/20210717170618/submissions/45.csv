7dt7n3,1511015287,Wallet Shitcoins Cleanup,Hey\n\nHow do you guys clean up your wallets of those shitcoins airdrops? Particularly those that apparently can't be transferred such as Jury.Online (0xdb455c71c1bc2de4e80ca451184041ef32054001) or CoinCrowd (0x4d829f8c92a6691c56300d020c9e0db984cfe2ba).\n\nThanks!,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7dt7n3/wallet_shitcoins_cleanup/,14,17

7dtq1u,1511020632,"Introducing Toastycoin Frontier, where payers get work, workers get ether, and scammers get burned.","Some of you may remember my [ether-burning stunt](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/61t5c8/i_just_burned_1_eth_on_purpose_for_my_next_trick/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) about 7 months ago. Under the alt u/ethist, I burned 1 ETH straight out, then put another 15.5 ETH into four simple ""Burnable Payment"" smart contracts.\n\nRead a detailed write-up of how it all went [here](https://medium.com/@coinop.logan/toasted-money-4fb07492acf3), but long story short: 6.5 ETH was released to workers for infographics and technical support, 1 ETH was burned, and the rest was recovered. All of this without any reputation or supporting infrastructure.\n\n[In one case](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/61t5c8/i_just_burned_1_eth_on_purpose_for_my_next_trick/dfh23az/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=ethereum), I opened a BP and left the computer. When I came back less than 12 hours later, a worker had committed and offered a solution. Shortly after, he implemented it and I released the payment. **I know of no other system, in crypto or otherwise, that offers such effortless outsourcing of work.**\n\nWith my convictions about BPs vindicated, I started working hard on an easy-to-use interface for BPs, with some help from u/etherboyi.\n\n###I'm proud to present [Toastycoin Frontier](http://toastycoin.com/), the first in a series of tools designed to harness the power of Burnable Payments.\n\nToastycoin makes it easy to [browse and interact with the set of all BPs](http://toastycoin.com/browse.html), or [create your own BPs](http://toastycoin.com/create.html). See also [a simple example of BP use](http://toastycoin.com/example.html), or read more about [the game theory](http://toastycoin.com/gametheory.html) that makes Burnable Payments so effective.\n\n(The Burnable Payment contract itself has undergone [some minor changes](http://toastycoin.com/BPchanges.html), but the major behavior is unchanged. See the new Factory contract and source code [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x38b394cd27c3b0d865f58a4512b65c7b0ab6db66#code).)\n\nThere are very few applications on Ethereum that have non-Ethereum-related, immediately practical utility. Toastycoin can make this claim, while using extremely simple smart contract logic and absolutely no supporting infrastructure other than a web3 interface. No ICO, no company, no server, no license--and it works today. [All hail game theory!](http://toastycoin.com/gametheory.html)\n\nI've put 4 ETH up for a combination of Toastycoin upgrade work and sillier BPs aimed at testing the limits of the system. Feel free to comment here with questions on any open payment you see from me (0xFCe18...). Just to give you a taste, here are a few of the BPs I've opened:\n\n- [Javascript method to sanitize and apply markdown formatting to a piece of unsafe text](http://www.toastycoin.com/interact.html?address=0x33820bc3825aafda45e805de4b07c003e0415547) (0.3 ETH)\n- [Spraypaint an Ethereum wizard](http://www.toastycoin.com/interact.html?address=0x8ae9de8c9609f5a0f825b5ffa47beafbb89c2b6a) (0.5 ETH)\n- ~~[Make a email-notification server for BPs](http://toastycoin.com/interact.html?address=0xbd784bd52291c80fa74cb5b43694f29c3ceec885) (0.6 ETH)~~ (Committed / worker found)\n- ~~[Write a Haiku about Burnable Payments](http://www.toastycoin.com/interact.html?address=0x2bbb786608e439b92121c2e09deadbff96d04155) (50 mETH)~~ (Committed / worker found)\n\n(Protip: etherscan.io has a ""watch list"" feature. This is what I use to get email notifications of actions on my Burnable Payments, until a dedicated notification tool is built. You can even watch the [Factory contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x38b394cd27c3b0d865f58a4512b65c7b0ab6db66#code) to be notified when new BPs are opened.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7dtq1u/introducing_toastycoin_frontier_where_payers_get/,80,58

How will the transition to the rent-based model look like?
