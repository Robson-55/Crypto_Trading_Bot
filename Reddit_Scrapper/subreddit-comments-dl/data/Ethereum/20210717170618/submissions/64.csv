7fn7cl,1511706742,Need some help getting into Ethereum!,"Hi all,\n\nSo i've been lurking on this subreddit for a while and have been aware of cryptos for a few years now. I purchased some ethereum when it was around 170 earlier this year and ended up selling but I never really knew that much about why the price was where it was. I am looking to this sub to help me start to really understand it in its entirety and hopefully begin making some actual decisions based on research. It seems like everyone is helpful in this sub so I figured I might as well post a few questions and see if anyone can help out.\n\n\nTo begin, I have a UK bank account but I'm studying abroad here from the states so I will probably be buying the currency on a US based wallet/site. I know many sites have begun trading ETH so if anyone could refer me to what they think is the best site to deal with that would be amazing.\n\nAlso, the questions below are ones I have had for a while and would love to have answered:\n\n* What is the simplest way for me to understand Ethereum in laymans terms?\n* What is the difference between ether and ethereum?\n* How do ICOs work and how would I access them?\n* How do I start learning about ethereum / What are some good sources to begin reading?\n* What are some basic concepts I need to know about ETH or surrounding companies?\n* Are there any tips for specific sites to check on a regular basis for information about ETH?\n* Do you guys have any tips for a college student who has the time / drive to dive into this complicated subject to learn all about it?\n\n\n\nThank you guys so much I'm sure if I can get answers to a few of these questions it will set me on the right path.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7fn7cl/need_some_help_getting_into_ethereum/,6,5
