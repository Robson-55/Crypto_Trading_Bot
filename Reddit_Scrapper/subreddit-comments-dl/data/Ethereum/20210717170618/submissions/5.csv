Assume following invoice variables are entered by buyer on order webpage:\n\n    userID\n    productID\n    price\n    quantity\n\nBuy is confirmed when buyer sends minimum needed ETH (total cost) to a unique address of which we have private key.\n`sha256(all_variables_concatenated)` is stored on blockchain.
