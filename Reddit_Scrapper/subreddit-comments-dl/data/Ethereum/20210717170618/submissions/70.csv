7g5te6,1511890446,Questions about how Proof-of-Stake will work...,"How will forking work after the switch to Proof-of-Stake? People are understandably negative toward contentious forks, but non-contentious forks are the mechanism for upgrading the software. Because of costs, miners can only really mine one chain, and will follow the most profitable chain eventually. This means buyers determine the state of the fork via mass adoption and valuation in proof-of-work systems, right? Trying to wrap my head around proof-of-stake. Because staking will require so much less computing power, in the case of a fork, stakers could conceivably run both chains. What incentive is there for them not to? I don't want to see the ETH ecosystem devolve into the sort of misinformation campaigns like those in the extended bitcoin universe. Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond. BitcoinCash4Gold(/jk) etc. Ugh. Those happen even though mining is costly and should disincentivize such behavior. So what about PoS and staking? Could this turn every fork into a contentious fork? What am I missing that inhibits such behavior?\n\nI'm thrilled about a technology that can transition cryptocurrency away from the insane amount of electricity wasted using Proof-of-Work mining. Bitcoin mining along uses more electricity than ~150 individual countries! I just want to make sure I understand the alternatives.\n\nAre the ETH rewards stakers receive going to come from transaction fees, newly created ETH, or both?\n\nI'm just curious and trying to wrap my head around how it will work. With mining, you're essentially competing with other miners for the reward (set per block), so if there are more miners, this decreases the chances of you getting the reward. Is it the same with with Staking? How about inflation/deflation? If most to all of the reward comes from newly created ETH, you've got an overall inflation rate dependent on how rewarding you make staking. If most to all of the reward for staking comes from transaction fees or 'gas', ETH could even become deflationary as ETH is accidentally lost over time by users in wallets that can no longer be accessed.\n\nWho decides those rates? Vitalik Buterin and other developers, or is there going to be some sort of internal government system with ETH holders, users, stakers, devs, dapp devs, getting some sort of vote?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7g5te6/questions_about_how_proofofstake_will_work/,1,5
