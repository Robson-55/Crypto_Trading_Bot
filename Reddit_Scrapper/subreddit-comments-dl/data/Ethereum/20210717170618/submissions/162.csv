7lhm81,1513951548,Any interest in an Ethereum-Tycoon game where you can earn (or lose) ETH by flipping virtual properties on the blockchain? (screenshots inside),"I'm making a (in-browser WebGL) game where you can buy virtual properties on the ETH blockchain, build a house on them Sims-style and resale them for a, hopefully, higher price. Is this something which interests HODLers?\n\nYou will be able to buy properties, build houses on them or improve existing ones, add furniture, landscaping and vehicles if so desired, then (try to) resale at a higher value. Or you can just own virtual properties on the blockchain.\n\nOf course for this kind of game a certain amount of centralization is still inevitable at this point, as with Cryptokitties et al. Storing whole house blueprints on the blockchain would currently cost a lot of gas for every transaction.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/tK1NyqJ.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/5sldgH7.jpg\n\nA game like this wouldn't be complete without a lambo prop ;)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/J61i4jY.jpg\n\nThere could be two models:\n\n1) The property value acts like a stock, where every buy increases the overall price, and every sale decreases it.\n\n2) You can just set your own sale value (like CryptoKitties) and hope to sell higher than that you bought it after customizing the property.\n\nWhat do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lhm81/any_interest_in_an_ethereumtycoon_game_where_you/,791,190

7lhux0,1513954171,Should Our Dapp Development Platform Offer Payment in ETH or Dollars first?,"What does this company do?\nHey everyone, I'm a part of a company that has been developing a DApp development platform that allows you to hook into both centralized and decentralized services with a simple UI. You can host everything yourself or have us host your IPFS, Golem, Ethereum nodes, etc... for you. \n\nWhat would I be paying for?\nThe way we make money is by charging for having us host your nodes. The main reason for this is to provide an easy way for people to get up and running with private node clusters in an sandbox environment before they are ready to go to a public testnet / mainnet or host and pin things themselves.\n\nWhy do I have to pick one?\nWe're planning a private alpha launch in January and don't have enough time to do both. The options are:\n- Pay $10 a month for the service and be charged to a traditional credit card.\n- Pay $120 equivalent in ETH based on the average of the last 7 days of its price for a year subscription. Ex: if the last 7 days of ETH's price were 100, 150, 200, 250, 200, 250, 300 you would pay $120 at ~$207 / ETH\n\nThe reason we are only doing a year for ETH is because you can't just charge an address like you can a credit card. Sure, you could create an escrow contract or something similar, but we want to keep it simple for now.\n\nWe're using this to inform our platform and would appreciate you putting your response in this survey or in a comment.\n\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/WZ2W9OR4HjMpVrW73",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lhux0/should_our_dapp_development_platform_offer/,3,2
