7wqvrm,1518325174,"Urgent request: research interview for PhD, information on why you got into Bitcoin and Crypto, what your experiences are and what your views are","Hi everyone. I'm looking for people to help me with some academic research on the social impact of bitcoin/ethereum and blockchain systems, and how you interact with them. I'm in the early stages of a PhD and have to complete some exercises and practice interviews in order to progress my advancement.\n\nThese interviews will not be published or end up in any reports, but are more of a preliminary research exploration in preparation for the full research project investigating the culture and social dimensions of cryptocurrency tech. This will help my understanding, and help me structure a robust project which will be able to receive funding from research commissions.\n\nI'd appreciate anyone's help as all your views are very valuable, and hope that my PhD will be of benefit in understanding and developing the future of cryptocurrencies. However, if you're any of the following, this would also be a massive help: * people who have created new start-up businesses with an interest in fintech * people who started trading * people applying these technologies internationally * or people who have attended community-type meetings that you'd find on websites such as meetup.com\n\nHappy to provide more information on request. Interview should be no more than half an hour, and I'd greatly appreciate your input and time. I'm hoping to carry out interviews within the next 48 hours.\n\nCross posting (in case you see this on other similar subreddits).",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wqvrm/urgent_request_research_interview_for_phd/,6,3

7wr5me,1518328780,"Ledger, MEW, uncertain what to do...","So, I just got my ledger nano s finally and I was looking forward to getting it set up this weekend. Until now, I have been using an offline version of MEW using the source from github. It's not that I don't trust them, it's that I don't trust anyone....\n\nThe ledger app currently says ""Due to the temporary instability of our ethereum nodes, we recommend users to use the Ledger integration of MEW."" iirc it also doesn't support erc tokens right?\n\nOk fine. go to my offline copy, and it doesn't actually work. it says ""Please use MyEtherWallet on a secure (SSL / HTTPS) connection to connect."" \n\nAfter all the drama this week, I'm not sure if I should continue trusting MEW to the extent that I have trusted them to this point (just a little). No idea what to do with mycrypto. I feel like 19/20 or whatever going one way is somewhat telling, but I don't love either option. \n\nShort of modifying the code myself, what does everyone else around here do? Are there any other options to use the ledger? I have the seed obviously, so presumably there would be a way in the future to get at it even if god forbid MEW ceases to exist in the future, but I don't love any of the options. \n\nEDIT UPDATE: Thanks to some suggestions here, I set up a local server with a self signed certificate to run a local version of MEW on my machine. Thanks to the links to their github, I found out that it is a browser limitation, not a MEW choice to not work with the ledger offline from ""file://...."". So a little bit of setup of MAMP, some certificate work to get chrome to trust it, and i'm happy with this solution.
