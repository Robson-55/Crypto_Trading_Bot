7gzpyz,1512178095,I may have lost my Ethereum wallet and need help. Reward.,"I don't know how to summarize this. Feeling pretty worried right now. If your reply results in me regaining access to my wallet, I'll send you $100 in Eth. My word is my bond.\n\nSo here goes. I know my public Eth address. I *thought* I had my private keyfile backed up. I now suspect I may have backed up the wrong keyfile. As in, the keyfile back up I have does not seem to match the public address I have been using. I am hoping I am wrong about this. I don't know how this could have happened. \n\nSo question #1: Given a public address, and a private key file, how can I see if the public address belongs to the private key? \n\nI used my backup, copied the files to %appdata%/ethereum, and everything looks good. The UTC--whatever keystore file is present. When I load Mist wallet, the public address I see is not the right public address. Do I just need to like... tell it about the public address or something? Or is it 1:1 and if the public address it loaded is wrong, my keyfile is wrong?\n\nPlease help. I will deliver on the reward even if it's as simple as some command to add the account back.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7gzpyz/i_may_have_lost_my_ethereum_wallet_and_need_help/,2,4

Related question - if the basic structure of eth and dapps is already developed, why are there hardly any dapps available? Like, why aren't there thousands of little dapps up and running for us to try out? Is it that obscure and difficult to use?\n\n3.

So the number of Ethereum one must have in this case should be : ""Amount of Eth the most Eth owner in the world has"" / ( number of validators x 51%)\n\n\nThis number need to be checked after every block and be updated.\n\n\nAny thoughts ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7h1yne/how_much_ethereum_should_you_have_to_become_a/,28,31
