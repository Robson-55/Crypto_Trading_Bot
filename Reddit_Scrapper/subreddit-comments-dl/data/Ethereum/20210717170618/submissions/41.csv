7ddr1d,1510851811,What Ethereum-based dApps will result in better business practices?,"I'm looking to compile a list of current and future dApps that would be useful for a small business to incorporate into their practices. For instance, today I was thinking about running BAT instead of having ads on a website. Sure, it might not make sense financially *right now*, but if I want to support the cryptocurrency ecosystem and gain some tokens in the process, I'm for it.   \n\n  \nI'm sure token management software will be big, especially if your business accepts many different forms, so maybe something such as Melonport could be used?   \n\nI'm pretty excited about DAO software as well, so any recommendations for people trying to make it easier for the layperson would be appreciated. Would be incredible to automate many day-to-day tasks via the blockchain!   \n  \nWhat other decentralized applications could a business incorporate right now or in the future that would be worth looking into?

7dfnly,1510867419,"Have an idea with no experience, a trend that will only go up.","I want to create a token called 'RISK' that deletes the overall supply in an reverse exponential fashion (more deletions at the start than a year into the program). It was my hope that the total supply would start at 1,000,000,000,000 tokens and end at 1 token. These would of course be divisible by 1,000,000.  \n\nI don't know how to program a token (or any for that matter) to delete the subdivisions in the coins. \n\nI'm not sure of the time frame this should be done in, but I'd like it to be over the course of a day. All the tokens would be pre mined and set up on a smart contract exchange for a total market cap token value of 1$. It's my hope supply and demand takes care of the rest. \n\nHow to randomly generate numbers that actually randomly delete tokens is beyond me. \n\nAnyone want to take this idea?
