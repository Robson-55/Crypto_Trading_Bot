7nv2bj,1514990748,We need a decentralized messaging system,"Hello,\n\nI saw someone writing about a decentralized messaging system the other day on this forum, but I can't find anything about it anymore. Maybe it was in Ethtrader. \n\nAnyway. This is what makes Ethereum so powerful: The ability to resist to censure. We need something like Twitter or Messenger build on Ethereum.

7nvako,1514993001,"Woah, we're bandwidth-hungry. Let's run a full node!","I've been running cryptocurrency nodes for years, but only added Ethereum to my basket in the last few months.  I revisited my setup recently and realized I could do more to help with light clients.  If you guys can, set up **geth** as a full node daemon (there are many guides), and then go above and beyond with the following:\n\n* Greatly increase maximum peers\n* Enable serving a large amount of light nodes (especially needed)\n* Allocate a large amount of CPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth\n\nIn my case, a VM is configured with 8 fast Xeon cores, 20GB of ECC RAM, fast striped RAID storage, and access to symmetric gigabit fiber.  I'm uploading terabytes per month and constantly chatting with hundreds of peers.  (Geth itself doesn't use the full 20GB, but Linux fills it up with frequently-accessed data from disk.)\n\nIt is unacceptable for newcomers to be bogged down by slow-loading clients; we need to maximize acceptance and thereby trust!\n\nAn ending thought on decentralization:  The more unique your computing environment, the more reason you should run a full node.  I'm running the above from a rural area with backup UPS+generator power, so I like to think I am in a position to ensure network stability in the event of larger threats like natural disasters, autonomous system outages, etc.  The cloud is awesome, but a thousand nodes all running in the same datacenter have at least a couple common points of failure...\n\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7nvako/woah_were_bandwidthhungry_lets_run_a_full_node/,117,88

7nvz6b,1514999140,PSA: Please spread this to enable people accessing their frozen funds due to 'wrong password' errors.,"Hello, \n\nFirst off: I am not sure wheter this problem has been solved by now but during my research I found many similar posts across google saying ""wrong password on ether wallet""\n\nI have created my Ether Wallet with geth back in August 2017.\nWhen I was asked to enter a password I created one with my trusty Keepass password manager which I use for years now and never had any problems.\n\nI pasted the password in the geth prompt twice and started mining.\n\nToday, I was trying to make my first transaction ever from the funds I had placed into the wallet. \nTo my surprise I saw the message: ""Wrong password"" when I confirmed the transaction.\n\nPanic ensued immediately.\n\nMy keepass creates very strong and cryptic passwords and this is the reason why I use it: I don't have to remember them. Only a single master password paired with a hardware-dongle. (USB stick, etc)\n\nWhen I setup my account back in August 2017 Keepass offered me a 80 character password with a lot of unicode characters.\nThis was not acknowledged by the current version of geth I had updated in the meantime.\n\nAfter 2 hours in panic mode, afraid to have lost roughly 2000 €worth of Ether, all I had to do was to download the geth version from August 2017, install it and update my account to a new password without any unicode characters.\n\nI used (windows) the command:\n\ngeth update account 0\n\n\nwas asked for the password I had stored in my keepass files and it worked. I could update my password and replace the original keystore file. Now I was able to send my ether.\n\n\nApparently, the ether wallet Mist and geth itself need some serious usability updates to minimize losses due to human error.\n\nEvery other wallet (ARK, NEM, Stellar, Ripple, etc) want's to have the password on every start.\nThis would have prevented - if my password was wrong - a human error on my side and saved me from dumping money into a wallet I can't use.\n\n\nA light wallet is needed as well.\nI am not the most experienced person when it comes to programming, scripting and handling command line tools but dealing with the never ending syncing problems in order to send ether would cause my to lose temper, if I was a new adopter without any knowledge...\n\nFacing such a situation with even less knowledge would be terrifying.
