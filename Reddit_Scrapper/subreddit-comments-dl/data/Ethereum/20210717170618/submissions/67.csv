7fv78q,1511789780,PoA to PoW transactions?,"Hi all, \n\nI'm getting to grips with how the ethereum blockchain works. i was wondering whether it is possible to have a private network talk to a public one. \n\nMy idea is that I want to set up a PoA chain where the stakeholders are known and pre-approved, these will be able to ""store"" smart property on the PoA, however the main transaction where money goes from one address to another is carried out on the main POW blockchain and linked to the private chain.

7fvc9g,1511791220,Single point of failure: Vitalik,"I’d like to start a conversation about how dependent is Ethereum on Vitalik (u/vbuterin). Those who’ve been around for a while know that Ethereum is much more than him. The EF is staffed with great developers, and VB doesn’t actually do any production development. He works on research, mainly re hybrid Casper and scalability. Also Ethereum ecosystem is very rich and expanding everyday, with individuals, new projects &amp; companies.\n\nYet, there is an ideological &amp; agenda-setting dependency on Vitalik, and public perception focuses extremely on his person, increased by the fact that he’s really active with many projects, lots of traveling and projects (a good thing overall!). If for whatever reason Vitalik would suddenly stop or reduce his involvement in Ethereum, I think it’s safe to expect a temporary stalling in progress (due to confusion and lack of direction) and a sharp fall in value of the network - in market terms (ETH price), effective use and public perception.\n\nThis is for me the single point of failure of Ethereum. Decentralization means that points of failure are reduced by reducing centers of authority/influence and its distribution through the network + reduction of barriers to access. BTC solved this problem long time ago: disappearance of Satoshi. We cannot and we don’t desire the same for Vitalik, therefore we’d need actions to reduce his influence and for redistribution of his power, without affecting the extremely high value he provides to Ethereum.\n\nWhat do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7fvc9g/single_point_of_failure_vitalik/,158,157
