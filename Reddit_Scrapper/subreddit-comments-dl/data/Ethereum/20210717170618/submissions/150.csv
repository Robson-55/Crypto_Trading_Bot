7ktq3o,1513695277,WARNING: Avoid Kraken at all costs (and a note on txn fee setting),"As a long time user of Kraken, I am sad to say this is the last straw. During this glorious Ether price rise, I have been swindled out of profits approximately 10 times by not being able to push orders through. I put up with it. But now, when trying to fund my account, after the funds have been confirmed deposited into my wallet, I am still denied access to use them through Kraken. They just haven't shown up. \n\nThis website is negligent, and I suspect that if they are rightfully sued for defrauding their customer base, that your funds will *conveniently disappear*. It's highly doubtful that they are even using software - I think a team of interns could outcompete their programmatic processing of transactions at this point.\n\nPPS: the ethereum network is highly congested - set your fees above the suggested amount to avoid the headache of waiting for confirmation for hours. \n\ntl;dr: Kraken will steal your money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ktq3o/warning_avoid_kraken_at_all_costs_and_a_note_on/,10,12

7ktsug,1513696028,PSA: Don't trust your printer,Just in a recent discussion I figured out some people might print keys with PRINTERS. They are know to have weak security! Also some save documents for a while. Please do not trust a printer - especially not with important private keys!\n\nTo generate a paper-wallet it is imho best to generate seed words with some offline computing device and then write them down with a pen - or etch them or whatever - but please think twice before using a printer for this job..,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ktsug/psa_dont_trust_your_printer/,254,129
