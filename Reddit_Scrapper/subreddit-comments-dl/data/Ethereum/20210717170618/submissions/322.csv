So maybe the guy will send the book back because he payed too much calculated in ETH.

The project's creators control/run most or all the nodes.\n\n-Many projects have horrible and hard to use wallets.\n\n-Many projects have a long (1-2 year) timeline into the future, where they promise many new features. Yet, their current offerings have few features.\n\nCan some early ethereum veterans tell me how things were back in 2014? Was it like I described?\n\nCheers",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7vulv4/ethereums_early_days_bootstrapping/,7,6
