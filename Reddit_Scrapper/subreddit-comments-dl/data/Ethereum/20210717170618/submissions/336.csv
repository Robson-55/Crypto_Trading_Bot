Obviously MyEtherWallet works fine currently, but should anything else happen, there isn't really a good alternative for end users without trying to download chain data, and from what I can tell, running a full node isn't really that helpful unless you're a miner/staker.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wvq63/should_the_efmist_team_create_a_natively_light/,2,2

Unfortunately, I do not have very good web design skills nor am I a programmer. That is where you come in. I would much prefer to work with someone who is equally invested as me, but if you are just looking for a side project, that works too.

Help us shape this effort by getting involved on the [ethereum/governance Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/governance) and attending our workshop at EthCC.*\n* *This proposal is written up in a Google Doc located at [https://goo.gl/DrJRJV](https://goo.gl/DrJRJV).*\n\n*And now for the proposal:*\n\n‚ú®\n\n**Towards a Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians**\n\n""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""\n‚Äî Arthur C.

We are a Fellowship of individuals rather than organizations, companies, governments or interest groups.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Technical Responsibility.**  The Fellowship accepts responsibility for all aspects of the Ethereum protocol specification.  The Fellowship may take responsibility for related specifications proposed to it in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Technical Competence.**  The Fellowship seeks consensus on proposals where we have the necessary competence.  The Fellowship is willing to listen to technically competent input from any source.\n&gt; \n&gt; **""Rough Consensus and Running Code.""**  Consensus is not unanimity or majority vote.  Rather, it is based on the combined technical judgement of our participants and our real-world experience in implementing and deploying our specifications.\n\n**Fellowship Practices**\n\n&gt; **Online Presence**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Curated web pages, including information about the Fellowship, a calendar of upcoming events, and links to useful resources.\n&gt; * Accessible discussion forums, with at least a threaded web interface and email integration.\n\n&gt; **In-Person Work**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Triannual meetings, two coordinated with Devcon and EthCC and one in July.\n&gt; * Meetups, discussions, presentations, workshops, hackathons, and other relevant activities.  These can organized by participants on an ad-hoc basis or with the sponsorship of the Fellowship.\n\n&gt; **Iterative Workflow**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Participants do research, gain experience, present their work, and make proposals.\n&gt; * Proposals are discussed and reworked, online and in person, until consensus is reached.\n\n‚ú®\n\n*Call to action: please contribute to the Google Doc located at [https://goo.gl/DrJRJV](https://goo.gl/DrJRJV).
