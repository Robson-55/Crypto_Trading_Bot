7ltje9,1514093557,Idea on combining bitcoin and ethereum via contract and sidechain,"I think would be super neat is if it was possible to make a sort of bridge between Ethereum and Bitcoin. I've yet to develop any smart contracts so take this idea with a grain of salt / not sure if it's possible but seems like it could be.\n\nIf there was an eth contract that kept updated with Bitcoin block headers you could have contracts which called into it and could tie transactions to blocks and future block heights. This could be done by allowing multiple competing chain and realigning the forks after so many blocks.\n\nOn Bitcoin side there could be some colored coin or sidechain which allowed linking to the above listed subcontract. If a sidechain could follow different rules ie would watch Ethereum subcontract and when it was fulfilled could finish the Bitcoin transaction (this I know absolutely 0 on, not sure if possible). This could enable using Bitcoin as the medium of exchange while keeping $ transferred in Bitcoin (minus the fees required to use Ethereum gas).\n\nWhy not just use Ethereum for this and sidestep Bitcoin completely? If we assume Bitcoin Cash will continue to have cheaper transaction fees than Ethereum (which I think is fair to assume, at least for this thought experiment) you could have very many transactions completed on Bitcoin when the contract was fulfilled, allowing for lower fees overall for the end users. \n\n---\n\nCurious on what you think of this idea. If it is completely unfeasible then... we should find out how to make it happen! The way I see Ethereum is that it is the king of smart contracts-- but this flexibility has a price. I see Bitcoin cash as the king of cheap dumb transactions-- but it is quite limited in its ability. If we could better unify them I think it'd be a force multiplier!

7ltkv9,1514094168,Can anyone convince me of some issues/sketpicism I found regarding Ethereum?,"I found the following post from a user:\n\nSome Ethereum Notes: (By no means complete.)\n-There is no firm ‚Äúupper cap‚Äù on Ethereum issuance, the schedule is 99 Million by 2025, 101 Million by 2128, and 104 Million by 5189.\n\n\n-Storage requirements for the barely 2-year crypto-currency will approach 1,024 GB inside a year. (By comparison, Bitcoin is 8.5 years old and uses 126 GB).\n\n\n-Ethereum mining supply is a huge overhang on the market. 26,205 ETH was mined in the last 24 hours compared to 1,838 BTC. This is approximately 14 times the rate, which must be absorbed by the Ethereum market every DAY to just maintain their current price.\n\n\n-Of the total ~92.4 Million ether in existence, 60 Million were pre-mined for the ‚Äúpresale‚Äù and another 12 Million are controlled by the select centralized group doing development. That represents 77% sitting in very few hands compared to the outstanding float.\n\n\n-For those reasons and more, including lack of technical competence, Ethereum has a lot of obstacles to overcome before they can start gloating about taking away Bitcoin‚Äôs market share.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ltkv9/can_anyone_convince_me_of_some_issuessketpicism_i/,23,13
