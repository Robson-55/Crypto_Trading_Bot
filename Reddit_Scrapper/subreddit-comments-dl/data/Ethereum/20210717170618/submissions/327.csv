Now when I will transfer his cryptos to him, I would like to keep the amount of my personal holdings as my private information. Is there any convenient way to send ETH or ERC20 tokens to another address and preserving anonymity? I could create another address and transfer through that, but when opening etherscan it can be easily seen what has happened. Another possibility that came to my mind would be to transfer them through an exchange, but then the transaction would be deducted by unnecessary transaction fees.\n\nAre there any easier ways to do this or other ideas?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7w6ccz/most_convenient_way_to_hide_senders_account/,2,7

I have a mashup of different questions here which I hope r/ethereum is able to answer.\n\n(1) Am I able to send ETH today without revealing the amount, sender or receiver on the public blockchain?\n\n(2) If I *am* able to do that, is this done by wrapping the ETH in a contract? What fee should I expect?\n\n(3) Am I able to pay the gas anonymously as well?\n\n(4) If I'm not able to do that today, will I be able to do so in the future?\n\n(5) When is it likely to happen?\n\nAnd a more general, speculative one in the end:\nWill ETH ever be the most popular coin for privacy purposes?

Also note, I'm not really interested on why or why not Stellar can do something, mostly wanting info on the Ethereum network.\n\n1. McCaleb brought up the point that in a hard fork, ERC-20 tokens would be duplicated. From the short research I did on this, it seems as though the tokens would have to choose which chain to honor. How much truth is there to this and is it a major disadvantage?\n\n2. Stellar is using  a delegated proof of stake like consensus model. Would a simple comparison of their model versus Ethereum's upcoming PoS model be that Stellar does not need all nodes to agree for a block to make it to the main chain whereas Ethereum's network requires all nodes to agree for a block to make it on the main chain?\n\nAny insight into either of these topics is greatly appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7w6vet/kevin_roses_block_zero_podcast_ep_w_stellar/,3,11
