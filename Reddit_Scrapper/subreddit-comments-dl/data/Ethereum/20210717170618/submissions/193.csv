It could be like an open decentralised bazaar, where people come to buy and sell any ERC721 token.

7nlvu3,1514892275,looking for suggestions on how to avoid running an ICO while developing a project,"Dear Ethereum redditors, I am looking for suggestions and feedback on how to get our tokens distributed without running an ICO, especially a big one. I am posting on r/ethereum since I am making a case against ICOs the way they are being used right now.\n\nThe whole idea behind Ethereum is the democratization of finance, including crowdsales, and our project aims at democratizing the organization and management of pools of tokens. Such need will become an urgent with the growth of Ethereum-based tokens, probably during the course of 2018 already.\n\nI will avoid naming our project's name, as some of you already know me and I would like to just have a discussion about a good strategy to fund projects and allow the distribution of tokens of a blockchain project.\n\nOur platform is built on a solidity smart contracts protocol and all of our operations are run through smart contracts. As a blockchain project, we leverage the Ethereum blockchain and build software on top of it. Hence our costs are mostly our work (we are a team of 3: 2 on software and 1 on PR).\n\nBy design, the platform costs at least 90% less than traditional centralized architectures to run, hence our burn rate is extremely low.\n\nWe have self-funded the project so far and find ourselves in a position where our protocol is almost ready for launch, our first product has been tested for months, and our redisigned platform is also almost ready. We are not even sure we could scale as quickly in terms of talent acquisition (there is a shortfall of blockchain talent atm).\n\nNotwithstanding not being listed on any exchange we have an amount of traffic on our website which is not significantly lower than a comparable listed project's.\n\nWe do not see the point of raising huge amounts of funds right now, and we would like to increase the engagement of our community. Our goal is that people buy our tokens because they want to use our products, and not to just speculate on making a quick profit after the listing.\n\nThrough an algorithm which we call proof-of-performance, our tokens are distributed to contributors to our protocol. As you might realize, ours is an inflation token, by design similar to Ether but the mining/minting process is similar in concept, but different in practice.\n\nWe are aware that getting investments is an important part of each business, however we would like to delay this part for the time we have validated our business idea on the mainnet and can actually use those funds to grow the team and promote our project commercially.\n\nWe think that the distribution of the tokens is a fundamental part of a network/protocol and, thanks to the proof-of-performance, we know that, over time, the token will be held by contributors to the network.\n\nWe are planning to pre-mint some tokens, sell a small part of those to parties who are interested in helping us grow the project, use some of the tokens as an incentive for developers, and then retain the rest for phase2 of the project. Contributors to our network/protocol will be able to gain tokens for free by using the protocol and, at a delayed stage, take part to a sale since they will need our tokens to use the platform.\n\nSince we are very close to releasing our protocol on the Ethereum mainnet and are creating our token coincidentally, we would like to get your feeback on whether this is a suitable way of getting funded and distributing our token.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7nlvu3/looking_for_suggestions_on_how_to_avoid_running/,6,8
7nlwwn,1514892719,Why are Casper contracts written in Viper?,"We're seeing a first generation of smart contracts on Ethereum along with a first generation of fun exploits.

7nm19e,1514894509,Need a little help/advice using Parity,"I am currently using Parity for Windows v1.7.10-stable and have it fully synced. I downloaded the wallet about 6 days ago so that I could receive some free ARTIS coins. I can see that the coins have been [sent to my wallet on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00478b85ed514f2090ad8d661701d2fb19419d5a#tokentxns), so I know that there is no issue there. However, I have never been able to see any coins on my wallet.\n\nI have spoken to the devs multiple times on Telegram and they have tried to be as helpful as possible and have sent more coins, (total now 10k ARTIS) but they still fail to show up in my Parity wallet?\n\nIs there something that I am supposed to do to see these coins?\n\nSo far I have gone to the Contracts section&gt;Watch and inputted the [details for the contract address](https://etherscan.io/token/0x082e13494f12ebb7206fbf67e22a6e1975a1a669) that shows on Etherscan for their token. Given it a name and hit Enter as usual. I can see the address that I am watching in my wallet, but nothing has shown up since I did this last week. [Screenshot here](https://imgur.com/a/J3uvB).\n\nAlso, there is nothing in my main ETH address. [Screenshot here](https://imgur.com/a/3lrVk). Note that I don't actually have any eth on this wallet as it is meant for ERC20 tokens at this point. I have no idea waht PNS coin is even though it appears in both wallets so I assume that it is something that is spammed to all eth addresses.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas as to why these token are not showing up? Is there something I am supposed to activate?\n\nAny help gratefully appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7nm19e/need_a_little_helpadvice_using_parity/,7,6
