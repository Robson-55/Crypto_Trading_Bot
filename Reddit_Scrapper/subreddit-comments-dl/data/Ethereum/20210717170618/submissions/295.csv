7tusrv,1517253942,Introducing Ibis - An Ethereum-based token to revolutionize the nonprofit sector,"For the past several months, my friends and I have been working to develop [Ibis](https://www.tokenibis.com/). Like alice.si, giveth.io and others, Ibis is intended to improve the nonprofit sector. It‚Äôs simply a currency that can only be used for transparent and standardized charitable giving, which has the potential to enable all kinds of new transactions in our economy.\n\nImportantly, there will never be an Ibis ICO, and the value will be pegged to Ether. Equally as important, we will never take an operational cut on transactions. 100% of donations through Ibis will go to charity. We built the project on volunteer hours and wish to keep it as simple and low-maintenance as possible.\n\nThere is still a lot to do to get Ibis off the ground, and we aren't going to be able to do it all ourselves. Please check out this [introductory post](https://www.tokenibis.com/introduction-ibis/), or better yet, read our [whitepaper](https://www.tokenibis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/white_paper-1.pdf). If you'd like to get involved, reach out to us through the contact form on our website or through any of our social media accounts (linked on the website). We'd be happy to have you! Oh and subscribe to our subreddit r/tokenibis. We just launched it and would be like to start building a reddit community!\n\nAny feedback you can give us is appreciated! We really want to make this project a success. \n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7tusrv/introducing_ibis_an_ethereumbased_token_to/,9,8

7tw2f9,1517264110,Ethereum Games.,"Good morning Ethereans,    \nIs there a list of Ethereum games someone could link me to? If not, perhaps people could name them in this thread and I will collate and edit the thread to include a list. Evidence indicating a game/collectible is a scam or has security issues would be nice too, but as we still live in experimental times, it goes without saying that security is a concern for now.    \n\nThe eth games space intrigues me. There are eth casino games which are likely to be popular. There are collectibles. Are there other categories I am missing? Are ""collectibles"" better thought of in a different way? For example, are eth collectibles better described by several categories?    \n\nThanks :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7tw2f9/ethereum_games/,2,29
