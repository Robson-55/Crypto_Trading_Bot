7rb4wx,1516295147,incoming transaction from unknown sender!?,"Hey folks,\n\ndid anyone notice an ""unknown"" ETH transfer to their wallets two days ago? I received some mEth from a sender and I have no idea who or what it was. Over 1000 lucky people? I doubt it. \nIf you follow the one incoming 7500 eth transaction further back (show all, last page), you find transactions from all kinds of exchanges, e.g. Binance, Bittrex, Yobit, Kranken and probably more.\nIt was no ICO refund I guess, got all my tokens. Checked the exchanges i use, no withdrawals in that timeframe.\n\nI do not complain, I am just curious who did send 7500 eth to over 1000 addresses and why :)\n\nHere is the sender's address in question:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x9ba3dfcad257ccfed150ae2d9b71c0daea0e97cd\n\nHappy hunting!\n\nEDIT: It looks like it indeed was an ICO refund, InsurePal to be exact. After double checking all numbers I roughly received only 57% + presale bonus, each eth-receiving account also holds IPL. Maybe they did run out of tokens?! Crowdsale was done in 80 seconds. But I did not catch any announcement regarding a refund. \n\nThanks everyone for the ideas!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7rb4wx/incoming_transaction_from_unknown_sender/,24,37
