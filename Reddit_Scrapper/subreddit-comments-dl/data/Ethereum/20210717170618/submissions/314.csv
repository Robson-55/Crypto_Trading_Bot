7v7n2p,1517761419,Who Else Wants to Team Up and Build Cool Stuff?,"The growing movement of collaboration in this new blockchain economy has me amazed.\n\nNever before has it been so easy for anyone to, without permission, take a financial stake in a project they believe in, and then do what they can to move it forward.\n\nSure, speculation is rampant, but if just a small fraction of speculators get involved with one or more projects, when they otherwise would not have, I see it as a win. \n\nNever before has an open source project been able to gain continual momentum via network effects, which enable them to easily fund bounties.\n\nI want to start a research project building DApps as vehicles to solve blockchain problems. Those problems will then be broken out into libraries. And hopefully those libraries will gain momentum and end up contributing, even just a little, to the ecosystem.\n\nWho is with me?\n\nI will handle all initial organization to make sure this project runs smoothly, but ultimately the entire team will be self-governing.\n\nHelps if you have one or more of the following skills:\n\n- Javascript (ES6+)\n- React + React Native + Redux\n- UI / UX Design\n\nThose will be the main building blocks, everything else (Ethereum APIs, unit testing, iOS/Android native wrappers, etc) you can learn as we go. \n\nI want our projects to be as as accessible as possible so we can draw in more and more developers. I believe focusing on React + modern JS is the best way to achieve this. JS can be messy, but we can use tooling to enforce high quality code standards. I want to avoid any unnecessary barriers to participation.\n\nAbout me:\n\n- Age: early 30s\n- Programming complex web applications since 2002 (expert PHP proficiency)\n- Career has been in digital marketing and data analysis\n- Experienced in hiring and managing remote teams \n\nI will share my Facebook / LinkedIn over direct message with anyone who is serious. \n\nIf you’re interested, let’s here why. \n\nPlease respond here and/or upvote to help us gain more exposure.\n\n[[P.S.
