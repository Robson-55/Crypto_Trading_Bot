Us Miners are essentially providing a service, Selling our Hashes for exchange for ETH.  But who is actually needing our Hashes, are they paying for it? \n\n&gt;With ETH eventually going to POS,   If it lost over 50% of it hashing power because  of POS and miners move their hashing power to another coin.  Does the ETH Network need our hashing power to be functional or just will it be working at a lesser capacity. \n\n\n\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7xdcom/discussion_what_is_the_best_example_of_using/,1,8

7xezdh,1518577010,Philosophical Underpinnings.,"Lately I'm getting increasingly focused on the trajectories of where different enterprises draw their inspiration from, the kind of culture they nurture and thus the sort of things they tend to pull within the orbits of their entelechy (ah, I love ancient greek refs).\n\nI think this is not unimportant at all, and along these lines I am increasingly beginning to notice Ethereum as embodying Friedrich Hayek's vision of a decentralized economic order (most strikingly obvious with projects like Augur, i.e. the concept of prediction markets is first elaborated upon in Hayek's 1945 essay ""The Use of Knowledge in Society""... it's a pity that from all his work he is above all known for the shittiest one, ""The Road to Serfdom"", and unjustly appropriated by the free market fundamentalists of the Chicago school type).\n\nFurthermore, and especially when also considering things like IOTA, I find it all particularly reminiscent of a contemporary school of thought which emerged almost alongside from a trend that became known as Speculative Realism -- namely, Object-Oriented Ontology (which is itself an extension, in a way, of Latour's Actor-Network Theory).\n\nLatour's ANT as such is a descriptive material-semiotic approach to the social sciences (Latour himself says that ""Actant-Rhizome"" might be a better suited term, but in order to not become too obscurantist and keep it simple he stuck to simplified terminology which I can only respect), where things — whether human, non-human, semantic, symbolic, conceptual, etc. — exist on an equal ontological footing, none more real than another, for as long as they exercise an effect.\n\nSimilarly, OOO rejects the privileging of human existence over that of nonhuman objects, and also attributes agency to nonhuman actors (in contrast to the anthropocentric view of Kant's Copernican Revolution where phenomenal objects are said to conform to the mind of the subject). For an OO ontologist (ontology and metaphysics can be used interchangably and synonymously) all relations, including those between objects and nonhumans, distort their related objects in the same way as human consciousness does for itself and exist on a 'flat surface', or what Levi Bryant has termed ""the demoracy of objects"" (also summed up by Richard Brown in his famous phrase: ""On the blockchain nobody knows you're a fridge."")\n\nWhen we also put AI into the mix while considering Giambattista Vico's Universal History, or the three-fold cyclical process through which man goes through, it really puts a lot into perspective (for me anyway).\n\nICON (ICX), for whoever has looked at the white paper (the English speaking 'community' on the subreddits here is mostly douchebags, moonboys and people who downvote any legitimate question in bandwagoning hordes, and there doesn't actually seem to be any ICON representitives around, +most of the relevant documentation appears to be still in Korean), begins with the following quote from Deleuze &amp; Guattari's ""A Thousand Plateaus"":\n\n&gt;""A rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo. The tree is filiation, but the rhizome is alliance, uniquely alliance. The tree imposes the verb ""to be"" but the fabric of the rhizome is the conjunction, ""and ... and ...and...""This conjunction carries enough force to shake and uproot the verb ""to be."" Where are you going? Where are you coming from? What are you heading for? These are totally useless questions.""\n\nFurther down the paper:\n\n&gt;ICON is inspired by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s rhizome – “the world with no center point and the world where any point is a mere connection to other points.” ICON is a connector of disparate cryptocurrencies with different blockchain governances, and furthermore, a connector of the crypto world to our real world. ICON embraces the new and the unfamiliar, the principle of radical inclusion – accept new ideas and decisions made by the new republic established by ever-changing crypto-to-real world connections.\n\nAnyway, thought I'd share these things with you guys, hopefully presenting interest and points of further discussion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7xezdh/philosophical_underpinnings/,12,5
