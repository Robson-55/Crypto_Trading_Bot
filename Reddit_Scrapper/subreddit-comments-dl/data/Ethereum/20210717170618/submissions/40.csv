I sort of take it for granted, so when my public accounting firm asked me to put something into words, I figured I would ask this sub. \n\nAlso, wondering how to describe how we can be sure that a full node (which would be the source of info for the block explorer) is complete and accurate.

7dd54n,1510846516,Long sync times with geth,"I know it's been asked and talked about a few times, but was curious if there is any other newer solutions (most i read the total blocks were in the 2M range and it's at 4M now)\n\nI have Ethereum wallet that syncs with geth - but i don't run it all the time (sometimes it'll be off for a few weeks) - so when i open it i need to sync say 200,000 blocks.  If i let it run, it does about 50,000 a day so it takes 4-5 days to sync and then needs to sync the new ones for those 4-5 days.\n\nI tried deleting the entire chaindata folder and did a --syncmode ""fast"" command but when it ""completed"" after 3-4 hours i now had 300k blocks to sync (up from the original 200k) which after 2 days has done about 80,000 of those.\n\nI tried setting --cache 1024 --maxpeers 100 --maxpendpeers 100 \n\nand it uses 5.3gb of memory and 30% cpu but still takes just as long to sync.  it's on an SSD and will use 100% of the disk during this time with a write speed varying from 14 - 38 MB/s with a read speed between 20-45 MB/sec all this for about 1 block/sec or so.
