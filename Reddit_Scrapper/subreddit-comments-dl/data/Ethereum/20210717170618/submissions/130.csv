What sort of infrastructure might be necessary to execute a cross-platform compatible DApp?

7jnvsv,1513211624,Friend's presale wallet is empty. Any thoughts?,"He received, and still has, the email with the JSON that conspicuously said ""Your are **about** to purchase Ether"" He thinks that it's possible that the BTC was never sent because he said he may have sent it from one of the shadier exchanges that doesn't exist anymore (possibly Coinedup?). He has almost no recollection of the process. He checked the JSON with the wallet it came with, and with MEW and both say his balance is 0. Is all hope lost? Is there a process that can still be completed to receive it? Any help would be appreciated. The reason I'm doing this for him is due to fear of getting hacked. Thanks!

7jp7kt,1513225411,Built my first rig - 5 AMD RX580's all getting 30.5 MH/s,"For operation details, temps etc: https://snag.gy/6KatuI.jpg\n\nHere's what's in it\n\n1) Rosewill 8 GPU mining case  ( I found it to be much easier to put 5 in there, and soon a 6th, but 8 will fit if you have the right power supply.  I have a 1600W PSU and while it has enough juice there's simply not enough ports to to give individual PCIe connectors to all cards, so 6 will have to do.\n\n2) Using Ethos on an SSD plugged in via USB... Ethos has great support for these cards\n\n3) 8 GB of RAM, and a cheap Celeron processor\n\n4) ASUS Motherboard with latest BIOS, no flash required, and set to Gen 3 for PCIe slots\n\n5) In the front of the case I have 3 fans, each about 200 CFM... This brought the temps down on the cards almost an addition 15*  matter of fact the CFM from these three fans is more than the 7 fans I had before (3 in front, 4 80mm in the back).  They're louder, but this rig sits in my 20 rack data center with loud inrow coolers, so you don't even notice the noise.\n\n6) Had to use ATI Flash to backup the BIOS on each card, and then in virtual box on my machine I used the latest version of Polaris editor to edit the BIOS.  The ONLY change I made was to copy the straps up to 2250 on this card.  It was already OC'ed to 1450 from purchase.\n\n7) In screen shot link above you can see the mem, core, temps etc along with hashrates.\n\n\n** Notes **\nYes I can get more out of these cards, like .5 MH/s more but I found that to be too unstable and I didn't want to lose a night of hashing here and there because in the middle of the night a GPU crashed or the entire thing locked up.\n\nI am using Claymore, and while others say it's faster, I didn't get better results than ethminer.  I am using DwarfPool as well.   I spend 4 days trying a bunch of software, drivers, combination of settings, you name it.
