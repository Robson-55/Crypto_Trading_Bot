7ivfpc,1512928859,CryptoKeeper - new iOS/Android app for monitoring your exchange/eth/btc/xrp wallet balances. I'm looking for iOS beta testers.,"Hello!\n\nFirst off - [demo video here](https://vimeo.com/246526941)\n&amp;nbsp;  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n&gt;So, how is this different from all the other coin tracking apps?\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \nWell - it links directly to your exchange accounts/wallets, and will update your balances in real time. No more manual adding of coins!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The app currently supports these exchanges:**\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nBittrex  \nCoinbase  \nKraken (when their API isn't falling over ;))  \nBitfinex  \nLiqui  \nHitBTC  \nPoloniex  \nBinance  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**AND these blockchain wallets:**\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nETH + ERC20 tokens  \nBTC  \nXRP\n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou can add as many of each of these as you want, and name them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Other features:**\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nCaching of results, so if an api is down (i'm looking at you kraken), the app will use the most recent data it got.  \n\nView your totals in 50+ local currencies, including GBP, EUR and USD.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Features the app doesn't have:**  \n\nAbility to add trades, prices you bought at, and all that other stuff that serious traders want.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Privacy**\n\nAll data is stored on your device, and never sent to us. The app talks directly to either the exchange API's or some kind of interface with the relevant blockchain.\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n**Sounds good, how can i help?**\n\nWell, if you're on iOS i'm running a beta test *right now*. DM me your iTunes email address and i'll add you to the beta.

I've read many different ways people hold their keys, but most of the techniques are protecting against losing them or getting them stolen, not protecting them with the intent to pass them on to other people at the right time. My assumption is that whomever is executing my estate will not be familiar with pass phrases, seeds, truecrypt, etc, so the methods I'm familiar with and comfortable with will most likely fail when it's time to pass things on.\nAnother barrier I've thought of is how to enable access to online accounts, such as exchanges, which require 2 factor authentication. How would my estate gain access to these sites if I'm dead, and my phone is destroyed or can't be accessed because it is locked by its own security? I'm not aware of the ability of Google Authenticator or Authy to allow access from another device by a password, so it's not like I could just add those to the master accounts and password list.\nThoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ivp6y/how_are_you_managing_your_crypto_assets_if_you_die/,14,11

Everything was fine when I first installed it (it's Mist), the chain downloaded fairly quickly (overnight) and the next day it was ready.\n\nNow it's been about a few thousand blocks behind the main net for the past two days. It looks like it's pretty much getting new blocks at the pace at which the network is mining them, so it's just not catching up.\n\nNothing has changed in my setup. I have fast internets (120mbps down), the node is the only ""hungry"" application on a Windows 2012 R2 box with an i5-2500/16GB RAM, and the chain is sitting by itself on a WD RED mechanical HDD that is not used for anything else at the moment.\n\nWhat could be causing this?
