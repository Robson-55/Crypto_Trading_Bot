7n1qmt,1514643358,Are Dapps like Cryptokitties or EtherTanks that produce lots of transactions good or bad for the network?,"When Cryptokitties first came out it filled up the network with loads of transactions. Now it seems like ethertanks is kicking off and as far as I can tell a similar thing is happening. Obvious neither of these Dapps offer any real value besides a bit of fun and gambling (and that guy that made tons of cash on trading kitties) but is the increase in transactions good for the network? If these Dapps don't attract any new people to use ETH does the increase in mining fees that all the transactions are paying lead to the network running better or increase the value of ETH at all?\n\nSorry if terribly worded, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the technical details of how the network works.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7n1qmt/are_dapps_like_cryptokitties_or_ethertanks_that/,45,50
