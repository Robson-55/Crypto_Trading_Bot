7upzlw,1517560401,(zkSNARKs) How will we know that the right number of tokens still exist in circulation once we're able to transact privately on Ethereum? Does this apply to tokens as well?,"This zkSNARKs is boggling my mind...\n\nIf transactions become private (I'm guessing this means that you won't be able to tell from which address you received the Eth from) and tracking it becomes impossible, how can we be sure that the correct number of tokens still exist in circulation? \n\nIf someone looked hard enough for an address that exchanged a very specific amount say .98072817 eth, couldn't you spot it? \n\nAlso slightly off topic but would znSNARKS on ethereum allow you to transact tokens privately as well??",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7upzlw/zksnarks_how_will_we_know_that_the_right_number/,20,2
