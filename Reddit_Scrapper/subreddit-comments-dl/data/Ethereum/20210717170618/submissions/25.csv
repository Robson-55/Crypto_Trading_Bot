7c0z7p,1510319349,Tokens aren't securities and shouldn't be treated as such,"An interesting legal issue that arose with regard to ICOs is whether the relevant tokens should be considered as securities.\n\nI think this is clearly a case where government is trying to squeeze reality into a Procrustean bed for its convenience in a particularly stupid way. \n\nFirst, most of the tokens in no way resemble either stocks or bonds. They are, rather, currencies that are fulfilling certain roles within app protocols. If you don't think an online game's currency is a security, you should also recognize the absurdity of the idea of treating most tokens as such.\n\nSecondly, even where tokens somewhat resemble security, the obvious problem is that the projects being developed are open-source. Meaning that there are almost no assets to have a recourse to. Extending security protections to tokens will only serve to create in some people the illusion of safety, while raising the transaction costs for everyone.\n\nTokens may pass the Howey test, for instance, but it was arguably formulated for a reality in which protocol assets and open source didn't exist and couldn't even have been imagined. I hope this reasoning may be used should the Ethereum developers face security regulators in courts. In a precedent-based system, precedents aren't absolutely binding, and, say, courts may be persuaded to scrap the Howey test here.\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7c0z7p/tokens_arent_securities_and_shouldnt_be_treated/,0,9

7c2lhi,1510335341,Legal vulnerability in Ethereum?,"This topic has be brought up about a year ago, but I don’t think it has been taken seriously enough.\n\nI think there is a serious vulnerability in Ethereum (and most other blockchains) that allows an attacker to induce governments around the world to ban it.\n\nThe censorhip-resistant nature of the blockchain allows anyone to submit arbitrary transactions to the network and have the data submitted with these transactions to be forever persisted in the blockchain, being downloaded and redistributed by every single node in the network.\n\nThis means that, if someone uploads illegal data to the network (copyrighted material, child porn, terrorist propaganda, hate speech etc) the whole network will start replicating it, thus making every node become a possible target for prosecution by governments around the world. (for an example of uploading arbitrary data to the chain see https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/1106/is-there-a-limit-for-transaction-size)\n\nFor example, a transaction in Ethereum can contain arbitrary data. Uploading a 40KB jpeg within a transaction would currently cost only a few USD. Flooding Ethereum with thousands of illegal images infringing a range of laws in most countries would take only a few thousands of dollars.\n\nEven if ultimately no government prosecutes participants, the mere risk of it happening could be enough to significantly depress the value of the currency, possibly benefiting an attacker who has shorted it.\n\nMy intent with this post is not FUD, nor am I bashing Ethereum. I’m an enthusiast, I develop for the platform and I firmly believe that Ethereum will keep evolving until it truly delivers on all of its promises. I am also not a lawyer and maybe all the above is completely wrong.\n\nI’d love to be proven wrong.\n\nIf I’m not completely wrong about this, though, I think it is worth thinking of possible technical, legal or legislative workarounds for this issue.\n\nMaybe light clients could be used to minimize risks for most users?\n\nI’d be specially interested in the opinion of any lawyers that might be reading this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7c2lhi/legal_vulnerability_in_ethereum/,3,72
