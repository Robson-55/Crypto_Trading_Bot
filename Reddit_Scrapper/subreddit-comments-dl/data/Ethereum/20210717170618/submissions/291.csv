7tm4ge,1517165161,Yesterday Bryan Armstrong (CEO of Coinbase) wrote a blog post about using cryptocurrency for charity. He described my project almost exactly. Last week I started the interview process at Coinbase. The recruiter and I discussed my project,"##**This is not an accusation**\n\nMy name is Alex. Last week I interviewed with Coinbase. For the past three months my friends and I have been donating work to a charity project designed to perpetually fund charitable organizations. \n\nI consider this amazing serendipity. I am very excited. So, I am asking for your help getting this to his attention. I have filled out the form in the blog post, emailed through earn.com, replied to the blogkmessaged /u/bdarmstrong and I emailed my recruiter directly. I believe in being thorough, below is a description of our project. \n\n##**This is not an accusation**\n\n**Original Post:** https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7teto5/brian_armstrong_coinbase_ceo_proposing_a/dtcvk21/\n\n**TLDR:** \n\nhttps://igave.io/whitepaper.pdf \n\nhttps://igave.io/demo\n\nhttps://github.com/I-Gave\n\n\n# I Gave - A Decentralized Autonomous Charitable Organization to perpetually fund Charity Operation Costs\n\nRaising donations for operations costs is the most challenging obstacle for charitable organizations. I Gave is a DAO for funding charity operation costs. All Ether raised in the ICO will go to donations that grow non-profit organizations. A monthly vote by IGV token holders will decide the recipients. \n\nThe I Gave DAPP is a smart contract for charitable fundraising. Fundraisers issue ERC-721 digital assets representing donation items. Tokenizing charitable donations creates a decentralized philanthropy market. \n\nA Metamask enabled embedded HTML snippet allows anyone to accept Ether donations on behalf of charity on their website.  Philanthropists purchase the ERC-721 tokens to make their donation. Web3 provides donor token holders new web experiences based on their donations.\n\n\n# Problem\n\n Large charities need funding to keep their organizations running. They must pay employees, raise funds, incur building costs, and marketing. Even then, donors must trust their money is well spent. These investments in themselves are often, wrongly, stigmatized. \n\n  **From 1970 to 2009 the number of nonprofits to cross the $50M revenue barrier is 1441.** The number of for-profit was 46,136. Why are nonprofits incapable of capturing market share?\n\n  Money is the symptom. Social dogma is the problem. It is taboo to profit from helping others. The things we are taught to think about giving and philanthropy and charity undermine the causes we love. We have no problem with someone making millions of dollars selling widgets but make half a million dollars curing sick kids and you risk character assassination. \n\n  Philanthropists prefer their gifts go to the needy. It’s a difficult problem explaining that marketing benefits the needy. A donation that grows an organization can help tens or hundreds more. \n\n  Risk is also heavily scrutinized. A Hollywood movie can cost millions and flop at the box office. If a charity CEO fails to deliver a return in a short period of time they may lose their career. Without the ability to take risks, entrepreneurs cannot generate innovation in the space.\n\n\n# Offer / Solutions\n\n##### Decentralized Philanthropy Market\nTokenizing charitable donations creates a new commodity. Philanthropists can shop for donations. \n\nWe've created an embedded donation button. Once a charity issues a token supply anyone in the world may add our script to their page, decorate HTML elements and begin accepting donations on behalf of charity. There are no middleman fees, the buttons interact directly with the smart contract. \n\nThis allows brands, shops, celebrities - anyone - to style the button to match their brand, to create their own lists and markets for giving. It is completely customizable with CSS.\n\n##### Monthly DAO Allowance\n\nThe ICO contract will place 100% of ICO funds in a voting contract controlled by token holders. Each month, the contract will unlock a portion of funds. Each token may direct the funds to a charity address on a whitelist. Charities will petition the DAO to be added to the list. The DAO will determine eligibility and criteria. Dev Funds will follow the recently proposed DAICO model.\n\n\n##### Ecosystem of DAPPs\n\nThe first I Gave DAPP supports creating charity campaigns, issuing tokens (tokenizing donations), automatic 501c tax certificates, a donation portfolio, and a tracking dashboard. 1% of all donations made on the DAPP are added to the Monthly DAO Allowance.\n\n\n##### ERC-721 Token Voting\n\nWe intend to give donors voting rights in the DAO. In time, as the number of donors increases, the ERC-721 donor token values will eclipse the original ICO token values. The flippening will occur and philanthropists who have given will eventually have more votes than the ICO token holders.\n\nThe philanthropists will inherit this project. At no time are ICO funds controlled by myself or anyone on the project. Everything is handled through smart contract. \n\n# Progress\n\n1. The DAPP is available to demo. https://igave.io/demo\n2. The embedded donation button is available to demo. https://igave.io/embedded/3/1\n3. We have a team of around five people. Most of the developers are former Bitpay employees.\n4. We've begun reaching to charitable organizations through our charity advisor to begin onboarding.\n\n# Who are you?\n\nThis is me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexsherbuck/\n\nI was working at Bitpay until the beginning of this month when I started doing this project full time. \n\n\n# Crypto-Philanthropist Manifesto\n\n  In less than ten years we've built ourselves a reputation as drug dealers, money launderers, terrorists, and scammers. Whether it’s true, or not.\n\n  This project means to challenge our community. The double standard set for non-profits incites the same feelings I felt getting into cryptocurreny in 2012. These organizations are our allies.\n\n  No one innovates in their space. It's very easy to empathize with organizations who are already pushed to the brink. They can't take the risk. We can.\n\n  But we have pushed ourselves to the point where people will take our money but are dubious to associate with us. \n\n  Solving the tech debt with scaling is not the end of our race. There are mountains of debt in reputation, brand, customer service and user experience. \n\n  We've created a bubble. Not with the price but with the direction we're all heading. When the market finally corrects we may not recover. This project is not a part of the crypto gold rush. If anything, we are going in the opposite direction.\n\n  This is a chance to show the power this technology has to affect change. **If we want to build the world we want to live in we have to prove that the tools we use can do it better than those that came before.**\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7tm4ge/yesterday_bryan_armstrong_ceo_of_coinbase_wrote_a/,1045,131

And then I pretty much forgot about it.\n\nNow I'd like to know if I have received those token, but I have no idea how to do it. I have seen some tutorials about how to fund ICOs and receive tokens, but I think that doesn't apply to me, or I just don't understand it.\n\nI'm still new to this technology and still learning. I would just like some help in finding out if I received any tokens.\n\nThanks.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks guys for suggesting Etherscan. I see over there that I have received the Playkey tokens. I'm just trying to figure out now how I can access those tokens, as in my Mist wallet I don't see them.\n\n**Edit2:** I just followed this tutorial https://steemit.com/mist/@diginet/how-to-watch-a-token-in-mist-wallet, to connect the token contract address to my mist wallet and now I'm just waiting for it to sync for my tokens to show up.
