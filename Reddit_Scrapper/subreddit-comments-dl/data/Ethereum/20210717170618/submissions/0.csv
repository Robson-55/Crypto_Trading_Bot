79wxp5,1509467631,Practical tips for DEVCON3 assistants if you have to deal with the police.,"I know you are all smart folks but this may be useful.\n\nTry to avoid renting a car.  use the bus, also they are always vans from the hotel to most of the touristic destinations. \n\nThese are some practical tips for you to deal with the police \nkeep in mind this will only work if you did or are accused of something minor like speeding, parking on a wrong spot, wrong turns, even driving midly intoxicated (Note that I am no recommending you to do this stuff) \n-Important notice- Never carry more than $100 usd on yourself. \n\n1.- Keep calm as much as possible. corrupt police are very good detecting fear and will use it against you. keep in mind they only want your money.\n\n2.- Even if this scumbags don't  deserve it, treat them with respect. refer to them as SeÃ±or oficial or officer.  Nothing triggers them more that make them feel not in control.\n\n3.- Make him know as soon as possible that you know you did something wrong but don't be cheeky or shameful about it try show some guilt. don't try to make up a good excuse. they have done this for years and they are good spotting bullshiters \n(They also want this to end as soon as possible so they can keep working on other targets)\n\n4.- The tricky part. After you admitted you will have to ask him "" Is there other way we can work this out?"" Now, he will bring up the bullshit that you can pay the fine in the spot that is not true. He will try to intimidate you saying that the fine is a really high amount. you have to keep your ground and tell him you only got $50 usd max $100 with you and that is all you got.\n\nNote that for speeding the actual fine ranges from $50 to $80 usd\nFor bad turns $20 - $35 \nDriving under the influence is punishable with jail time :/  (depends on the alcohol on your blood. but you don't want to get to this point)\n\nIf what you are ask'ed for is way higher than the fines it maybe preferable for you to pay the actual fine \n\nThis is where you have to keep your ground and make it clear that that is all the money you have. 95% the time they will take the money and leave.  sometimes they will even give you this kind of keyword you can use if you are stopped again... \n\nNow I feel kinda dirty for writing this but I hope it can save you guys some troubles\n\nAlso if you have other doubts you can PM anytime!  \n\nSource: I'm Mexican and was a stupid teenager.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/79wxp5/practical_tips_for_devcon3_assistants_if_you_have/,27,3
