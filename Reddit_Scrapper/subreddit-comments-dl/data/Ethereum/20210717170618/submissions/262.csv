7rerwo,1516325278,"EtherRockets.com : A fully functional decentralized Blockchain game with collectible rockets, competitions and a user marketplace","Hello!\n\n For the past few weeks, we’ve been working on an Ethereum Blockchain project with goal of exploring the possibilities of decentralized apps. With [EtherRockets.com](https://etherrockets.com), we had 3 goals in mind:\n\n\n- Understand the interactions and what’s possible with Blockchain technology\n- Create a decentralized application with assets that can be bought, sold and, most importantly, used for a purpose\n- Provide players with an incentive to participate in our game; Missions on our platform allow players to compete against each other for prize pools and upgrades to their assets\nUltimately, we wanted to create a full-feature ecosystem that — while maintaining room to grow — gives users a real opportunity to experience the direction that decentralized apps are moving towards.\n\n(Full post here https://medium.com/@etherrockets/etherrockets-com-26c514336263 , below is a summary)\n**With that said, EtherRockets 1.0 is now live with all of the following:**\n\n\n- **Rockets **— a collectible asset with unique stats that influence its performance in Missions (our global mini-games). Each rocket has a Tier, which determines which missions it can participate in, and a Grade, which indicate how close its stats are to the potential maximum.\n\n\n- **Store **— the Store is where initial rockets are obtained. Rockets purchased in the store will always remain the same fixed price; however, each rocket’s stats are rolled between ranges on purchase making each asset unique. Each rocket on the store has a limited supply, so make sure you get there fast!\n\n- **Marketplace** — the Marketplace is where players can sell their rockets to other players, allowing players to determine market price for rockets. Once stock of each rocket has depleted in the Store, the Marketplace will be the only source to buy those rockets.\n\n\n- **Missions** — Missions are global mini-games that allow players to compete against each other for Ether prizes and rocket upgrades. There is an entry fee associated with participating in a mission — however, the entry fee also fuels the prize pool that rewards the top players. The goal is to configure your rocket to land as close to the target destination as possible. The top 10 players for each mission receive winnings directly from the prize pool (#1 receives 50% of prize pool, #2 receives 25%, etc) which goes directly into your on-site balance. In addition you also receive an automatic stat boost to the rocket you used. More challenging missions are available to higher tier rockets as the stakes increase.\n\n\nWe hope you enjoy using EtherRockets, and if you have any feedback or ideas we'd love to hear them!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7rerwo/etherrocketscom_a_fully_functional_decentralized/,10,17
