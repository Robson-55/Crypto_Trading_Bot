So if there is an emergency and I need to access my funds quickly, what's the fastest way to go about it? Can I enter the 24 word seeds into the mnemonic phrase on myetherwallet?

7s9hke,1516659072,Ethertulips.com: Tulip mania. With battles. Now on the Ethereum blockchain.,"Hey guys!\n\nAs a lot of you might know, there’s recently been a lot of...*""interesting""* applications of the Ethereum blockchain lately (CryptoKitties, Etheremon, EtherTanks etc.), and lots of people have been calling crypto the biggest bubble since Tulip mania. Well, we’re a group of bored college students and decided to push the craze to the next level by putting virtual tulips on the Ethereum blockchain!\n\nRight now, we have an initial release where you can buy “Gen-0” tulips. Each time you buy a seed, you’ll get a random tulip from over 1000 possible ones with varying rarity. As of now, there isn’t really a general theme, but we have lots of zany ideas that we’ll be releasing soon. We'll be sure to give Gen-0 a buff compared to future generations! You can read more about Gen-0 and rarities [here](https://medium.com/@ethertulips/origins-generation-0-tulips-249a99b02203). \n\nAs for a more general roadmap, we’re working on getting trading out ASAP, and we can’t wait to release our flagship feature--tulip battles.\n\nYup! You heard that right--we’re going to be adding tulip battles, because no Ethereum dapp is complete without battling. *The possibilities with the Ethereum blockchain are endless!* \n\nIf you’re interested in playing, come on over to https://www.ethertulips.com/! And if you have any questions or whatnot, please don’t hesitate to email us at contact@ethertulips.com. You can also head on over to r/ethertulips to chat with us.\n\n**tl;dr** mit students on break got bored, we decided to make a dapp parodying recent ""games"" and the whole “cryptocurrency bubble” - hope you enjoy the fun and don't gamble your life savings on this :\^)\n\ncontract source code: https://etherscan.io/address/0x995020804986274763df9deb0296b754f2659ca1#code",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7s9hke/ethertulipscom_tulip_mania_with_battles_now_on/,18,37
