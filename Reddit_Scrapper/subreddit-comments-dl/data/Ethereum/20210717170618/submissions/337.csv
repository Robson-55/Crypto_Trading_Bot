7x1dw2,1518448605,insomniasexx Community Opinion,"IMHO,\n\nI think the view of the more visible members of Ethereum community on what happened with MEW is not representative of the wider Ethereum community (see https://twitter.com/joeykrug/status/962085215916064768). From what I gathered, they are more shocked by the reaction of the community than they are of the actions of /u/insomniasexx. I think that's mainly because they know /u/insomniasexx personally and they let emotions / attachment (apparently she is very nice and hard working, who wouldn't like that) cloud their judgment. Let me explain more precisely what I mean by that.\n\nPersonally I only study what I need to study online and have no interest in going to public conferences / gatherings. The way I see it is those end up being expensive and I don't learn as much as I can learn online, at my pace, quietly. Also, I don't have a technical level where having a discussion with Vitalik or other projects lead is going to help me more than just reading what's online (yes also most importantly, I would certainly waste their precious time). Actually if I did, I'm still sure live Hangouts are more effective, but different point. I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in this situation, possibly (or not, I don't know) the majority of the people in this ecosystem now function that way. So I've never had the chance to meet /u/insomniasexx. Which means, and that's what I think is **the point they are missing: like many others I put a lot of trust into online identities, therefore a breach of trust of such identity is a very important and upsetting event**. This exercise is particularly difficult nowadays with the increasing number of scam attempts, which only adds to the frustration when such breach happens.\n\nI have noticed a non-negligible number of key actors of the ecosystem sided with /u/insomniasexx. I think this is wrong. If anything, staying neutral would have been best. Right now we don't have a lot of informations, but we do know she stole the Twitter handle for her new project. By itself and **if she had appologized and immediately returned the handle, that would have been just an small mistake, no biggie, but that's not what happened**. We also know now that there's a lawsuit against her for not disclosing financial informations. And as most of us know, there's also all that:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wbemb/mycrypto_hostile_takeover_of_myetherwallet/\n\nAll in all, MEW is a key piece of the ecosystem and I feel it has been under attack. I know that /u/insomniasexx has done a great deal for this project to grow and I make sure to keep this in mind. But I will also watch what will happen next with a lot of attention. I expect full transparency and respect, if I don't get both, she won't see me on her new platform, and either way I hope MEW will remain strong. I mean we're all a happy bunch overall and that's great, but sometimes being critical and upset is not a bad thing to express ourselves when we believe something feels very wrong.\n\nTrust &amp; reputation is everything.\n\nCheers,\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7x1dw2/insomniasexx_community_opinion/,5,45
