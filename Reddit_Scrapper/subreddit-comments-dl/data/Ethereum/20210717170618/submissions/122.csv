7jbk3w,1513093733,Transaction Delays,"I am aware that there has been some slowness as of late due to kittens or something...but...was hoping someone could answer a few questions for me.\n\nI have recently acquired a Ledger Nano S and I am looking to transfer my ETH and ERC20 tokens from my Ethereum Wallet address to my Ledger Nano S address.\n\nAs a test, I sent a small number of ERC20 tokens in one transaction and a small amount of ETH in another transaction.  I selected the smallest amount of gas possible.  Unfortunately, I am at 48 hours and neither transaction has completed, and they appear as 'pending' on etherscan, but then disappear.\n\nHow long can I expect to wait for these to complete?  Should I be able to send ETH at higher gas rates while these are still pending?  Any insight would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jbk3w/transaction_delays/,3,4

7jbrpl,1513095575,Error in the Blockchain? Double Processed Transaction,"I posted a similar thread with few replies yesterday in /r/cryptocurrency, and Iâ€™m hoping this can get some more traction.  I transferred a small amount of Ether from one exchange to another during the height of the crypto kitty slowdown.  Once the transaction was finally processed, it was processed twice.  Although only X amount of ethereum was removed from my balance on Exchange A, 2X was received on Exchange B.  Exchange A sent me a message through their support ticket system notifying me of the double transfer and telling me this was due to a glitch in the Ethereum blockchain.  They have asked for my cooperation in returning the Ether with a fiat currency voucher as a reward, but this entire situation seems rather weird to me.  I am fully verified with the exchange so they have all my personal information.  Does anyone have any insight to this situation?
