7g1755,1511840487,Call me a dreamer,"I have been hypothesizing this concept for nearly 2 decades and it finally hit me: Ethereum is the answer.  I cannot give away my idea, but I need developers who are interested in impacting the world to help me with a non-profit ICO.  Here is what I feel I can share:\n\n1.  The total coin supply will be limited to the approximate population of the earth.  Since many people don't have internet access it will be understood that there will be many unclaimed coins.  Since we cannot know the exact population of the earth the coin supply will at no point in time exceed the estimated population of the earth.\n2.  No being will be allowed more than 1 coin or less than one coin; there are no fractions of a coin.  Adding new coins does not dilute the value of the coin because coins cannot be resold or transferred and therefore have no value since one of the underlying necessities to value is transferrability.  This will probably be among the most burdensome of concepts to the developer, however, there is no motivation whatsoever for a coin holder to hoard valueless coins that can't be transferred.\n3.  The total cost of the coin is exactly what someone is willing to pay for it.  The amount they are willing to pay is based on both the value they put on what the coin represents as well as what they can afford.  If they can only afford 1 cent, so be it, that will buy their coin.  Bill Gates may contribute 1 billion, some homeless person may spend 1 cent.  Most people won't even be interested.\n4.  The project is intended to be humanitarian.\n5.  It can change the world.\n6.  It can be huge.\n7.  You will feel good about yourself if we try and fail, but we won't.\n\nPlease message me for additional information.  I can pay you but the right person probably won't require pay.  If Ethereum is BitCoin 2.0  then this coin is Altruism 2.0.\n\nNaysayers, move along, please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7g1755/call_me_a_dreamer/,0,22
