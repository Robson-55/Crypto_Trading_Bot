7htlib,1512514731,Problem withdrawing from BitStamp,Hello boys!\n\nI recently bought some ETH to play with on Bitstamp. I already have a Ledger Nano S so I just installed the ETH wallet. When trying to withdraw Bitstamp notified me that the destination wallet needed to support smart contracts. Since I couldn't find the option in the ledger ETH wallet app I assumed it was on by default and sent the transaction to my adress. Now I can't see the funds and I also figured out that the smart contract option is on the device itself and was disabled.\n\nWhat can I do?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7htlib/problem_withdrawing_from_bitstamp/,2,14

7htnz4,1512515346,Some things I learned re delayed confirmations.,"I know many of you may already know this, but the recent congestion forced me to learn about how to overcome underpriced transactions and another issue.\n\nI made an EtherDelta transaction before realizing the CryptoKitty mayhem was occurring. This was via the MetaMask extension.  The first transaction did not get confirmed (I waited 20+ hours).  I had some ""self"" transactions with overpriced GWEI I tried to send to try to ""cancel out"" the underpriced one but MM likely just tried to send those as transactions meant AFTER (higher nonces) the one that was stuck.\n\nThe pending transaction would appear and disappear on etherscan every 30 minutes or so, and I could not use the cancellation feature of MEW as the Tx would never appear there when I searched for the txHash (with any of the node settings including Etherscan).\n\nI needed to send a transaction with the same nonce as the stuck one from somewhere.\n\nEssentially uninstalling and installing MM and restoring via the seeds and sending a high GWEI gas price transaction ended up working probably because MM was forced to send it with the same nonce (to replace the stuck transaction).  The rest of the transactions that had been broadcast by the former MM rushed through since they were overpriced.\n\nTHEN, I was making appropriately priced EtherDelta transactions but for some reason they would never get to any of the block explorers/miners after I submitted via MM.  I was thinking maybe it was MM's backend somewhere along the line.  I wanted to send the transaction via MEW with my own selection of a node.  This was not as easy because they were contract function calls created with EtherDelta+MM -- not simple value transfers. What I found was that MM has this Settings - &gt; Download state logs and if I knew the transaction hash of the stuck transaction, I could find the RAW signed transaction and then go to MEW and simply broadcast it directly (via the offline transaction page) with my choice of node.  \n\n(I also have my own local full node and was trying to use that for MM during this process but for some reason it wasn't working either).\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7htnz4/some_things_i_learned_re_delayed_confirmations/,1,1
