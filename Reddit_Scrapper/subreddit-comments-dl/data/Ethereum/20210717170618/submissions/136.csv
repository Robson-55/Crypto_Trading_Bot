7jyywi,1513334724,Help getting started with the ETH wallet?,"So for the past ~2 months I was simply mining to Coinbase and storing my Ethereum there, but I wanted an actual wallet and downloaded the ""official"" wallet, straight from the ethereum.org website. I've been trying to sync the blockchain but for some reason it gets stuck every time (I've tried using both the client with Geth built in, and Geth by itself) and neither seem to be working. My top end isn't on the right block and doesn't seem to get past 99% with ~160 blocks left. It had 166 blocks left to sync and in the last 24 hours it didn't even sync one. What am I doing wrong here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jyywi/help_getting_started_with_the_eth_wallet/,6,8

I wanted to use ETH as a means of transporting value there instead of Bitcoin because of the high fees with Bitcoin. So I sent about 0.2 ETH to the address generated by my Binance ETH deposit wallet more than 24 hours ago and nothing has happened yet. Looked up the wallet on Etherscan and it shows no transactions pending. The amount has been debited from the sending address at GDAX. Previously I sent LTC with no problem to Binance.\n\nAnything I'm missing as a newbie to Ethereum?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jz9hi/trouble_sending_eth_to_binance_any_advice/,19,6
