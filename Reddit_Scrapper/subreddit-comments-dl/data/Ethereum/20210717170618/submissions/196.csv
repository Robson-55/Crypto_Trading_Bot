I then had to stop it for 3 hours and restarted the Mist wallet. \n\nIt said I'd be 800k blocks short, so I could not send any Ether.\nI patiently waited for it to sync again but then my friend couldn't access his wallet for the same reason.\n\nPast night I left my PC on to make the transaction as soon as my friend is ready. \n\n\nI accidently cloesd the Mist wallet in the meantime and now I have to snyc another 400k blocks. \n\nTHERE IS NO WAY that many blocks were generated in just 5 minutes on the network.\n\nI am really pissed right now and need to vent about the atrocious usability of this official wallet.\n\n\nIf anyone has a hint how to solve this, please let me know. The Alts are not getting cheaper right now.\n\nEven Bitcoin with its high transaction fees would have been more reliable and cheaper in the meantime, considering the price explosion of ALTs in the past few days.\n\nTLDR: Mist wallet is always missing a few hundred thousand blocks every time I close it, even though I was full synchronised before.\nI use geth to sync since an error message pops up every time I try to sncy via Mist only.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7nugmk/mist_wallet_trying_to_send_ether_to_no_avail/,1,2
