7dg9a6,1510873327,Question about Ethereum supporting National Voting,"I am somewhat new to Ethereum and the Smart Contracts so still trying to make sure I understand all the nuances, etc.  \n\nWhat I am trying to figure out is would it be possible to support a national election process based on current laws.  \n\nI understand that a voting contract can be created to support a voting process but at the national level there are some caveats.  \n\nSo... I get that I can register with a State using an Ethereum address that gets tied to me as a person (yes, kind of defeats the anonymity) and where the State determines I and my account is an eligible voter. I understand (maybe not the best approach, but anyway) that the State can create VOTE tokens which it then looks up their voters, sees how many votes they are able to cast in their districts and send to the voter's Ethereum address the requisite number of VOTE tokens.  Obviously, contract rules would be attached to the VOTE token that stipulate they are only good until 7PM on the night of the election at which time they become void and that only one VOTE token can be transmitted per recipient address.  The idea here is that I will ""pay"" with one of my tokens to ""Vote"" for a candidates address. \n\nAll that seems straight forward but the issue is the State knows my address yet when I vote it has to remain anonymous to everyone expect me.  So when I pay my VOTE token, I can see the transaction on the blockchain and that my token was recorded just as I expect.  \n\nBut the State should be obfuscated from seeing my address pay the candidates address.  So is there some way in which the transaction is recorded on the blockchain such that my transaction is validated and visible to me but if someone like the State was to decrypt the transactions all they would know is that one of their assigned VOTE tokens was used to pay a candidate.  \n\nIn this way, the State know that only the tokens they send were spent as expected and my vote remains secret.   I understand that transactions are cryptographically signed so does that come into play here to hide my vote?  \n\nVery thankful for any insight into this.

7dhhpy,1510884328,All my Ethereum stolen out of my wallet **UPDATE** My Thank You Letter,"First off, I'd like to thank everyone who worked with me yesterday to help me with the loss of my BTC and ETH.  I learned a lot through conversations with many of you and I can't thank you guys enough.  \n\nIn the wake of all this madness, a kind redditor reached out to me in a private message offering to reimburse the ETH I had lost, so long as I beefed up my own security.  We exchanged back and forth for a while, discussing better security measures and new options for storing my coins.  He was kind of enough to share his own knowledge and experience with me and I was happy to listen.  Whether or not he intended to actually help me recover my losses, and to what extent, was somewhat unimportant as I obviously had much to learn.  Ultimately, he generously gifted me nearly **all** of the money I had lost.  \n\nI was blown away to say the least and don't ever recall a stranger showing me so much kindness.  I'd like to publicly thank this redditor (who has asked that he remain anonymous for good reason) for not only gifting me the coins I lost, but for educating me while restoring just a bit of my faith in humanity.  Something I think we'll all pretty short on these days.  \n\nThis experience has shown that everyone is prone to error and that you can never be too careful.  But it has also shown me that every once in a while, strangers tend to show some kindness to others.  Additionally, it has reaffirmed my belief that it is always the best course of action to admit fault in an attempt to learn from your experience.  Pretending you did nothing wrong *only makes things worse.*  I intend to build upon this experience and sincerely hope that I can do the same thing for someone, someday.  I am very excited about the cryptocurrency space as a whole and fully plan on becoming as involved as possible.  However, without the help of the community, I would have been totally lost.  Now, I can take this experience and share it with others to prevent future things like this from happening.  \n\nThat being said, if anyone who comes across this thread is curious about BTG (BitcoinGold) please be extremely careful about your information.  **Never** give out your personal seed for your wallet!  I know that should be obvious but anyone can be fooled.\n\nThanks again everyone, you've all been a huge help! Also, shoutout to /u/jprichardson (Exodus Co-Founder) for showing up and helping figure out the source of the hack.\n\n**TL;DR**: I lost a significant amount of money in a hack and a kind redditor reimbursed me for my losses.\n\nEdit: This is for those who are asking how the attack was carried out and what mistakes I made. (Mostly copy pasta from the other thread)\n\n&gt; While it makes me feel like a dumbass, I did attempt to check MyBTGWallet as I was curious about BTG and wanted to know if there was any to claim etc. Initially, I went to https://bitcoingold.org and saw their address check box, after inputting my address, I seem to recall there being a link to https://mybtgwallet.com/ underneath the box. So, I clicked on it and was brought to the site, but as I was extremely hesitant to give out any of my information, I tried to assure myself it was legit. It displayed a valid SSL Certificate at the time of my visiting so I decided I would proceed. Unfortunately, this makes it pretty clear that it was all my fault. I'm embarrassed to say the least, and certainly heartbroken at my losses. I guess I'm a little new and didn't think much of it when I was asked for my seed, looking back that's pretty fucking stupid, there's no reason they my seed right? But the valid SSL had me fooled. I will surely never do something so stupid again and will take steps to increase security on my own. However, I do think BTG and MyBTGWallet should take some blame for this as they are not ensuring the security of their users/potential users but ultimately this is clearly my fault.\n\n/u/jprichardson expands more on in detail as to how this happened here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d7sq8/all_my_ethereum_stolen_right_out_of_my_wallet/dpwphw5/\n\nAs for safer practices.  I've ordered a hardware wallet and plan to store all of my coins on there from now on.  In the meantime, I've enabled 2FA on just about everything I own.  (Email, Facebook, etc.)  I moved all of my coins off of my desktop as many of you have recommended; as they apparently exhibit more vulnerabilities than other options.  I've also locked away all of my keys in a much safer, password-protected place, but plan to move all of those offline as soon as my new wallet arrives.  I've also reset my Google Chrome settings, deleted any saved passwords that might carry over to anything important, and cleared cookies, history etc. as well as changed all of my passwords to make them much more secure. \n\nAs for advice from the anonymous donor.  Here are some of the things he shared with me.\n\n* He advised that even with a hardware wallet, malware can intercept transactions and change the destination address before it goes into your wallet, so exercise extreme caution when making transactions and try and make them from a *clean* system ~~is~~ if you have access to one. \n* Exercise caution if you are a miner and try not to store any of your coins on said mining rig as they can be easy targets for malware.  If possible, use separate machines for trading, storing, and mining. Another option for this is to create a virtual machine where software is segregated -or- even consider swapping out HDDs (possibly one with Linux instead of Windows) to to trading operations.\n* Double check that the address has not been changed in your clipboard by pasting it elsewhere before initiating your transactions.\n* Minimize the amount of software on the computer you are doing your trading on to reduce risk of infection.  In addition, use a clean browser with no extensions (except for Metamask which apparently protects against phishing attacks).  \n\nThanks everyone for reading.  Sorry for the wall of text.\n\n\n**TL;DR 2**: I stupidly gave out my 12-word recovery seed to site that appeared safe.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7dhhpy/all_my_ethereum_stolen_out_of_my_wallet_update_my/,312,119
