7f162i,1511458536,Help understanding programming language tradeoffs between Ethereum and Neo,"I'm quite new to cryptocurrency, and am having trouble finding information on one key tradeoff that I see as critical in the differentiation between Neo and Ethereum. That is - the choice to allow C# and eventually python as dev languages on Neo vs exclusively Solidity on Ethereum. It's obvious that using established programming languages is preferable, and I read that Solidity is developed with security first in mind. I also have read that Solidity is optimized for memory management which should make the ethereum network more efficient. There's something else here though that I'm not seeing and I'm not sure what it is. How do these choices affect each network as it scales? How does this favor into the fee structure of each network? Is Neo at risk of being less secure? I wanted to get this communities take. Any resources or comments you all can provide would be enormously helpful. At this point I'm less a fan of ""pure currency"" cryptos and a huge fan of the ecosystems that ethereum and neo are trying to build, just would like to understand them much better.
