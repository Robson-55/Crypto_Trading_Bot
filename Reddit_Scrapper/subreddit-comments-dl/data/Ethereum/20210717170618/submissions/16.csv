7bfux4,1510085454,When to use Ethereum?,"Ethereum is regarded as Web 3.0, but as a novice amateur front-end web developer, planning to make a website that requires a database; voting; accounts, I fail to recognize if I *should* use Ethereum for something. \nSome ignorances that I have are: can a website be run as a DApp? Can a voting mechanism be implemented through smart contracts (I assume it can) but is that really necessary? Is it too early for a website to try and implement Ethereum? Should I even bother researching Ethereum since I have no experience with back-end web development? \nI heard Andreas Antonopoulos say that many blockchain projects nowadays use the decentralized buzzword, but don't really need to be decentralized.

7bfww6,1510085897,Corrective Hard Forks,"I just wanted to share my thoughts on how I think of “corrective” hard forks (“bailouts”).\n\n\nReality...  **Absolute immutability** of a public blockchain meant to be used in a way ethereum is not consistent with reality in the practical sense.  If we are to “move” to a cryptocurrency type of world, we have to consider the responses to certain rare, unexpected, and catastrophic events.  But… Trust of a decentralized system that follows set rules (code being law) gives significant value.  This is fundamental.\n\n\nWhen the system requires change to address these exceptional problems, you have to weigh the damage this does to the inherent value of the system against the benefits.  I make the claim that a practical system will at times require changes (hard fork (HF)) but should only HF if:\n\n**The need is so great that it outweighs the value of “code is law.”**\nThings to consider\n\nMaturity of the chain\n\n-Fresh, beta, infancy vs. mature, global, decade+ usage\n\nAmount of ETH or value at risk\n\n-10% or 1% of total ETH is different than 0.01%\n\nWho is at fault?\n\n-Gross negligence?\n\n--E.g.:  A physical bank leaves the doors open to all the vaults and does not monitor them, after which all the money is stolen/lost is different from a bank that takes appropriate measures and is robbed by a 1000 Martian army with advanced alien technology.\n\nIs the underlying system at risk or just an isolated user/company/contract?\n\nPrecedent:  If such an **adequately similar** situation arises again, there will be force in order to be just, to treat it the same way.\n\nAND\n\n**Be combined with significant proven community support for the change.**\n\nFor example, significant affirmative support from a supermajority of ETH.  Absence of a vote is presumed to be a “no.”\n\n\nCombining changes into one HF only saves to reduce the number of HFs (which can be nice) but doesn't address the underlying issue of what should be included in a HF.  The latter is the real question.\n\n\nConsidering the above, for (a hypothetical intoxicated fat fingered) me to expect a hard fork to return 1 ETH that I accidentally sent to the wrong address is stupid.  The blockchain is **not** greedy for failing to accommodate my silly situation, just because it is trying to maintain its long term value.  What is greedy, if anything, is me expecting the system to screw itself so I can recover my funds.  Now the world is not black and white.  This is an easy situation.  The more difficult situations are in the gray.\n\nHFs will be required, but not all HF are the same.\nThe DAO situation is not like other situations.\nJust because one bailout has occurred, doesn't mean all others are equal or should happen.\n\n\nSummary:\nA corrective HF may be appropriate and the right thing to do but only if it outweighs some fundamental values (e.g., code is law).  Such changes must be strongly agreed upon by the community (or else face centralization).\n\nAnyways... just my thoughts.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bfww6/corrective_hard_forks/,0,0
