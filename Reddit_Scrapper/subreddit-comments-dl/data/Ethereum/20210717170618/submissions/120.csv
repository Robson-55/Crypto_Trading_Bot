The app is just acting weird and I've tried it on 2 separate machines. First, it started asking for outrageous fees to transfer my 0.92 ether. It wanted 6 ether for fast and 2 for cheap. When the fees randomly went back to normal, the transaction never went through. The transaction never showed up on the blockchain and it stayed on 0 of 12 confirmations. Now it just never fully syncs and shows 0 ether. Most of the time it just sits there not downloading blocks.\n\nAny ideas on how to get it out, either by fixing the app or importing the wallet into a different app or something? I tried a different wallet program but they all ask for the 12 word backup phrase but I created this wallet on myetherwallet.com and I only have the private keys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7j82mc/i_cant_get_my_ethereum_out_of_my_wallet/,7,3

7j9el2,1513067936,Ethereum &amp; alts - as scaling off-chain solutions for Bitcoin - BTC has already scaled,"**BTC has already scaled - Ethereum &amp; alts - as scaling off-chain solutions for Bitcoin**\n\nHave you ever thought about it that way?\n\nBitcoiners are thinking of scaling, lightning, off-chain networks that can ""scale"" millions of transactions per second, etc.\n\nBut not many realize that side-chains mainly are actually just a ""balance"" somewhere off-blockchain, you have to top it up, and then you can use it.\n\nThink of it just like an exchange - you top up the balance by sending one big transaction there - and then trade it multiple times, with as little values as you like, for a very low fee.\n\nBut what I also realized - that Bitcoin ALREADY has side-chains - many of them. They're called **alts**.\n\nYou don't pay with bitcoin anymore. You just transfer one big transaction of BTC through Shapeshift - to buy Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, or whatever chain - the another blockchain, where the transactions are cheaper than in BTC. You use them, and when you need to withdraw - you transfer back to BTC and out to your bank account.\n\nSo, BTC had already **scaled**. And doesn't need any ""lightning"" networks, cause there are networks like ETH - who deal much faster and are cheaper to transfer. And also being real blockchains - they're truly decentralized, and have their own value. And are already accepted in many stores. News like Steam abandoning BTC in favor of other chains - only confirm this thought.\n\nThe only thing left - when people will realize this, they may understand that they can use ETH or other crypto's straight away - and when exchanges realize this - there will be no need in any middle-men universal slow&amp;expensive currency, like what Bitcoin is today.\n\nThat's why I'm also skeptical about off-chain scaling solutions - cause that just means creating another ""currency"", accessible only through parent currency - and we had much of that already - just choose what you like - exchange to it - and ""scale"" there.\n\nThoughts?\n\nP.S.
