7i30kv,1512611256,Introducing a new kind ICO: The Autobid Contract! A way to test the tokens functionality before you decide if you want to keep it.,"The team at Delphi.Systems have come up with an interesting new token distribution method that rebalances risk and developer incentives.\n\nBy setting up a contract that exchanges their token at a fixed rate, and allows users to get a full refund(for up to 6 months), they've built a way for you to actually use the token and see if you like. There's no risk to trying it out except for the gas costs of a couple transactions.\n\nThis takes all the risk off the token users and put it on the team. If the usefulness of the token isn't perceived to be high enough they'll end up with nothing. To steal my own phrase from another comment ""This is the strategy of a team confident in success and willing to lay it on the line to show us what they have before asking for the money.""\n\nIf this peaks your interest, please take a moment to look over the medium article describing the approach.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@DelphiSystems/the-autobid-contract-token-distribution-2-0-925f9921d644\n\nEdit- To learn more about the Delphi Systems project please consider reading over the white paper.\n\nhttps://delphi.systems/whitepaper.pdf",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7i30kv/introducing_a_new_kind_ico_the_autobid_contract_a/,1,4

7i39z2,1512613768,"No worries, the Kitties hype will fade soon, here's why","No worries guys, in a few days/weeks we will (hopefully) back to normal, here's why:\n\nThe game itself basically a zero-sum game (except for the Gen0 cats) between the players and the guys how have been around from the beginning who now have a big cat herd can continue to breed basically for free (except for the fees) while the new players are buying their cats. For the new players the game will only stay profitable as long as there is a constant inflow of even newer players who buy off their kitty babies.\nBut with the increased fees and decreased kitty prices (prices are steadily dropping since the price peak around 2 days ago) the game has become a lot less profitable to play now. If you were to enter the game now, it's waaaaaay harder to make profits compared to a few days ago. Once people realize that the gains are marginal and not worth their time and effort anymore, they will stop playing the game. Sure its fun to breed some cute rare kitties, but it's only fun for a few days or if u can sell that rare kitty for a lot of ETH. On that note, it has also been noticeable that the relative price difference between shitty cats and cats with rare attributes is getting smaller compared to the early days. And since the prices of basic cats are highly inflationary due to the exponential breeding of new cats and even the kitties with rare attributes are getting less valued by the market, playing will become even less profitable in the future. So unless a huge number of new players enters the game (which I personally doubt unless Asia picks up the game like crazy), the hype will fade soon.\n\nI've been playing the game since day two and I just sold most of my kitties and I basically stopped playing today. I'm sure a lot of other people will do the same as well soon and the number of pending tx as well as the gas price will decrease to normal levels (hopefully).\n\nAfter all, I see the Cryptokitties Hype as quite positive because it showed us how bad the need for  fast effective scaling is. If even a single fucking dApp (about pictures of kittens?!) can crush the network, then we have a lot of stuff to improve still ;)\n\nfml, a week ago I would have never thought that I would write a market analysis about the digital kitten market.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7i39z2/no_worries_the_kitties_hype_will_fade_soon_heres/,3,3
