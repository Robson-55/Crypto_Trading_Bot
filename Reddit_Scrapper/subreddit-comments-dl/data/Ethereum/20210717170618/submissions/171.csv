It was said to be algorithmic but such that it looks random with probability proportional to eth owned. Where is this algorithm executed? Does each node execute this algorithm? Is it some kind of smart contract or would that be too circular?\n\n2) how does PoS not just cause the wealthiest to control more and more of the currency over time, eventually centralizing the network? Is there a cap on how much chance you can have on generating the next block?\n\nThank you!\n\nThanks so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7m0nt2/help_me_understand_casper_and_pos/,10,10
