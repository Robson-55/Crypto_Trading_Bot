I need your help!,"Hello redditors!\n\nToday I have been dabbling with the idea of opening a physical local store which will provide the average person with information and the opportunity to purchase crypto. We would provide services such as opening a wallet for them, explaining how to purchase/sell crypto etc.\nI am sure there is a big market for it. I have been in crypto for almost 5 years and get contacted often by old friends/family asking if I still do crypto and how they can get into it.\nThere is a gap in the market and I am ready to fill it. People are scared by the overwhelming information and publicity and I want to help them overtake that step to the actual purchase of crypto.\n\n\nI am writing my businessplan as we speak but was wondering if you guys have any tips/ideas of things I could/should provide to the people.\nAny ideas are welcome. I have been brainstorming with a few friends all day and we keep coming up with new stuff.\nTogether we can make the perfect business and provide the perfect user-friendly experience to the mass!\n\n\n\nOur business will be located in the center of a big student city in Europe, there is no competition at the moment.\nI was also wondering if anyone has any experience with the legalities of a crypto-index/fund?\n\n\nThanks in advance fellow crypto-lovers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ql4hx/bringing_crypto_to_the_masses_i_need_your_help/,12,13
