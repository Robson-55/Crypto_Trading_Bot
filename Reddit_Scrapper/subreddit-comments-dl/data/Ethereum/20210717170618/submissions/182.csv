7mqnk5,1514506761,I have some questions about sharding.,"You probably get this question all the time but from what I understand, the Ethereum blockchain would be divided into different shards based on different applications? So would there be a shard for each different DAPP? And would miners randomly verify transactions in different shards?

I guarantee that the site won't be for-profit, no ads, and we'll keep everything transparent and clear. And I'd really appreciate if people here make some insightful comments on some projects.(it's still kinda empty, I'll trying to put my comments in couple of days)\n\nTook me a while before writing this post since it might sound like promoting our service, but again please do generously understand that neither this nor our main project are commercial purposes.
