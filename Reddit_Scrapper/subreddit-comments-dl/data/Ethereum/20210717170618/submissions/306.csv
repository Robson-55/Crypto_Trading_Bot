7ummi4,1517524083,Enough time has passed to say that Ethereum Name Service is a massive failure. Who is using it? Redesign from scratch please.,"Nobody is using ENS. Why? Because it is over-engineered and complicated. The team who built it felt were far too ambitious when designing this system. Something like this needs to be as simple as it can be. I scratch my head when I think how Vitalik Buterin signed off on such convoluted design.\n\nHereby, I assign the ENS team to redesign the entire system from scratch, so that also my grandmother can setup her own ETH name as well, not just the guys with IQ of 140. Scary is bad. Simple is good. Elegant is good. No need to win a Nobel prize for science on this one guys.\n\nYou have failed once, but you've learnt valuable lessons.
