7na72n,1514746110,Hope for lost private keys or passwords? Please tell me where I'm wrong with this idea. (quantum),"*Preface: This is not meant for debate about whether quantum computers (or any advanced tech) could ultimately crack current encryption methods. For the purposes of this, we assume that, in the distant future, they _will_ be able to and do it quickly/inexpensively.*\n\nUnfortunately, I'm in the camp of people who lost access to an account due to lost private key or password. At the time, the funds were worth &lt; $1000 but are now worth almost half a million. Thankfully, I covered my ass and have done just fine, financially, but as the price goes higher and higher, seeing those stuck funds on the blockchain (and the ETH classic chain) stings a bit. So I do a lot of brainstorming about how I might one day recover them. Here's an idea which I'm sure is wrong (I'm neither a quantum nor cryptography expert), but would like feedback about why it's a pipedream.\n\nHere it goes. A tx signature (to move funds from an account) requires:\n\nf^(traditional)(private key + password) = signature\n\nNow fast forward, say, 20 years deep (2037) into the era of quantum computing and assume that, unless Ethereum (and BTC, etc), hard fork to quantum-resistant encryption, every account could be easily cracked by brute-forcing a transaction signature directly. (no need for private key or pass)\n\nNow assume that Ethereum, in anticipation of this, *did* fork to a quantum resistant system before this became a problem such that old-style signatures are no longer accepted by the network. Only signatures generated according the new encryption scheme would be accepted.\n\nf^(traditional)(private key + password) = signature (*rejected*)\n\nf^(quantum resistant)(private key + password) = signature (*accepted*)\n\nFinally, assume that someone lost their private key OR password (not both) way back in the day. Even though Ethereum no longer accepts old-style signatures, couldn't one brute force the missing private key or password? That is...\n\nf^(traditional)(private key + a zillion password permutations) = signature (*rejected by network, but still verifiable as correct or incorrect with the old methods*)\n\nThen, once the missing private key or password is discovered...\n\nf^(quantum resistant)(private key + recovered password) = signature (*accepted*)\n\nTL;DR - Assuming quantum will be able to brute force signatures, does possessing either the private key OR password give an advantage and a potential route for recovery?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7na72n/hope_for_lost_private_keys_or_passwords_please/,5,6
7na83z,1514746401,MyEtherWallet + Trezor,"Hi all,\n\nI'd like to move my ETH from a paper wallet into my Trezor along with my BTC.

7na9ds,1514746747,Security of Bitcoin's Proof of Work vs. Ethereum's Proof of Stake (Casper),"I'd like to talk about a rarely-discussed security problem of coins with a capped issuance, including Bitcoin. Their developers are hoping that their economics work out as block rewards diminish, whereas the Ethereum developers appear to have thought the issue through more thoroughly - another reason why I find them to be so insightful. People piled on Vitalik when he said the inflation rate under Casper will be whatever it needs to be, without realizing that this is the best possible answer.\n\nBy that I mean:\n\nFor a system to remain secure, there must be a cost to performing an attack, and ideally a further risk if that attack is unsuccessful. The system must then be able to pay any costs incurred in disincentivizing or defeating these attacks.\n\nEthereum's proof of stake is superior to proof of work on all of these dimensions - but let's set that aside for a moment, assume the costs are equal between the two systems, and define some terms for this simplified argument:\n\n* A = the cost of carrying out an attack\n* R = the potential reward of carrying out a successful attack (e.g. the highest amount anyone could profit from a double spend)\n* P = the cost to prevent an attack - this should be equal to A times some constant k\n* N = the cost per day that the network pays to prevent attacks. This cost is paid to miner/stakers by block rewards and/or transaction fees, to incentivize them to secure the network.\n* T = the highest amount that users will collectively pay in transaction fees per day to use the network\n* B = the value of block rewards per day that the network pays out (ultimately, the cost being paid by coinholders as inflation)\n\nWe'll also assume that potential attackers are economically rational in the sense that they will only spend money to attack if they feel they can profit more than the cost of the attack.\n\nThus, the network being secure implies that:\n\nA &gt; R\n\nLet's explore this inequality. Since P = k*A,\n\nP/k &gt; R\n\nAn equivalent condition for security is that the network will pay the cost necessary to prevent attacks, or:\n\nN &gt;= P\n\nSubstituting, we have:\n\nN/k &gt; R\n\nNow, N &lt;= T + B, but for Bitcoin, if block rewards trend to zero then N &lt;= T, and\n\nT/k &gt; R\n\nSo, if the users are not willing to pay at least R*k in daily transaction fees, the network will be insecure. Whether this will be true for Bitcoin in the future is far from being a certainty. It's quite possible that it's just not economically viable to run the Bitcoin proof-of-work network in the long term as block rewards diminish.\n\nWith a currency that maintains some level of inflation, you have that B variable providing additional security. With Casper, you have that factor in addition to more favorable values of pretty much every constant involved. When you can tweak inflation, you have much more flexibility to keep A &gt; R. Inflation is a hindrance to usage of the system as a store of value, but far less so than having an insecure system.\n\n**TL;DR**: If there's no inflation, then transaction fees must be sufficient to cover the costs of maintaining security, and we have no guarantee that this is the case.\n\n---\n**Philosophical Addendum / Strawman Q&amp;A**\n\n""But I want a currency with no inflation.""\n\nWe've just shown that it might not work, depending on how much your system costs to secure. Interesting fact: the Bitcoin network is using more electricity than Denmark and is rapidly growing, while staking will just require ETH and uptime. But I'd like to offer up a philosophical argument too.\n\nWho benefits from the network? People who store value on it, and people who use contracts/transact on it. Everyone who uses the network takes both of these roles, but to widely varying degrees. To say that there should be no inflation is saying that one arbitrary class of users should get the benefit of the network for free, while another class should pay disproportionately.\n\n""But I want digital gold.""\n\nYou still pay each day to secure your gold. You spend time to find a secure spot for it, you pay people with strong buildings or guns to protect it, or you pay the risk that someone will take it. A store of value that is automatically and costlessly secure is still a fantasy. Cryptocurrency still offers many benefits over other stores of value, let's be realistic about the costs involved.\n\n(note: please do point out any errors I've made - I've written this to the best of my knowledge but could have missed something)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7na9ds/security_of_bitcoins_proof_of_work_vs_ethereums/,77,17
