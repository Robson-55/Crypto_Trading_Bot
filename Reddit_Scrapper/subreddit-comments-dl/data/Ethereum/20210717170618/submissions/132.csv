I know scaling is still an issue, but it should be in a better place by next summer when people have time off of school... right? \n\nMy mom is from Venezuela, I have a friend there...

However, since all Ethereum is open source code, what would stop any competing blockchain from applying it to their own chain, thus leveling the playing field? If Ethereum were a corporation, it would be a tightly held secret and the competitive advantage would hold but if the EF plan on publishing the sharding code (which, given how VB and others have published their research as they’ve gone along, we have little reason to doubt) then how does that give Ethereum an advantage?\n\nPS - I am a holder and a believer.
