However, they no longer provide the option of converting the DAO to ETH on their platform. I'll therefore have to do so through some other means.\nHow can I convert them to ETH before I'm no longer able? I'll reward the person(s) with 1 ETH.\n\nI've tried sending a small amount of DAO to MEW v3.3.7, however, my DAO balance will not load and I am therefore unable to convert that amount to ETH.\n\nI have also tried to convert DAO from MEW V3.11.2.1, however, the option to convert to ETH is no longer available as it is in the older version. Please advise. I'll be sure to tip you for your help. Thanks in advance.\n\n*Please up-vote thread.

I can see on etherscan that it still has a balance so I'm not panicked or anything, but on Mist it's showing 0.  \n  \nThis is after I moved it from the old version of Mist. I moved it by going to the keystore folder and copying the file and pasting it in the keystore file for the new version of Mist.
