7lksbr,1513981916,Unable to restore multisig contract,"I was using a wallet on my Macbook and decided to back up my accounts earlier this year.  It turns out this was a very slow platform to load blocks and sync with the network, so I created a VM elsewhere.  I'm trying to re-import my accounts and wallet contracts, but no matter what I do I'm unable to restore the multisig contract I created.\n\nI can view the address on etherscan and I see the ether is in the account.  I can also still see the contract on my old Macbook wallet with the ether in it, so it appears that I didn't completely lose everything.\n\nI've tried to import the contract, but when I do it simply tells me ""This address has no wallet contract"".  I've tried to add it as a watched contract, but the value remains at 0 ether.  Both of my multisig accounts imported back to the new Ethereum wallet just fine, so I'm confused why this isn't showing up properly.\n\nMy old Macbook was using a 0.8.x wallet and the new one I have on the VM is 0.9.3.  I'm tempted to try to withdraw everything from the Macbook contract back to my normal account, then just create a brand new contract on the VM.
