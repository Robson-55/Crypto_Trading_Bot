7nyarl,1515018519,Rakshe: Smart contract insurance platform - user survey,"Hi! I'm Rohith a co-founder of [rakshe.com](https://rakshe.com). We are working on a platform where users can insure smart contracts and recoup losses in cases of hacks, bugs etc. We believe that this will improve DApp adoption as users can confidently interact with smart contract without fear of losing their money.\n\nBefore insuring a smart contract we'll be auditing and testing code to identify bugs. Along with us auditing the code, we'll be contributing to public bug bounties in order to financially incentivize developers to read more smart contracts and identify bugs. This helps DApp users by reducing the number of bugs that make it to a production environment, benefits us by identifying bugs before we insure the contracts and benefits the Ethereum ecosystem by improving adoption.\n\nThe policies themselves will be issued as tokens on the blockchain and policy holders will have control over how much their coverage is and when it is active. They are free to even transfer the policy to another address or sell it if they no longer wish to use the contract that is being insured by the policy.\n\nThe website has quite a bit of information on what is planned and we'll be publishing a whitepaper soon with more details. Please do take a look at the site, any feedback is appreciated. In the meantime we're trying to gauge the community's interest in such a product. It would be really great if you could [fill a short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWNJGKdF5i3E2LgoO8b4LRPRIgU3-kysV709tgbPc8rU2h6Q/viewform?usp=sf_link). The survey takes less than 2 minutes and no personally identifiable info is collected.\n\nI'll be around if anyone has questions or feedback. Thank you for giving us your time :)\n\nPS: You can view a summary of responses collected so far at the end of the survey.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7nyarl/rakshe_smart_contract_insurance_platform_user/,2,0
