It also lacks things like exchange rate support and doesn't currently display pending transactions. That being said we've been using it for a few weeks and the currently exposed functionality should be quite stable.\n\nThis beta will install _over_ your existing Bread app, so if you had one before, it will replace that app. The Bitcoin support is the same as the app store, so it's completely safe.

7epega,1511338793,Trying to build a simple IoT device via Ethereum. How to/resources needed.,"Hi everyone. I’m a student and working on a project with Ethereum. I’m new to all this so please be nice if I misunderstood some basic concepts. \n\nI’m trying to build a simple IoT device based on Ethereum. The main idea is to have a simple device (maybe a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino) light up one of three leds based on a Ethereum transaction. There might be better ways to do this but right now I´m thinking about creating an account for my device and sending it a small amount of ether (like 0.0000001 - 0. 0000003 or something) the device should be able to react to the transaction and light up the relevant led. \n\nI did some googling and could not find anything that looked like this, is it even possible? I must admit I never worked with either the RaspberryPi or the Arduino board, but a step learning curve is included in my plans 😊. \n\nMy end goal (and the reason why I use Ethereum and not just do it the normal way) is to create a trusted log of the interactions with the device as well as assuring the owner of the device that only Myself (my Ethereum address) can interact with his device in predefined ways (1-3 in this example). \n\nI´m not sure if this is the right forum for this but it was my first go-to address. If someone knows a better place to ask my question, please feel free to tell me 😊. \n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7epega/trying_to_build_a_simple_iot_device_via_ethereum/,6,11

7epuk0,1511344603,Is there interest in the community to use postgres as backing db (in addition to leveldb) ?,"hi guys,\nI keep seeing errors around leveldb (like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3g094i/really_stressing_right_now_ffatal_blockchain_db/), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4lb8gc/mist_load_error_fatal_blockchain_db_error/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4j5m7y/mist_073_leveldbstorage_error/) ).\nIf you move on to doing anything even semi-serious in ethereum, there is a significant amount of time you have to spend to make sure your db doesnt go haywire.\n\nPostgresql has a built-in high performance key-value type called [JSONB](https://blog.codeship.com/unleash-the-power-of-storing-json-in-postgres/). Postgresql is ACID and ensures a high degree of data safety thus avoiding issues like [Bitcoin's UTXO spam attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6z776p/breaking_bitcoin_day_2_livestream/dmwxrm6/) \n\n&gt;What doesn't help this is LevelDB's transaction format: when you update the utxo set, you want to do this atomically (otherwise you may end up with a corrupted state). To do so, you start a DB transaction (do not confuse this with Bitcoin tx, this is just how you build a change set before pushing it to disk), update the change set then commit the tx. With LevelDB, as long as the transaction is live, the entire changeset will remain in RAM (usually a DB engine writes the changes on disk as you provide them, then updates internal pointers at commit time to apply the change), basically double dipping on the RAM hogging and I/O inefficiency.\n\nPostgresql has managed solutions like Amazon RDS, Google cloud SQL Azure Postgresql and Heroku that makes worrying about data safety unnecessary - these come with 99.9999% guarantees. The high performance hosted version of postgresql is Citus Cloud. These are all production ready and already used by millions of users and some of the biggest companies in the world.\n\nDual support of leveldb and postgresql is not going to be superhard - considering postgresql has a key value native datatype. People can choose whether they want the convenience of an embedded db or the power of an enterprise grade db. Since most [blockchain analysis tools](https://blog.timescale.com/analyzing-ethereum-bitcoin-and-1200-cryptocurrencies-using-postgresql-3958b3662e51) are built around postgres, this will also open up the developer ecosystem around ETH.\n\nany thoughts ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7epuk0/is_there_interest_in_the_community_to_use/,1,1
