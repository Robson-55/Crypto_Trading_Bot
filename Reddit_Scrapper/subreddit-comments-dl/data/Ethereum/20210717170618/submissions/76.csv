7gkpkx,1512027582,"I was on a really amazing podcast and if you like podcasts you should give it a listen: Going Deep with Aaron Watson #264: Taylor Monahan, Building a Wallet on Ethereum üòª","**I want to say THANK YOU to Aaron Watson for having such a thoughtful conversation with me this week: [Going Deep with Aaron Watson](http://www.goingdeepwithaaron.com/podcast/264-taylor-monahan-building-a-wallet-on-ethereum). Let us know what you think!** üôå üíÉüèø \n\nAaron always ends his podcast with a ""challenge"" for listeners. My challenge (below) is for listeners, but also a something we at MyEtherWallet have been actively working on ourselves: \n\n&gt; Be more aware &amp; mindful of how you respond when people are asking for help or guidance, even if it doesn't seem like they are looking for help. Especially on reddit / social media, it is so easy to dismiss comments or questions as, 'that person is a troll' or 'that person is an asshole' or 'that person is stupid'.\n\n&gt; Pause for a moment and be mindful of the experience that person is having. Even if they are yelling and screaming, try consider if it's due to lack of understanding, a really really bad day, or something else. How do you respond? Is there something you can do to prevent this in the future?\n\nWe at MyEtherWallet are doing our best to understand and help educate and support the *underlying* cause of their question, message, or really really really really angry email. (*e.g. our recent [""Getting Started with MyEtherWallet""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ggc0c/getting_started_with_myetherwalletcom/) pop-over and posts!*)\n\nFor those who don't know, MyEtherWallet has grown from a team of 2 to a team of 17 in less than 5 months. Growing isn't easy, and making decisions &amp; dealing with hard questions with an international and ever-growing team is not something I would recommend doing for fun üòú. I am incredibly lucky to have found such amazing people to join #TeamMEW, but we are even luckier to have a supportive community around us.\n\nWe massively appreciate you for sticking with us, letting us know what you think of us (constructively is preferred üòâ), and helping those around you become more well-versed and secure in this crypto-world. With another big price jump and influx of new users, everyone (including us) needs as much support as possible.\n\n### Going Deep with Aaron Watson #264: Taylor Monahan, Building a Wallet on Ethereum\n\n- [Via his website](http://www.goingdeepwithaaron.com/podcast/264-taylor-monahan-building-a-wallet-on-ethereum)\n\n- [Via iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/264-taylor-monahan-building-wallet-on-ethereum-common/id1016307641?i=1000395298924&amp;mt=2)\n\n- [Via Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/aaron-watson/going-deep-with-aaron-watson/e/52354588)\n\n- [Via TuneIn](https://tunein.com/radio/Going-Deep-with-Aaron-Watson-p945585/?topicId=118210349) (*Warning: Autoplays?*)\n\n### If you love him, follow him...\n\n- https://www.facebook.com/goingdeepwithaaron/\n\n- https://twitter.com/AaronWatson59\n\n- https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronbwatson/\n\n\n### Other fave episodes!\n\n- [#159 Joseph Lubin, on Ethereum, Decentralization, and the Future of Everything](http://www.goingdeepwithaaron.com/podcast/159-joseph-lubin-on-ethereum-decentralization-and-the-future-of-everything)\n\n- [#239 Erik Voorhees on Bitcoin, ICOs, and the Future of the Internet](http://www.goingdeepwithaaron.com/podcast/239-erik-voorhees-on-bitcoin-icos-and-the-future-of-the-internet)\n\n- [#244 &amp; #245 Brendan Eich, Creator of JavaScript Protects Your Privacy &amp; Gets Kind Words from Edward Snowden](http://www.goingdeepwithaaron.com/podcast/244-245-brendan-eich-creator-of-javascript-protects-your-privacy-gets-kind-words-from-edward-snowden)\n\n- [#262 Why You Should Freeze Your Stem Cells Today, According to Dr. Mark Katakowski &amp; Steven Clausnitzer of Forever Labs](http://www.goingdeepwithaaron.com/podcast/262-why-you-should-freeze-your-stem-cells-today-according-to-dr-mark-katakowski-steven-clausnitzer-of-forever-labs) \n    - *Fun fact: Mark, Steve, and I created [hubski.com](http://hubski.com/) back in the day.

7gltfs,1512042682,The DAppening is almost upon us - 2018 will be a transformative year for Ethereum!,"We're all here because we believe Ethereum has utility.  \n\nHowever, much of this utility up until now has been speculative. There haven't been many apps we can point to which highlight Ethereum's real-world use case. [EtherDelta](http://etherdelta.com/) was a great first step, but its primary function is to speculate on the utility of the platform rather than to use Ethereum for some function external to itself. \n\nBut we are now at the dawn of a new era of Ethereum's growth. The first wave of long-awaited applications recently launched or are about to come online. This marks the transition from speculative utility to genuine utility and will begin the realisation of Ethereum's vision. \n\nHere I try to compile a list of what those applications are. If I miss any, please add them in the comments. (Note: not all are strictly DApps, but all use Ethereum smart contracts as a core part of their functionality). \n\n- **[Augur](https://augur.net/)** - A decentralised prediction market which allows people to place bets on the likelihood of future events. Prediction markets use the ""[wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)"" to more accurately predict things like election outcomes than traditional polling. *Status:* [Undergoing internal audit and finishing UI](https://medium.com/@AugurProject/augur-weekly-development-update-november-29th-4290f77e478c).\n\n- **[Basic Attention Token](https://basicattentiontoken.org/)** - A project which aims to disrupt online advertising by rewarding users for their attention. *Status:* Live in the Brave browser and [usable with Youtube](https://www.coindesk.com/youtube-brave-browser-earn-bat-tokens/).\n\n- **[CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)** - Collect, breed, adore and trade a cryptokitty.

A bit like Tether - pegged to USD (not the IMF's SDR, as I previously stated), but with provable collateral. No trusting Bitfinex! *Status:* [Launching in December](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/7aog8v/dai_is_launching_in_december/).\n\n- **[Melonport](https://melonport.com/)** - A platform that allows people to build and manage hedge funds on Ethereum. *Status:* [Undergoing final checks before going live](https://twitter.com/melonport/status/935863420435517442).\n\n- **[Populous](https://populous.co/)** - A smart contract built to facilitate securitised P2P bridging loans for companies waiting for invoice payments. *Status:* [Public beta in Q4](https://medium.com/bitpopulous/populous-update-brace-yourselves-the-beta-is-coming-9926ef1acc9f).\n\n- **[Request](https://request.network/#/)** - A layer on top of Ethereum that enables the creation and tracking of invoices and request for push payments. *Status:* An early version will be [launching on mainnet Q4 2017](https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-november-10th-2017-a57193780ddf).\n\nDisclosure: I don't own a stake in any of the apps mentioned here other than by holding ETH, which I think will benefit from their success.\n\nEdit: **Additional apps suggested in comments with recent or near-term launches.** I have left out apps that I cannot find a recent status update for.
