7be9cb,1510071884,The case for a new new Kill model,"This Parity bug got me thinking that we have plenty of critical infrastructure deployed, with very little oversight on how its running, when state is changing, and who is changing that state. \n\nWe know that bugs will always happen, and in the traditional software world you accept this and focus on detection and recovery, which are two steps we don't seem to focus on in the world of contracts.\n\nFor example, if I deployed a contract holding millions of dollars in funds, there is a chance that an unknown bug will allow an attacker to kill my contract and take the funds. Since I know I can't catch every bug, I want to detect when a bug occurs and have time to respond to it.\n\nThat got my thinking about how we should implement kill in our contracts, and it seems to me that something like this is a step in the right direction:\n\nPseudo code:\n    \n      uint kill_block\n      address kill_beneficiary\n    \n      event InitiateKillLock(uint _kill_block, address _beneficiary);\n      event Kill(uint _kill_block, address _beneficiary);\n    \n      function begin_kill(address _to) onlymanyowners(sha3(msg.data)) external {\n        \n        kill_block = block.number + &lt;number of blocks until kill using safe math&gt;\n        kill_beneficiary = _to\n\n        InitiateKillLock(kill_block, kill_beneficiary)\n      } \n    \n      function kill() {\n          if (kill_block != 0 &amp;&amp; block.number &gt;= kill_block) {\n              Kill(kill_block, kill_beneficiary)\n              suicide(kill_beneficiary);\n          }\n      }    \n\nIn this model, if someone does take ownership of my contract, they can't kill it right away, instead, they have to transition it into the 'Kill' state, and the kill operation will be locked for a specific number of blocks.\n\nWhen this happens, I should have infrastructure that is subscribing to the InitiateKillLock and Kill events, and that infrastructure should alert me that state has changed. \n\nThis same mutli-step model can be used for other operations, such as changing contract ownership. There could be a proposal to change ownership, a time to contest it, and then another call to actually change it.\n\nWhile that doesn't let me fix the issue that my contract is being killed, it allows me visibility into the fact that someone is changing state, and it may provide me with time to mitigate the issue (assuming the new owner hasn't locked me out) or pull out my funds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7be9cb/the_case_for_a_new_new_kill_model/,6,7
