Feedback?","Hello,\n\nThere are quite a few sites showing crypto prices and related data, but I still felt it could be done better. So I worked 3 months with a friend of mine to create [CoinVision.io](https://coinvision.io/).\n\nWe tried to have a fast, mobile friendly frontpage and we think allowing you to star your favorite coins is very useful. Prices update automatically and in real-time as we pull data straight from 36+ exchanges (grows by the day). Finally we put a lot of work in the portfolio and alerting system, although it is still arguably far from perfect.\n\nWe'd love to hear some honest feedback!\n\n* Main page: [https://coinvision.io/](https://coinvision.io/)\n* ETH page: [https://coinvision.io/coin/ETH/Ethereum](https://coinvision.io/coin/ETH/Ethereum)\n* Compare page: [https://coinvision.io/compare](https://coinvision.io/compare)\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7gwin0/we_built_a_cryptocurrency_price_tracking_site/,7,2

7gwkgk,1512149686,I built CryptoVigil - a telegram bot to automatically track tokens in real time!,"Hi all,\n\nPlease try this new telegram bot I built for the ProductHunt hackathon: https://telegram.me/cryptovigil_bot?start=reddit.\n\nCryptoVigil tracks all your ICO (or any ERC20) tokens in one place using just your Ethereum address in real time. You either copy paste the wallet address or send a picture of its QR code and CryptoVigil takes it from there. Unlike other portfolio apps or websites, it automatically pulls all your tokens, every token transfer made, whether through ICO, exchanges or even Airdops. You also never need to part with your private key, which means even hardware or paper wallets work just fine!\n\nCryptoVigil runs its own Ethereum nodes ⛓to track token transfers in real time and hence alerts you via the bot each time you receive (or send) a token. Here's a quick GIF of it in action:\n\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/cryptovigil/screenshots/telegram.gif\n\nIt's still a work in progress and have a lot of things planned. Would love to get your feedback and/or feature suggestions here or on the Telegram Group.\n\nThanks,\nSwaroop",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7gwkgk/i_built_cryptovigil_a_telegram_bot_to/,8,1

7gyl51,1512166858,Some help understanding a transaction sent to my wallet contract? Please and thanks.,"Hi all,\n\nJust looking for some clarification. A while back I received a transaction for 0 Ether sent to my wallet contract which consumed a very small amount of gas (From this address: 0x18788edabbabc203bc7c157518dc4b2d4529f884). Unfortunately I am not very savvy when it comes to smart contracts and I cannot for the life of me figure out what this transaction is all about. I do not recognize the address and when I look it up on etherscan, it would appear that they sent more than a thousand such transactions over the span of about 24 hours. Most are outgoing tx like mine, but every so often a small but significant amount of ether was sent to their account. Can someone help me explain what is going on here? Is this an innocent use case or is something nefarious going on here? No txs ever left my account but I am wondering if I am somehow now more vulnerable because of something they sent to me in a contract or something.\n\nThanks for any insight you can provide.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7gyl51/some_help_understanding_a_transaction_sent_to_my/,1,1
