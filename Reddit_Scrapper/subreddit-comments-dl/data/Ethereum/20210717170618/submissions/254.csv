7qww33,1516147718,Dev Meetup,"大家好，\n\nFrom the last Dev meetup It seemed Greg Colvin being quite frustrated with the so called EVM 1.5 EIP. It's a bit strange to me to turn down someone like that since the middle of last year. I don't know if you - the team - care for that a lot, because it doesn't seem like it, I always hear ""Okay, cool"" or ""no problem"" from who, Hudson?\n\nThe decision process on EIPs, how to include them - who makes the decisions - is never clear - It's like waiting until some EIP emerges or others are forgotten. \n\nSo that was basically my takeaway from the last Dev Core meetup. \nMaybe you guys have some input.\n\nBut of course I appreciate you guys having an open discussion we can all attend :) This should not be read as a harsh critique rather than some simple things that drew some attention. Thank you\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7qww33/dev_meetup/,2,2

We're closing in on Eternal September and Up/Down votes aren't cutting it anymore. The old timers are getting tired of reading drivel and the newcomers are getting the wrong impression about what this sub is for.\n\nPerhaps, new and more active mods on the roster would assist, along with some clearer rules (like if the project name is in the title, it's probably an advertisement and not about the tech, or something to that effect).",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7qxp2v/mod_request_can_we_clean_up_the_sub_and_get_back/,1128,90
