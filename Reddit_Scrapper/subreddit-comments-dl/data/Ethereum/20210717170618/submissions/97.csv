7hv2uy,1512528466,Who is Ether for?,"This may be a misunderstanding on my part, but this is how I see things so far.\n\nLets suppose someone makes an Ethereum based app to track and trade the distribution of digital assets within a game (think accessories) where players are rewarded with a unique (cryptographically enforced) asset for completing a level and can trade this with friends, and potentially buy them with fiat currency. \n\nThe player never ""sees"" the ethereum network, and the ""value"" of these digital assets has no connection to the fiat value of Ether...\n\nPoint being, aren't the vast majority of Ethereum applications going to shield the user from the litteral Ethereum network? So why would the end user of a particular application / service ever want or need Ether?\n\nIt seems to me that Ether is ONLY the developer-oriented ""credit"" system to pay for processing time on the world computer??? Thus, like any other credit/point system, these will be purchased through some other more universal bearer of value (like fiat or BTC).\n\nJust want to wrap my head around it.
