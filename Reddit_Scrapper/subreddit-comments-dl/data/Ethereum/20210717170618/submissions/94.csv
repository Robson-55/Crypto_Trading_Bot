7hq7t9,1512486308,Our marketplace will use Ethereum for payment processing,"Our software for business management is used by more than 8,000 food businesses globally in the food service and manufacturing industry. One of the features that our product has is the ability to buy and sell commodities on our network. Our customers have requested that we add a method to process order payments through our platform. Our research has shown that traditional solutions such as ACH and wire transfers would not be suitable for the majority of our customers as they are located outside of North America. As such, we decided to pursue a solution that uses Ethereum to process payments between our customers. Our smoke tests indicate that there is support for this system within our customer network. Our solution involves our own token called ‚ÄúYUM‚Äù. We have opted to not conduct an ICO. Instead, we have built our own exchange that can be used to trade Ethereum for YUM.\n\n[FilletX Inspectus PDF](https://filletx.com/publications/filletx_inspectus.pdf)\n\nHappy to answer any questions here or privately!
