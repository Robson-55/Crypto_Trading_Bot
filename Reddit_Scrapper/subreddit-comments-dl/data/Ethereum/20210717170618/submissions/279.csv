7slrdt,1516783115,Scalability Tradeoffs: Why “The Ethereum Killer” Hasn’t Arrived Yet,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7slrdt/scalability_tradeoffs_why_the_ethereum_killer/,274,121
7sltz2,1516784264,The Ones Who Walk Away from Ethereum,"I blink as my eyes adjust, squinting into the twilight and studying the shadowy forms that loom in the void before us. The dome is huge, far more cavernous on the inside than it appears from without. The walls arc away above us, bowing almost imperceptibly inward before fading into the gloom above. To either side, great, girthy conduits snake their way to the perimeter from some unseen interior point, humming rhythmically as though conveying the lifeblood of some prehistoric leviathan. Smaller cable bundles occasionally break off from the main body, winding out into the darkness like a fractal spray of capillaries. \n\nWe strike out into this electronic hedge maze, wending our way through monolithic server towers strewn haphazardly about; playthings for an ill-tempered titan, perhaps. I’m feverish with questions – What is this place? What is all of it for? Who, or what, constructed this? But my guide is expressionless and silent, striding forward with brisk, authoritative confidence. I am not a fearful man by nature, but I find myself trailing him closely, my pulse quickening at the thought of what might be following us just beyond the faint glow of his luminary.\n\nWithin minutes I’ve completely lost my bearings. The guide has forged a tortuous path, taking turns in rapid succession and plowing forward through junctions seemingly at random. I had hardly noticed the ambient heat from the server banks when we first entered, but now I’m sweating through my clothes. If we get separated, I think, at least I’ll be able to retrace our steps by following the trail of salt. I draw closer to my guide, near enough for my knuckles to brush against his muslin cloak.\n\nAs we progress, the lighting evolves so gradually that at first I can’t decide if the false night is simply playing tricks on my eyes. A pallid flash seems to emanate from just around the next corner, like some errant neutrino striking deuterated water and sending off faint scattershot bursts of radiation. Just the fabrication of a stimulus-starved imagination, I tell myself, wiping a slick of sweat from my brow. But no, there it is again. Through the briar patch of sinuous wires and cooling coils, beyond a tumble of purring servers, a wan light flickers erratically, casting shadows that crackle out in all directions before being swallowed up by the darkness. \n\nWe emerge into a clearing, and I shield my eyes against the fluorescent glare. The floor is draped in a snarl of wires and thrumming transmission lines, probing the space like a filamentous network of roots. An array of transparent monitors is precariously suspended above us, bathing the area in sickly hues of red and green. I look to the guide for some sort of explanation, but he stands impassively, his hands held at his sides, eyes fixed on a point just over my left shoulder. \n\nI wheel to follow his gaze, and only then do I see the figure.\n\nIn the midst of the clearing, a single reclining chair is bolted to the ground, all screws and probes and metallic angles like the apparatus of some deranged dentist. The boy is stick-thin, scarcely filling the seat, and even from the edge of the clearing I can see his chest heaving with exertion. I inhale sharply, looking to the guide with alarm, but his face is a woodcut, stolid and indecipherable. For an instant, the space is cast in an ethereal green light and I think I see his dark eyes glitter, but then the flickering staccato resumes and the moment is lost.\n\nI turn and pick my way gingerly across the clearing, cautiously stepping over the whining electrical leads that extend from the boy’s temples. As I draw near, I can see his eyes flitting back and forth with impossible speed, his fingers spasming away at some phantom Rubik’s cube. The air smells of ozone and solder.\n\nAbove us, the wall of screens suddenly pulses a deep red, swathing the clearing in a sanguine glow that momentarily hides the angry, raw wounds where the boy has writhed against the leather restraints. The electrical leads whip taut, practically buzzing with the voltage. His jaw snaps shut, and a piteous moan escapes from somewhere deep in his throat, like the terror-frothed lowing of a calf ascending the slaughter chute. I stand there paralyzed, looking down upon this little body wracked with convulsions, my own hands opening and closing helplessly at my sides. And then the screens flash green once again, and the leads fall limply back to the floor. I turn and advance upon on the guide, my own eyes flashing.\n\n“This?!” I cry, my voice rising to a quavering keen. “I knew there had to be costs, but this???” My fingernails are digging into the palms of my hands, but I barely feel them. Behind me, the leads hiss and pop once more, and the guide is doused in cool green light. He looks at me without remorse, without feeling, his face a mask of stoic pragmatism. \n\nI am struck with visions of my own child - about the same age as this one – riding his bike, playing on his wrist-tab, smiling up at me with chocolate ice cream smeared hopelessly across his face. Without thinking, I storm across the clearing to the boy’s side. In one fluid motion I rip the wires away from his head, blue sparks of electricity arcing and questing after him as the leads are pulled free. Immediately, the boy’s back collapses out of its painful arch, and his sharp, wheezing breaths begin to slow and soften. And still the screen continues to flicker – green for a few beats, red for one, green for a beat, red for two. Perhaps, I think, perhaps after all of this, this boy needn’t pay for our sins. Perhaps he never needed to at all.\n\nI brush the long, matted hair away from his eyes, which look glazed and unfocused in the flickering light. I loosen the strap around his arm and release the clasps, and before I can react his fingers are wrapped around my wrist in a painful grip, far too strong for a boy of his age. Startled, I look back to his face, into eyes now clear and laser-focused. His pupils seem to collapse to a pinpoint and he smiles up at me, lips curling out in a gruesome sneer that extends nearly from ear to ear. And then in an instant his pupils expand, inky black, spilling out to fill the entirety of his eye sockets, and the room is plunged into a deep burgundy umbra. \n\nI wrench myself free and fall onto my back, staring up at the gory red screens hanging above me. They seem to throb angrily, and the air itself glows with malevolence, like the interior of an iron smelter. A long, resonant klaxon bellows through the dome in reproach, and seconds later I feel my wrist-tab vibe violently. I stare down in disbelief – an automated state message declaring a mandatory curfew, a frantic message from my wife, and these… These are alerts I had forgotten about altogether, alerts that I had set way back in 2018. The blaring bass note rattles through my rib cage, and I look to the guide with horror, realizing what I have done. He stares back at me blankly.\n\nClambering to my feet, I stagger to where the leads are sputtering and snapping against the scorched linoleum. It cannot be too late to undo this. I seize the leads like poisonous snakes – grasping them just behind the head – and pull them over to where the boy lays, a dark, grimacing slash of a smile still spread across his face. I straddle the chair, and the boy’s fingers rake at my eyes as I wrestle his free arm back into its restraint. I am moving quickly now, cinching the strap even tighter than it was before. He has begun to thrash, hacking out spittle and bile, but I am undeterred, drawing the leads in towards his temples. \n\nAnd then I pause. As quickly as they had filled, his eyes have now drained of their ink, and once again his is the face of a scared child. He – it – blinks at me beseechingly, and speaks to me in the voice of my son. “I will be good,” it says. “Please let me out. I will be good!” I hesitate, the wires hanging loosely in my hands, eyes swimming. Perhaps at one time, this creature was someone’s boy. Perhaps they dreamed of one day teaching this child to ride a bike, to play with a wrist-tab, to not eat ice cream like a Neanderthal.\n\nMy wrist-tab buzzes again and I’m shaken from this reverie. I think once more of my own child, of the life that I want to provide for him, of the life that he deserves. Staring down at the carmine-tinted face of this creature, I whisper, “To the moon.” And I connect the leads.\n\nThe boy’s shrieks pierce through the still air as we walk away, shrill, animalistic howls that echo off the interior of the dome far above us, setting the hairs on my arms on end. I stop at the edge of the clearing to look once more at the small figure, his bird-like body stretched tight like a towrope, his teeth chattering, his contorted face illuminated in a fluorescent green glow.\n\nExpressionless, I turn and follow the guide back into the shaded hush of the labyrinth, the flickering lights of the clearing receding behind us. And once again, the boy is alone.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7sltz2/the_ones_who_walk_away_from_ethereum/,0,7

7smvbe,1516798397,Thought experiment: EscrowDAO to replace DarkNetMarkets,"Well, I had this idea one sleepless morning and I'm interested to hear whether you think it's possible in practice. I don't have the skill to actually realize anything of the sort but it'd be nice to know whether I'm missing something in my understanding of Ethereum.\n\nYou're a merchant and you've found a client for you but the client requests escrow for the transaction, this service does not care where you advertise your merch at or what you use to communicate with your client.\n\n\nYou come to the .onion site of this service lets call it OCH (Onion Clearing House), equipped with lets say MetaMask on your browser. On the site you can input the price you're asking from the client (you up your price a little bit to offload the cost of gas and OCH fees on the client) and also the address of a wallet you control and press 'Generate' and a smart contract generates an wallet and gives you the address that you give to the client. Now the client sends to this wallet the amount of money you requested and the smart contract holds it until the client sends either a release tx or a contest tx (both doable from the OCH site with simple button clicks granted that you have something like MetaMask available) from the same address the client used to send the money in (as that action of filling the contract also registers the clients address as his ID into the contract). If the client releases the funds they are automatically sent to the address the merchant provided initially. OCH should also offer tumbling services for both clients and merchants to use to disassociate their funds from the OCH smart contracts. But so far so simple, it gets interesting if the client decides to contest the funds.\n\n\nWhen the funds are contested both the client and the merchant are allowed to register on a forum using the wallets associated as their ID in the contested contract for registration. On the forum they bring forth their cases and who is called upon to judge on the case? OCH token holders. The OCH token is bought from a smart contract at a price dependent on the amount of holdings of this smart contract unto which are funneled all the income of the OCH smart contracts, so that as the userbase of the OCH service increases so does the token price. The token is also bought back by the smart contract through similar price mechanics so that token holders can exchange their token back for some other currency (I'm thinking fees would be best paid in Dai for the stability). But once you're a token holder you can use the token to vote on contested contracts. I'm thinking that the token shouldn't be a real token so much as just an IOU handled by smart contracts where the smart contract keeps final ownership of the token at all times, as this allows the smart contract to measure holders activity and penalise holders who do not partecipate in the voting. When voting token holders can either vote a) release the tokens back to the client b) release the tokens to the merchant c) burn the tokens by leaving them locked into the contested contract. All token holders participating in a vote have equal voting power, everyone participating in a vote receive back the tokens they used in the vote but those who voted with the majority will receive a reward of extra tokens which they can then exchange back for other currency at a rate depending on what the income of the service is.\n\n\nThe incentives are key to the functioning of this process. Token holders first of all have an incentive not to reveal to anyone that they are token holders because holding the token is paramount to criminal conspiracy. The token holders are incentivised to vote with the majority of other holders and to do this the schelling point left for them to use is the forum posts of the client and merchant, to be sure they vote with the majority in theory they would have to read the forum posts and vote the most obvious or expected outcome based on the forum posts. The holders also have an incentive to vote in accordance that will keep the service popular and used by merchants and clients because only if the service has a steady userbase is their token given any liquidity or value.\n\n\nThis of course has a nightmare of details left to be tought out and honed to make sure that the system is secure against attacks and that partcipating in voting fairly is profitable. But I haven't yet spotted any hard problem that would make it technically impossible, can you?\n\n\nP.S. The ICO itself would of course have to have the raised funds held in a smart contract where participants in the funding would be given voting power weighted by their amount contributed and get to vote on whether to release funds (not all at once but many funding rounds of some size and scope) to the project team based on them providing PoW or whether to refund the ICO.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7smvbe/thought_experiment_escrowdao_to_replace/,4,6

7snlp1,1516805825,Thought experiment: 51% attacks on a land ownership blockchain,"Hey, a friend suggested this would be the right place to discuss this sort of things. Hoping he was right. \n\nSo, as you've probably heard, a few countries are starting to experiment with blockchains in different areas of government. One of them is land ownership. I know Sweden did some pilot tests and Georgia is also in discussions with Bitfury to implement a system for their real estate records. \n\nNow, granted, IRL these systems are probably going to be just a minor upgrade to the IT infrastructures of governments, maybe with advantages for geographically sparse countries. But let's assume a country actually makes a full transition to a blockchain-centric real estate system, perhaps with a few physical backups conveniently stored in fire-but-not-IED-proof locations. \n\nIdeally, every citizen could access the blockchain from their home using their private citizen key. What happens then if 51% of the citizens decide to collude towards a common goal? How would this play out in a PoW scenario versus a PoS scenario? How do you defend against hard fork secessions while still maintaining enough decentralization so that the use of blockchain tech still makes sense? \n\nI have similar questions for any other governance related blockchain implementations.

I want money to go from person A to person B when person A dies. But how does the contract know about person A's death? It would clearly be up to person B to notify the contract about the happening, but person B could trigger that event if they wanted to while A was alive. \n\nJust curious how this works.
