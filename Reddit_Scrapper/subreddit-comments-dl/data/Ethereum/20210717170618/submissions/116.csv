7iz44l,1512960276,What constitutes a ‚Äúblock withholding attack‚Äù?,"I am currently digging deeper into how plasma will work, and I came across something which I thought may potentially be problematic in my particular situation. Sorry if this is a very newbie question. \n\nI am wondering what would happen in POS block creation if your internet connection were to suddenly cut out. My internet connection is sometimes weak and momentarily loses the connection. I am wondering if this were to happen mid-block creation, would that potentially count as a block withholding attack (presuming I successfully created a block but then was unsuccessful in communicating that to the network), or some other kind of attack, or would I just simply miss he opportunity to create that block? Is this even something that is known at this early stage, or something still in progress?\n\nSo basically, is it known what would happen in a POS environment where internet connection were lost mid-block creation?\n\nAlso, am I understanding the word ‚Äúblock withholding attack‚Äù correctly?\n\nThank you for any enlightenment!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7iz44l/what_constitutes_a_block_withholding_attack/,1,7
