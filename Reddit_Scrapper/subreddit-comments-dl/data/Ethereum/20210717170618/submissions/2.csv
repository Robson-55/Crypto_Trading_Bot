I was experimenting with the Ubuntu version of the Ethereum Wallet (0.9.0) a few months back. I installed the .deb package. Yesterday, I decided to download the 0.9.2 version because of Byzantium. I downloaded and installed the .deb package as well. Did it just overwrite the previous version? How can I tell that I'm on the new version within the app itself?

7a4594,1509548778,Are there any projects focused on creating smart contract-based Ethereum to sub-currency/token exchanges?,I've done some searching and had a hard time finding anything. It seems like the ability to trade/purchase sub-currencies/tokens is limited to whether or not an existing exchange decides to support them. It would be nice to decentralize this and make it easier for people to create their own Ethereum to sub-currency/token exchanges. I'm considering starting this as a project but wanted to see what is out there first.
