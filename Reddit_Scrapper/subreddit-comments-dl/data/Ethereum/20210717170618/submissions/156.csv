7l42tm,1513801102,Can anyone ELI5 why someone would invest in an erc20 token instead of just ethereum?,"Firstly, my apologies if this isn't the right sub for this post.  There are so many erc20 tokens/projects that I'm intrigued by.  Naturally I purchase their token (to use some and hodl some).  Since erc20 tokens exist on the ethereum blockchain and gas prices are are universally recommended based on the ethereum network, why wouldn't an investor just buy ETH?  Could you think of the native ethereum token like buying an index fund, whereas the erc20 would be individual stocks?\n\n\np.s.  I know the stock market is vastly different than cryptocurrencies/dapps, but I'm just trying to wrap my head around this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7l42tm/can_anyone_eli5_why_someone_would_invest_in_an/,23,19

7l49cq,1513802655,Help using ethsnap (chain snapshot) to bootstrap geth,"Hello,\n\nI'm trying to bootstrap my woefully out of date geth environment.\n\nI've downloaded the most recent from the ethsnap site:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6f9xde/nightly_blockchain_snapshots/\n\nThe first thing I'm confused about is that the directions there say to put this into ~/.ethereum/chaindata.  I already have (had) an ~/.ethereum/geth/chaindata directory.  After putting it there and getting tons of errors, I backed out a bit and cleaned out my geth directory (I backed up my private key first).\n\nI have my history file (for console commands) and keystore directory.  I nuked the geth subdir.  I untar the snapshot into chaindata, and when finished start up geth.  I immediately get nothing but errors.  It seems like either something is wrong with the snapshot from that site or there is some other cruft that I need to clean out locally that I'm unaware of.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated as every mistake I make is leading to untarring the 50GB archive again.\n\nThanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7l49cq/help_using_ethsnap_chain_snapshot_to_bootstrap/,1,1

7l4avq,1513803003,Please help to advise a better design for Etheremon smart contracts,"Hi everyone,\n\nWe are developers of Etheremon dApp. Many of you mention about the potential risks in our smart contracts. Yes, it is our mistake. Instead of spreading the FUD, could you please suggest a way to help us fix it properly. We highly appreciate that.\n\nFor a quick fix, we can easily update the withdraw function to only get out our profit and do not touch on user's balance. It is easy but we get a problem with this approach (which leads to our unintended-design withdraw function like current one). We likely need to update the Etheremon Processor contract frequently as it is a game, some logic must be changed (such as add a new feature in battle, shop, transforming ..). If we do not have a good function to transfer data between old and new contracts easily, it will give a very bad user experience. For example, in the case of transferring Ether out of the contract, if we can only transfer the profit out, how can we transfer user's balance from the old one to new one. If let user make txn to transfer, it is very bad and not a friendly way (imagine we have thousands of users, how can we ask them to do that in short time). It would be great if you could help to suggest a solution, we are trying to fix it as soon as possible.\n\nHere is our smart contracts, there are two contracts:\n1. Data contract (should not be changed, as it keeps the sate of users): https://etherscan.io/address/0xabc1c404424bdf24c19a5cc5ef8f47781d18eb3e#readContract\n2/ Processor contract (should be changed time to time): https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a60806f05876f4d6db00c877b0558dbcad30682#code\n\nThank you so much",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7l4avq/please_help_to_advise_a_better_design_for/,95,43

7l4nyh,1513806162,People learning or interested in learning more about Ethereum,"I’ve been visiting r/ethereum along with other Ethereum based subs for around 6 months now, during which time my personal interest in all things Ethereum related has been gaining traction. I’ve wanted to branch out my research further to include more in-depth topics such as how to write Smart Contacts in Solidity and how to set up communications between the browser and MetaMask. \n\nI’ve noticed I’m not alone is this though, I keep seeing handfuls of posts asking where to learn more, where to even start as well as more technical questions from people wanting to push away from the very beginning stages.\n\nI’d like to suggest creating an Ethereum based cohort. People with similar goals coming together sharing resources, knowledge and amongst other things support. There isn’t going to be any kind of entry requirements, you can be either hearing about Ethereum for the first time today or already created a d’App or two! As long as you’ve got a genuine interest in learning more and/or giving a hand to people in need it would be fantastic to have you join.\n\nThis idea has already got a couple of people interested but I thought I’d post here to try and get a gauge of just how many would like to participate.\n\nThe cohort would be held on Slack but I’m open to suggestions.
