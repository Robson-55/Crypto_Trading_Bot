7g7nu8,1511904615,Is Ethereum crowdfunding dead?,"Considering all the ICO scams, I thought I'd do a brief overview of the issues and how various projects address these and what could happen in the future.\n\nRoughly there are two biggest issues:\n1) founders dumping tokens post ICO\n2) founders having access to all the ether raised immediately post-ICO\n\nIssue 1) is commonly covered by so called ""token vesting"", locking founders' tokens for certain periods. Commonly certain percentage is released each six months.\nHowever issue 2) is rarely addressed. While ICOs use voting mechanisms in the actual platform (i.e. [Aragon](https://aragon.one/)), for some reason seems [CryptoTask](https://www.cryptotask.org/) is the only ICO using voting to control the release of funds in stages post ICO. I am not aware if other mechanisms are used to address this issue.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the community will be able to structure the eco-system in a way to properly govern itself, or we will see governments stepping in more and more to regulate the market.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7g7nu8/is_ethereum_crowdfunding_dead/,182,46
