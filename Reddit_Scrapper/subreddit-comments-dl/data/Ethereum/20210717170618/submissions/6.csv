7ahflo,1509686982,"I Built A Crypto News/Content Aggregator, Feedback Welcome!","While purchasing cryptocurrency finding/keeping track of news/content was a pain in the ass. I had a small amount of free time so I decided to create an aggregator. I spent a few hours gathering social media links, icons, and crypto youtube channels. Every few minutes the content is pulled through the various API's organized by upload/creation timestamp and finally displayed in chronological order. Here are the page breakdowns: \n \n**Dashboard/Homepage** Displays a mix of content from all cryptocurrencies and crypto youtubers\n\n**Coin Page** Displays content from crypto youtubers only\n\n**Crypto Youtube Content** Display filtered content based on the cryptocurrency you selected, Also displays the social media, github, and tradingview ( chart forcasts ) links I could find\n\n*Each page displays content in chronological order*\n\nI will continue to add onto this service during my free time, including adding additional news/social media outlets.
