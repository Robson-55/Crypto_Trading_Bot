7bxsqm,1510275869,Any gaming on ethereum projects?,"Hey, it’s Matias @ Experimental (https://e11.io) - we were at devcon and met a few other teams working on gaming but mostly casino apps.\n\nI was wondering if there’s any other type of game being developed out there. What we’re doing is similar to Clash of Clans but every action is executed through smart contracts. Gameplay will be more transactional, more like the old good OGame. You create a village first, then you’ll be able to lock tokens to upgrade your buildings or summon a bigger army - by doing this, your offense will be more powerful but you’re also a more profitable target for your enemies, and if they win the war, they take your tokens.\n\nWe’re also building an Ethereum gaming organization - website and slack channel so the very few working on this can share resources.\n\nWe will also have online an ethereum-unity3D plugin super soon!\n\nAnyways, let me know what you’re working on!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bxsqm/any_gaming_on_ethereum_projects/,4,3
