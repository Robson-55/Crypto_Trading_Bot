At the time of writing this $100 worth of ETH is aproximately 0.076. So to enter that is the fee. One ticket per person, no more. 90% of the ETH taken will be given to the raffle winner. 8% will be kept for a monthly raffle with a bigger prize, and 2% for service.\n\nAnyone who has in interest please let me know. I'm not going to provide an address at this time as I want to see the interest prior to that. Any questions feel free.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7pj2gf/ethereum_lottery/,0,24
