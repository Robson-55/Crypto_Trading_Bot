7xt1sq,1518724666,Why can't Ethereum implement a feature to restore killed contracts?,"Contract address is determined by `keccak256(sender, nonce)`. That being said, why can't we implement a feature that would allow a contract to be redeployed? First checking there is no existing contract at the proposed address, then checking the sender address and the proposed nonce for redeployment (not to be confused with the transaction nonce) are valid and that the redeploy-nonce is less than the current nonce for a transaction, allowing the sender to fill that empty space with something.\n\nDrawbacks. \n\nThis could incentivize malicious developers to kill their contracts (if they have that ability built in) and re-deploy a malicious contract that does not do what the previous contract did. I think this is unlikely since the general use-case for killing a contract at will implies that it does not provide critical decentralized infrastructure, but it would require further investigation and understanding of the possible implications.\n\nThis also breaks the guarantee that if a transaction deploys a contract, the address will be the hash of the sender and the nonce. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but again further investigation should be considered.\n\nI think EIP 867 is absolutely not an acceptable proposal for the Ethereum project, but a logical solution that doesn't depend on human reasoning and impartialness could be beneficial.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7xt1sq/why_cant_ethereum_implement_a_feature_to_restore/,2,3

7xta3w,1518726515,Shower-thought: Blockchain as a tool for combating fake news and the manipulation of digital media,"Recently, Buzzfeed highlighted [the work of Aviv Ovadya](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/the-terrifying-future-of-fake-news?utm_term=.hbV3Njzjj#.mtY9ZGYGG), who predicts that in the coming decades, we’ll face a global crisis of confidence which he terms the “Infocalypse.” Ovadya is deeply concerned by the emergence of AI-infused software packages that allow for the easy, seamless editing of pictures, audio, and video to convincingly depict events and sound bites that never actually happened. Imagine, for instance, if a state actor released fabricated video footage of a political candidate in a compromising position, or sound clips from a supposed national ally in “secret talks” with an enemy. If released via social media platforms, and propped up by networks of bots/the occasional figure of authority with aligned interests, this sort of information warfare could readily sway public discourse, resulting in catastrophically negative outcomes.\n\nIf only, you might think, there were were a trustless, decentralized mechanism by which digital information could be assessed for its validity, and recorded on a permanent distributed ledger which could be retroactively referenced to determine whether it had been tampered with. In an era where the very foundation of truth and objective reality is under attack, wouldn’t it be great if there were some means of establishing shared, non-manipulable consensus about the legitimacy of information and the ordinality of events and transactions.\n\nIf this reminds you of the properties of the blockchain, congratulations - you have a keen eye for context clues! :)\n\nThe proposal is effectively this – could we establish a universal standard, wherein original digital video, images, and sound files are encoded with metadata that is committed to the blockchain? This metadata serves as a unique identifier for this source file, such that any future versions that incorporate elements of this source file are intrinsically linked via this reference ID, creating an ancestral history of the origin of digital media. This metadata may also be used to cross-reference a descendant version of a media file with its progenitor, in order to assess the ways in which it has been modified from its original form. Relatively benign modifications (say, video cropping or lighting adjustments on digital photos) would be no cause for alarm, but modifications which indicate the splicing of separate media sources or the use of more intensive video editing techniques, could be flagged as potential cases of misleading manipularion of digital media. In instances where the media in question is particularly inflammatory or consequential, a universally accessible, permanent record of the source of the content would be invaluable for assessing its veracity.\n\nNaturally, all future digital media will not be encoded with this blockchain-codified metadata. While one might envision a world where this sort of standard process is legally required of the manufacturers of phones, cameras, and other recording implements (much like the government enacts emissions regulations on car manufacturers), this seems like an unlikely outcome due to legacy devices, privacy concerns, etc. But, for journalists and news outlets with a vested interest in maintaining their irrefutable credibility, this could be a universal standard for the legitimacy of recorded media. The only digital media which garners trust would be that which has a time-stamped entry on the blockchain registering when, how, and where this media was captured, and how it has been digitally manipulated in the intervening time prior to publication.\n\nWe should expect that there will be malicious elements who will look to circumvent/corrupt this sort of system – if they can, for instance, edit a video to fit their agenda, and then re-record this edited video, this may be a way to circumvent hardware-encoded controls. Likewise, if the means of committing media to the blockchain can be corrupted (i.e. tricking the recording device into attaching metadata to an existing, untagged file, etc), this would be a significant point of vulnerability. \n\nI am not a tech/cryptography buff, and I don’t have the answers as to what measures should be taken to prevent these exploits. But, in light of the growing use of social media, bot armies, and AI-enabled media editing, I think this is something that the blockchain community should think about. Additional points of discussion include:\n\n* What are the risks of this sort of approach, both for personal security/privacy, and for corruption by malicious elements?\n* What are the technical requirements of this sort of system? How can we definitively capture the unique identifier of an original source file, with assurance that it is not derived from some prior source?\n* How can legacy images which lack metadata be validated and incorporated into this structure?\n* Should all images be committed to this structure? Or should it only be expected of images shared by news outlets, social media platforms, etc?\n* Is this approach feasible from a data storage perspective? Given the ubiquitous nature of recording devices in modern society, is it feasible to store the associated metadata for every image or recording that is produced?\n* Should this system be tokenized/monetized to encourage adoption (e.g. tokens awarded for committing original images)? \n* Is this within the purview of government regulation, or would the government be overstepping its bounds by enforcing adherence?\n\nIn case you’re curious as to whether blockchain has been explored for fake news prevention, here are a couple of related articles. The overarching theme is that news stories are validated via community curation, rather than immutable identifiers.\n\nhttps://thenextweb.com/cryptocurrency/2017/10/23/an-ico-for-blockchain-technology-that-disrupts-fake-news-is-the-most-2017-thing-ever/\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-can-you-use-blockchain-to-discredit-fake-news\n\nLastly, here’s a journal article from 2016 that discusses exactly this sort of approach (cryptographic image authentication), in much more rigor, but without explicit mention of blockchain as the associated data structure:\n\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7546506\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this - I would love to hear this community’s thoughts on this approach, as well as if there are any existing start-ups who are focused on tackling this problem.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7xta3w/showerthought_blockchain_as_a_tool_for_combating/,4,3
