7btfq1,1510235852,Notice about Raiden: state channel can burn deposited tokens. Security issues of ERC20.,"I'd like to write this notice, while no one has lost money yet.\n\n# Abstract\n\nRaiden state channel may burn deposited tokens in some cases. It is mostly a security flaw of ERC20 tokens, but Raiden is affected as it is a protocol that is designed to work with ERC20 tokens. ([source code reference](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/blob/258fe3aef6b626b591ec1c6a2428897d439abc0c/raiden/smart_contracts/NettingChannelLibrary.sol#L12-L14))\n\n# A brief overview of Raiden network.\n\nThe Raiden Network is an off-chain scalability solution of the Ethereum network and works with ERC20 token. The Raiden project is work in progress. Its goal is to research state channel technology, define protocols and develop reference implementations.\n\nRaiden is a combination of Ethereum-based smart-contract and off-chain protocol implementation that is relying on this smart-contracts.\n\n# Reminder about critical security issues of ERC20 tokens that already results in huge losses of money.\n\nERC20 standard tokens has two main issues:\n\n### 1. There are two built-in mechanisms for transferring ERC20 tokens.\n\n One mechanism (func. `transfer`) should be used for transfers in some cases and another mechanism (func. `approve`) should be used for transfers of tokens in some other cases. If you choose a wrong method of performing a token transfer then your tokens would get stuck inside a contract without any possibility to recover them.\n\nWe can argue whether choosing a wrong function is a user mistake or not, but it's obvious that if the function is designed to burn tokens then it should be named and documented as `BURN` function. If the function is named and documented as a function `TRANSFER` function to transfer tokens then it must not burn tokens even if some specific cases. If the token standard contains a function that is documented as `TRANSFER` function but it is burning funds in some specific circumstances then it's a security flaw. Moreover it already results in loss of more than $400,000.\n\n### 2. `transfer` function lacks event handling possibility.\n\nEvent handling is a standard mechanism in programming. Token transaction should be considered an event and should be properly handled. Unfortunately, ERC20 tokens do not provide such a standard transaction handling method. As the result, it's impossible to handle ERC20 token `transfer`.\n\nFor more information about the ERC20 flaws you can read my previous articles:\n\n[article #1 (General overview)](https://medium.com/@dexaran820/erc20-token-standard-critical-problems-3c10fd48657b)\n\n[article #2 (Contracts that are designed to work with tokens are dangedous)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6e8y9o/the_ens_contract_becomes_token_holder_erc20/)\n\n[article #3 (Reminder and other article references)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6uckdx/reminder_about_problems_of_most_erc20_tokens/)\n\n# The problem\n\nAs I wrote earlier, each contract that is designed to work with ERC20 token deposits is dangerous. This is because of ERC20 `TRANSFER` function that will probably burn tokens on deposit. This is because of ERC20 `TRANSFER` function that can not be recognized by the recipient contract: you can send tokes to the recipient contract but the deposit will not occur, because recipient contract did not handled your transaction.\n\nThat's about Raiden: when you open a netting channel, you will get a special smart-contract ( `NettingChannelContract` ) for this. You and other channel users should deposit tokens to the special `NettingChannelContract` to let your tokens go to the netting channel.\n\nI have [warned Raiden developers](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/issues/1105) about the problem and they said that they are aware of. I suppose that it is possible to introduce a mechanism to extract ""burned"" (not really burned, but buggy stuck) tokens.\n\nHere the problem starts: this is a special contract that is designed to work with token deposits, but it can not handle `TRANSFER` function executions. It is only designed to work with approved tokens. No one can save users from depositing into this contract via `TRANSFER`.\n\nObviously, netting channel contract must reject these `TRNASFER` deposits but it will not. All the `TRANSFER`red tokens will get stuck in each netting channel contract forever. \n\nObviously, netting channel contract must reject these `TRNASFER` deposits but it will not. All the `TRANSFER`red tokens will get stuck in each netting channel contract forever. \n\nNo one ever told users to deposit tokens to token contracts or the ENS contract but $400,000 were lost inside them. Now, we will tell users to deposit tokens to special contracts (where these tokens could be potentially lost because contracts are not rejecting wrong transactions and just burning tokens instead!) ... Prepare to bloodbath.\n\n# How not to be affected?\n\n(If you are (1) member of Ethereum Foundation, (2) security auditor or (3) senior programmer with many years experience then you should just skip this section. You are not at risk.)\n\n### DO NOT SEND TOKENS TO ANY OF RAIDEN CONTRACTS!\n\nYou should never send tokens to Raiden contracts if you don't want to lose them. You should call a Raiden NettingChannelContract and tell it that you want to deposit tokens. **The Raiden contract will take your tokens automatically!**\n\nIt is highly recommended not to call contracts directly. You should use a special interface that will properly deposit your tokens into Raiden channel.\n\nDo not use MyEtherWallet, ClassicEtherWallet, MetaMask or any other wallet that allows to send tokens to SEND tokens to a Raiden netting channels. All these wallets are using `TRANSFER` function of token to make a transaction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7btfq1/notice_about_raiden_state_channel_can_burn/,46,34

7btw86,1510240397,Might be a good idea,"Does anyone remember that one post on either here or r/cryptocurrency where some guy was the only farm in some country to accept ethereum or bitcoin? Along with the cleaning lady post today, that got me thinking that literally the only way this crypto thing becomes mainstream (like we want it to) is to not only promote it in any personal transaction we can, but to offer some kind of incentive like a 10% or 5% gratuity/discount to any service or product we sell or buy. \n\nIt could come off as scammy if someone offers you a small increase in pay if they choose to use your internet money they've never heard of before, but either they'll choose to look it up, become interested, and go through it with - or decline and go with fiat, no harm done. Even if they turn it down, it will stick with them if they ever hear of or read of that cryptocurrency again, which is how advertising works I think, mere repetition can make someone become more interested in something. I don't, but a lot of us have large sums of money in ethereum and if you really want this technology to move forward, it seems worth it to offer some kind of incentive to help market it, and I *do* think the incentive is important because it creates a kind of ""underground discount"" feeling which is very appealing to many people, in addition to the plain positive connection that a discount has.\n\nDownvote if it sounds like crazy nonsense, but it's something I'm going to do on all my craigslist postings for anything and when I try to buy anything through craigslist/facebook.
