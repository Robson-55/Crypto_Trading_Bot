We've finished up the first version of the Synapse decentralized AI marketplace well ahead of schedule, and we're reaching out to the community to join in and help out.\n\nWe're on the look out for two things: \n\n1. Developers: We're launching both the bug bounty, and developer's fund. What is the bug bounty? We want you to help pen test our contract for fun and profit. What is the developer's fund? We want to use the proceeds from our raise to help fund any ideas that can leverage our network, or that complement what we've built. We're all about that decentralized/distributed future for everyone.\n\n2. Partners: We've got a load of data and ml partners lined up that we're going to be announcing. We would love more to make this really robust. If you know someone that might be interested in partnering up, let us know.\n\nYou can check out our page for additional details here: https://synapse.ai/marketplace\n\nHit me up with any questions and I'll answer them throughout the evening and morning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7eg23g/call_for_devs_and_partners_for_the_new_synapse/,110,19
