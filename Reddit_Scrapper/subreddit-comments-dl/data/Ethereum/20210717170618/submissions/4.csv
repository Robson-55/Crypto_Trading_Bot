7a9ebq,1509598733,Should We Sue Google for Allowing Fraud Websites to Continue Advertising?,"If you have googled Raiden token sale or Raiden ICO over the past few weeks, you would have encountered various advertisements placed on top of the search engine. These advertisements read ‘Ryden’ or ‘Riden’ instead of ‘Raiden’ and they are fraudulent/phishing websites. Scammers behind these websites are basically spending thousands to switch around the first things we see on Google as we search for specific platforms/projects. \n\nAs such, many cryptocurrency and blockchain projects like Raiden and Proof Suite, are constantly being affected by fraudsters who set up duplicate websites with similar domain names. MyEtherWallet’s case is one of the most well-known ones out there which resulted in millions of funds getting stolen (myethewaillet.com, myetherwallet.cz, etc.). Fortunately, projects such as Raiden and Proof Suite were well-aware of the existence of these websites and are doing their best to notify users/prospects. \n\nScreenshot 1: https://imgur.com/D7fSyNF\nScreenshot 2: https://imgur.com/2EDVcSj \n\nAs a contributor of both projects, I have reached out to Google with several other community members many times over the past few weeks and they have not changed anything. The advertisements are still there and it made me wonder if this has got anything to do with the large amounts of money these scammers are spending on Google.\n \nWhat do you think? Should we sue Google to get them to do something? People are getting scammed from these websites and it certainly is affecting many newcomers. Please feel free to share your suggestions.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7a9ebq/should_we_sue_google_for_allowing_fraud_websites/,26,32
