7tnkvw,1517177805,What's the point of decentralized utility tokens if their value totally depends on the actions of controlling entities?,"If a project dies, the tokens lose their value regardless whether it was centralized or decentralized (bitconnect).\n\nProject owners are interested in success. In case of a centralized app, why would they sabotage themselves, unfairly editing the database or censoring good users? The logic is the same as in the 51% attack problem - it's possible but unprofitable for the attacker. \n\nCentralized apps can also be transparent and utilize blockchain technology, making the transaction history public and allowing anyone to verify the state. There are no transaction fees and confirmation times. Hacks are also much easier to handle since you are the government and don't have to deal with other parties. You make decisions that are the most beneficial for the project and the users. Was the $500 million NEM hack good for the network? Definitely not, people lost money to a criminal. \n\nSo, please, tell me the advantages of decentralization that outweigh everything that has just been said.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7tnkvw/whats_the_point_of_decentralized_utility_tokens/,12,11

Starts April 18, ends Aug 31, or as much of that subset as people are available.\n\nIt's a brand new effort, so I apologize for the web page looking so cheesy. It's just a [blog post](http://www.baylandsinc.com/2018/01/summer-2018-ethereum-infrastructure.html). My intention is to migrate that into a real web site showing our accomplishments once we get this off the ground.\n\nSome people have asked is this for real. Yes, this is for real! You can look at my posting history to know I've been around since 2013. Since it's a new effort and we don't have a history to point to, I think it may be a good match for someone wanting an internship to bootstrap your way into other projects including starting your own effort after you meet some people and develop some ideas. We have some good connections into people and firms who can fund such things.\n\nI'm happy to give more details about this project in a one-on-one setting.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!

7tq2rs,1517202953,Devil's Advocate - EOS is a superior block-chain implementation to Ethereum,"Not shilling - I am a huge supporter of Ethereum and other block-chain implementations. However, I think it is important to discuss the merits of each, and this is a great avenue. :-)\n\n\nAlthough EOS clearly sacrifices on decentralization (hardware and delegation of stakers), it gains immensely on speed, and also the ability to support different VM's. This makes it capable of running (easily coded) bandwidth demanding apps.\n\n\nAssuming both Ethereum and EOS are mature applications, with Ethereum using staking and sharding - would Ethereum be able to comfortably handle apps that EOS could handle?\n\n\n\nOr has Ethereum fundamentally lost speed and gained security/ decentralisation?\n\n\nIs Ethereum going overkill to decentralise, and sacrificing utility?\n\n\nAs an app programmer/ organisation, how valuable is decentralization to me, vs speed/ utility?\n\n\nAgain, I am just playing devil's advocate here, but it would open up a very interesting discussion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7tq2rs/devils_advocate_eos_is_a_superior_blockchain/,0,14
