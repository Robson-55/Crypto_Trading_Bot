7saxt3,1516672001,ETHRoyale: a Zero-Sum Staking Game Based on Smart Contracts,"I've been lurking here and holding ether for a while, and I wanted to stop in to show you guys my new DAPP game I made:\n\nhttps://www.ethroyale.io/\n\nThis is my new smart contract - based zero-sum game. Players will balance risk and reward and put their ether on the line in hopes of making more! The way it works is quite simple: every account is able to withdraw 0.05% more than their base deposited amount every block (approx every 15 seconds) once the game reaches 5 players. The name of the game is balancing risk and reward, so if you can withdraw with enough profits before others, you will be able to make profits. The reason I felt a game like this would be best suited to run on smart contracts is because I wanted to be sure the users could trustlessly interact with the smart contract without any possibility of admin intervention, so there no ways for anyone but the player to ever withdraw their funds. Furthermore, there are no admin roles built into the smart contract, meaning a fair game for all. This contract as well as many versions before it have been completely tested as bug-free on the testnet (Testnet Contract: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x7a6381ff5b8f8b83ddfabb3a1fba1f8be62f611e), but if you wish to check the code for yourself, it is verified on etherscan: https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4f4be28e8cb75b7bf30808bc5523d22a9ac3665#code\n\nIf you have any questions that aren't adequately answered by the website, feel free to ask them below or on /r/ETHRoyale.

7sb09w,1516672702,MEW/Digital Bitbox Question,"Hey guys, just got a digital bitbox in the mail after heeding everyone's advice to keep my coins off the exchanges.  I logged onto MEW to start transferring ETH and alts over, and I see that there are 5 or 6 different wallet addresses listed on the hardware wallet.  Basic question -- do each of these take one coin, or can  I send multiple types of coins to the same address since they're all ERC20?  I'm holding 10 or 11 coins so I'm just wondering if I'll need to have 10 different wallets, and how the hell I'm going to remember the addresses with no way to nickname them or view token balances immediately upon logging in.

7sccsa,1516686710,"eth-send: the core of eth-button, now as a standalone library","I decided to do some refactoring of [eth-button](https://eth-button.github.io/eth-button/), and put the core of the Ethereum functionality into its own library.  I had some requests around being able to determine when a send had succeeded, which was present in `eth-button` but not exposed.\n\nBy refactoring this into its own library, all of the core functionality can be used with whatever interface you'd like.  An example would be purchases of digital content, where once a transaction has been mined, it can be sent to a backend for confirmation.  The backend can verify the transaction, and then provide a download link to the end user.\n\nTo that end, I introduce to you: [eth-send](https://github.com/eth-button/eth-send).  Following in the footsteps of `eth-button`, it is extremely minimal and built for a single purpose: easily sending Ethereum.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7sccsa/ethsend_the_core_of_ethbutton_now_as_a_standalone/,31,7
