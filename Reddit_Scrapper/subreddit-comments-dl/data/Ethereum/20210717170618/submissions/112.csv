7in3m1,1512831036,Blockchain charity fundraising?,"I'm having a little trouble organizing my thoughts ATM, but my TL;DR is basically:  can a noob set up a trustless charity smart contract?\n\nDetailed version.  A coworker/friend of mine was killed on the job last night.  His wife and 3-year-old son are emotionally devastated, I'm sure, but financially as well.  I am not well situated to console his wife, but I could perhaps organize financial support.\n\nJust yesterday, on my way home from work, I heard another warning on the radio about false charities and untrustworthy donation takers.  It confronts me with the question:  how can I offer trust and transparency to those who must choose between donating to this cause over another?  I've been reading a lot about Ethereum lately, and a smart contract on the blockchain sounded like a perfect solution.\n\nI just deleted a whole paragraph that basically said:  I don't know what I'm doing, and I'm no programmer.  I've searched this sub a bit and found a reference to giveth.io, but it doesn't appear they're ready to start campaigns yet.  Am I wrong on that?  Are there any other prebaked blockchain services ready?  Any other thoughts I should entertain?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7in3m1/blockchain_charity_fundraising/,2,5

7inz51,1512839766,Ether stuck in Etherdelta address,"Hey! I wanted to buy some REQ yesterday, like 20h ago. I made a new wallet address on Etherdelta site and transferred some funds there. This was alright. But then I was not able to transfer those funds from the wallet to the Etherdelta address that is meant for trading. Tried depositing a few times but kept getting different errors - one saying that I must not have enough Ether for gas or just there is nothing to transfer. The other showed that the transaction will happen but nothing actually happened. I thought that this system should fuck itself and logged on MEW with the address I had created on Etherdelta in order to transfer the funds back to my personal wallet. No, could not do it. Out of the 20 times I have tried it, it has once appeared on Etherscan as a transaction in progress but has since just disappeared. I hate this shitty kittycoin so very much!\n\nAny ideas?

Simple transfers require no gas mechanics to understand, it will only cost 0.00021 eth. For transactions that invoke long contract code, the gas estimate might say: ""This is expected to cost as much as roughly 11 transfers.""  (aka 231000 gas, or 2.31 mEth)\n\nThis gives people a tangible anchor for gas costs, versus the abstract idea of 1 gas unit, plus the need to comprehend that 10 Gwei = 10 nanoeth, and its ramifications.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7io5cm/user_friendly_gas_pricing_in_multiples_of_a/,5,3
