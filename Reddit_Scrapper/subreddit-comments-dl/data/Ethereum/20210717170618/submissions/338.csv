The contract accepts guesses for a tiny payment of ETH and will pay out upon a correct guess. \n\nMy problem is that several functions are giving me flags about gas cost, estimating an infinite amount of gas. Any idea what I'm doing wrong?\n\nAn example is the takeAGuess function:\n\n      uint16 constant winningNumber = RANDOMNUMBERFUNCTIONCALL;\n\n     /**\n     *Use this function to take a guess. Transfer 0.00001 ETH to take a guess.\n     * There is a 1/100 chance you are correct. If you win, the function will \n     * transfer you the balance.\n     **/\n\n    function takeAGuess(uint16 _myGuess) public payable returns (bool) {\n        require(msg.value == 0.00001 ether);\n        if (_myGuess == winningNumber) {\n            msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n\nI appreciate any insight, on the code or where I could go to get some help!
