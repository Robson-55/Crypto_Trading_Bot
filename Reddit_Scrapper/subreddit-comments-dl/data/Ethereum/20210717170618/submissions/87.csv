7hdcpt,1512344407,How to know when you're dealing with Ethereum?,"Hi all.  ETH newb here... just wondering if there is a way to tell when a token is an Ethereum token?

7he07j,1512350983,"We're seeing Ethereum's ""Spacewar!"" moment.","I've been in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space since the early 2010 Bitcoin days, and I've closely followed Ethereum since it's inception. In that time, there have been a few ""holy shit"" moments where something triggers a brief foresight into what tech like Ethereum might enable 10 years from now.\n\nCryptoKitties combines very basic functionality of the Ethereum network (transactions that interact with complex contracts) into a game that's unusually fun to play. To create the market dynamic we're seeing, the game incorporates a few clever features that work together: a marketplace, trait scarcity, randomness, a lineage decay model, a minimum cost for a new lineage, cool-down, and of course, ""awww-inspiring"" kittens.\n\nThe exciting aspect of this game, though, is that all of the actual game mechanics are done completely without the use of a central server. You could extrapolate this idea a bit further and imagine:\n\n* CryptoKitties, instead of hosting assets on Google Cloud Storage, stores all assets on decentralized networks like Swarm or IPFS.\n* Continue the trend and imagine that CryptoKitties.co was instead CryptoKitties.eth, and that ENS domain pointed to a contract that could be rendered in a browser like [Moon](https://github.com/ethereum/moon-browser) (announced at Devcon3).\n* It's likely that even the future 2-7.5 second block time enabled by the Casper PoS consensus mechanism won't be fast enough for prime-time. Slap a Raiden channel on that bitch for low-latency transactions.\n* Are CryptoKitties transactions clogging the entire network with random adoption/cat-mating transactions? Put it all on a [Plasma](https://plasma.io/plasma.pdf) subchain contract. (I'm unfamiliar with hypothetical block times on a single-level Plasma PoS subchain, so Raiden might be necessary for low-latency transactions on Plasma.)\n\nThe implications of building dapps like this on platforms as capable as Ethereum are huge. The cost of data storage, infrastructure, and deployment is next to nothing, and this makes the only real barrier to launching a killer app putting it into code.\n\nYes, CryptoKitties is a very basic example of a decentralized game, and yes, it's clogging the entire network right now, but it's got me pretty excited about the future of dapps. [Spacewar!](http://spacewar.oversigma.com/) is considered to be one of the first real computer games to be developed, and could be an interesting analog.\n\nThoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7he07j/were_seeing_ethereums_spacewar_moment/,125,41
7he0r6,1512351130,Is there any way to prove an event happened in a contract without consulting the blockchain?,I've been thinking about mechanisms for moving assets between chains.

7hf4hh,1512363108,Cryptokitties is a blessing in disguise. It allows to stress the network in a harmless way (and it's also cute).,"That so many people want to use cryptokitties and, thus, use the Ethereum network to buy, sell and give birth to cats is not so surprising, seeing the previous pepe cards, beanie baby, pokemon crazes. This is currently putting a stress on Ethereum and testing its limits (yet we're far from them as gas limits can easily be increased with agreement from miners). \n\nWe know scability is one of the most important issues for public blockchains (if not the most important). It's not easy to have real transactions to test a public blockchain, people don't use it just for the sake of it.

Let's fix that!,"Hey guys.\n\nMy wife is a big fan of digital art trading platforms like Alacrity and Chicken Smoothie, so I figured she would love CryptoKitties.\n\nLong story short the ether I sent her to play with got stuck after MetaMask set a bad gas price with all the current congestion and her shiny new Ether got stuck.  I got it unstuck, so let's go from there!\n\nLet's un-stick yours!  What we are going to do is effectively cancel out the transaction that is holding up your account.  You may have to do this multiple times if you have multiple stuck transactions with too low of a Gas Price set.  Unfortunately, you will lose the fee, but your account will be unstuck, which doesn't sound too bad.\n\nFirst, let's go to www.myetherwallet.com\n\nThen you want to go to tab that says Check TX Status\n\nLet's go ahead and grab your TX Hash, which should look like this  on Etherscan:\n\n    TX Hash	0x22b3e759f8fac50f2d7a871525f55c411a21b3b42296200000000000000\n\nYou can find this on the left most column of your account, and you want to make sure it's the first stuck transaction on your account.  When you look at the transaction, it should say ""Nonce: 1"".\n\nLet's put that TX Hash into the Check TX Status and check it!\n\nWhoa, it's pending (we knew this).  Let's go ahead and cancel this transaction.\n\nWhat we are going to do is effectively ""update"" this transaction to cancel it out.\n\nGo ahead and make the ""To Address"" yourself,  then structure the rest like this.\n\n    Amount to Send\n        0\n    Gas Limit\n        21000\n    Data\n        This data won't be editable, you don't need to anyways, skip it.\n    Nonce\n        1 (Very important you make sure it's the same Nonce as the stuck transaction, this may differ depending on how many transactions you have done that haven't gone through.)\n    Gas Price\n        You want to make this 10% higher than what you originally used.  If the transaction continues to be stuck for a while, increase this again and submit again.  I used 30 Gwei, you can probably get away with less if you're more patient.\n\nAfter you have done this, choose a method to unlock your account, and then click on ""Generate Transaction"".\n\nAfter double checking it, send the transaction.\n\nGive it a few minutes and if the Gas was high enough, you will see a ""Self"" transaction on your account that will cancel out that stuck transaction!\n\nCongratulations, your account should operate properly now unless you have more pending TXs with too low of a Gas Price.\n\nSpread the word!
