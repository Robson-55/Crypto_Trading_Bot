A gas fee market is forming and needs to be addressed!,"Thanks to increased adoption, and lately cryptokitties, ethereum is once again running into the gas limit.  Miners need to up the gas limit again so we can continue to capture growth instead of sending development and interest elsewhere.  Letting a fee market develop is devastating to the utility of the EVM and will have serious long term consequences if allowed to happen this early in history (just look how almost all development/investment left bitcoin for ethereum).  We are still too far away from POS + Sharding to sit back and do nothing.

7hd1ot,1512341399,Ethereum stolen from single mom ETH miner. All 320+ coins taken! Please help.,"As you will read below, I have been victimized in a ETH hack and had 320+ coins that I mined stolen from me.\n\nFirst, let me address those of you that think this is a scam.  I get it.  I’d be skeptical too.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/3jhXQQt\n\nThis image I took today, Sunday 12/3/2017 and it shows me and my daughter, the wallet address that was compromised, a picture of me with my miners from 2016 and a reference to a previous Reddit post that you can view.  I had a random deposit from Ethermine the other day so I have 0.35 ether left which I will make a transfer of a small amount today to prove that it is my account.  Any other skeptics, I am happy to address questions and do anything I can to prove that my story is legit.\n\nWhat I am hoping to get out of sharing this story:\n\nFirst, I want to prevent others from making the same mistake.\n\nSecond, I want to connect with the community in hopes that there is something that can be done to recover my coins.  Yes, I know this is almost impossible but with this amount of money I have to try.\n\nAt the very least, I would appreciate if you could help get my story out there.  My crypto community is my only saving grace.  Share my story if you would be so kind.\n\nI’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t accept donations.  At the same time I want to be clear that donations are not what I am expecting from this post.  I’m not asking that you believe me but please do not be disrespectful with your comments.  I worked very hard to mine these coins and I already feel embarrassed and completely devastated.  I acknowledge that I made some mistakes but I was doing everything within my power and within my knowledge at the time to protect myself.  If I was the type of woman expecting to rely on others to get my by, cryptocurrency mining would be the last route I would take.  I'm a hardworking person that made a mistake.\n\nWhat I am not looking for:\n\nI’ve posted on other subreddits and I am aware of all of the possible ways I could have been hacked.  Rehashing that now is not going to change the outcome.  If you have solid advice or know anyone that might be able to help, that is what I am looking for.  I’m not looking for help finding out what happened, how I was hacked, etc. unless you feel that it will help get my money back.  I have the Ledger Blue and I was already taking appropriate steps to secure my funds, this obviously didn’t happen soon enough as there was a delay in it shipping to me.  \n\nAlso, I acknowledge that I had a password protected excel spreadsheet on my computer which, in hindsight, was my biggest mistake.  What’s done is done.  I take full responsibility there.\n\nMy story:\n\nI'm a single mom, a nurse, and trying to make it on my own.  I had almost no tech experience but took it upon myself to researched crypto years ago. I took a chance and built a mining operation in my garage. Months of blood, sweat, tears, sleepless nights and doubt finally payed off. I couldn’t believe I did it. Built computers, controlled the heat and they were up and running.  \nAs the coins came in my dreams for financial security were finally a reality. College for my daughter, paying off my car, my college loan all the things that seemed so out of reach were happening there in my garage.\n\nAnd in a moment it was all gone. I do not know how this happened and I've come up with a variety of scenarios. I did not share my information, I double checked urls before entering info, never opened suspicious emails, etc. I pulled all my ether off of any exchanges I had it on what I thought I was safe using MyEtherWallet. I ordered the ledger blue, which was in production at the time (Aug 2017), and I received it a couple of weeks ago (Nov 2017). When I went to transfer the coins onto the ledger wallet I was horrified to find all of my ether are gone! I'm devastated!\n\nThe strange thing about the situation is that the coins are still sitting on the address they were sent to. It appears to be a wallet and not an exchange address. They have not moved. I am confident I did not create this address because, had I done so, I would have definitely sent a test transaction and would never have moved that much money on one transaction.  I will place a watch on this address and hope that it someday moves to an exchange.  \n\nI shut down the mining operation about a year ago and I have no way to recover my losses. My dreams of being financially secure and providing for my daughter have been ripped out from under me.\n\nPlease if anyone can help me or knows anyone that could help me I will forever be grateful.\n\nOther facts:\n•	I did have some Ether Classic on that same wallet that were untouched. I have since moved it to the ledger wallet.\n•	Tokens on the wallet were also unmoved.\n•	No I did not click on any emails to access MEW. \n•	I never, in any form, shared my private keys with anyone.\n\nYou can verify the transaction here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa74fb87831b2d3182df8716ede01fdb0ea6a57fb\n\nThank you for your support. I hope to hear from someone that might be able to help. I know only a miracle could save it now.\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7hd1ot/ethereum_stolen_from_single_mom_eth_miner_all_320/,0,30
