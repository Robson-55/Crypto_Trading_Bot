How do you validate a block when you have no computing power? After all, in PoW, validating the code requires lots of calculation. Are there no calculations being done in PoS? \n\nHow many validators can a block have? Based on what criteria are they chosen?\n\nWhat will happen to all those ASICs once we more over to PoS? Looks like a huge loss for the miners, correct? \n\nAnd finally, it‚Äôs been said that the rich get richer in PoS. Sounds to me like we end up giving 99% of the wealth to the 1%.

Greek legend has it that [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill only to watch it roll back just before he got it to the top. For eternity. And that's how I feel right now.\n\nI am a non-techie ethereum noob, in case that isn't obvious. Downloaded Mist a few days ago, and have been running it since then, and the ethereum node has come within 70 blocks of syncing with Mist, and then just stops. Tried stopping and restarting countless times and the number of downloaded blocks keeps creeping up, but it never catches up with the blockchain total. \n\nI can't abandon it now, because I set up a wallet using Mist and transferred a smidgen of a Bitcoin to get it started, and that transaction shows up on Etherscan, but the wallet still shows 0.0 Ether, presumably because my Mist program has never synced?
