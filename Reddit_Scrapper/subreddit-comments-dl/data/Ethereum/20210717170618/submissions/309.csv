Very often, I have to look through hour long YouTube videos with 37 views to find answers to even basic questions about the language.\n\nIf anyone could point me to comprehensive databases of information, helpful books, YouTube channels etc.. It would be appreciated, yet it is frustrating that I haven't been able to find much on my own ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7urtbz/why_isnt_there_more_information_on_coding_with/,1,1

7usi1e,1517589300,Tool for generating transaction load on a private network?,"Hi r/ethereum,\n\nI'm currently looking for, and having trouble finding, a tool I can use to generate load on a private network. My private network is running in AWS and is using geth version 1.5. \n\nMy ideal setup would be a single instance orchestrating transaction load originating from nodes on the network. It would be able to define in some form (I'm not too picky on how exactly it's defined) a load to run, some set of instances to run it on, and a time period to run it for. The simplest use case might be to have each of 10 instances submit a transaction to send some fixed amount of ETH to a fixed contract every 30 seconds.\n\nAre there any tools out there that might help me do what I need to do or something close to it? Or is my only real option to write something from scratch?\n\nThanks in advance",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7usi1e/tool_for_generating_transaction_load_on_a_private/,2,0

It's been running for about a day and I noticed it quickly soaks up all my RAM and has crashed multiple times during sync.  Am I woefully under the requirements to run a full node?

7ut7st,1517594931,Ethereum adoption,"Hi, i would like to get some answers on this topic - however i am not even sure what to ask. I am interested in crypto, as freelancer coder i accept crypto payments. \n\nNobody ever offered me to pay in ethereum. I understand that ethereum is not just a payment protocol, its more a virtual machine, where people can run unstoppable codes.\n\nI have no idea why this is good, or what is the purpose or goal of this, and due to this, i was always thinking that ethereum is a scam.\n\nBut now i dont know what to think or what to believe. \n\nMeanwhile other coins are mined with asics by the whales, ethereum can be mined with a strong gpu (which i unfortunately dont have), and now the price is also rising and rising, the coin will possibly overtake bitcoin within a month. This must indicate that the market and usage of this coins are far bigger than i imagined it (i expected ethereum to die in 2017, of course i was wrong). \n\nSo basically, if i have a regular PC, is it safe to run an ethereum wallet? How much the full wallet will download and store on my computer, how long the blockchain sync will take? Can i use ethereum just as a payment method, like i used to do with the other coins? \n\nWill the people actually use it to pay for me, or this usage is not really popular in this community? \n\nI cant really put ethereum into context right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ut7st/ethereum_adoption/,15,24
