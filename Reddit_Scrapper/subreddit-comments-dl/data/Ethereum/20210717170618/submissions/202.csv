7o4kfy,1515087302,Idea - Unique identifier to avoid sending transactions to wrong/bad addresses,"I wanted some feedback on this idea.\n\n**Problem:** Sending Ethereum to exchanges/other addresses has a single point of failure (if I paste the wrong address my ETH is essentially gone).\n\n**Solution:** Have the receiving address generate a unique code to ""prepare"" itself for an incoming transaction.\n\n**Example:** I want to send my ETH to Bittrex. For this 1 instance, Bittrex would provide a receiving address AND a 6-digit code (ABC123). When I send my Ethereum, I provide the address and 6-digit code. If the 6-digit code I provided is not met with a matching 6-digit code, the ETH I sent is returned to my account.\n\nYou could also send ETH without the 6-digit code and transactions would behave as they do now. I feel this code strategy adds another layer of confidence (especially when sending large amounts of ETH). \n\nThoughts on this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7o4kfy/idea_unique_identifier_to_avoid_sending/,13,20
