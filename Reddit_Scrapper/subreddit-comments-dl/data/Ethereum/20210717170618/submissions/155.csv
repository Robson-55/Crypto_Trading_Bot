7l2zhv,1513791881,Who the ETH are you? Give yourself an alias DApp.,"Hi Everyone.\n\nI made a DApp that I want to share with you today.  Today if you want to be known you have two major options. You can be known by your address or go with the fancy fancy [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/).\n\nThose are both well and good, but how about something smaller and less fancy.  So I'm presenting to you...\n\n[Who the ETH are you?](http://www.whotheeth.com)\n\nOr, Who the ETH? or, WTE? For short.\n\nThis is a smart contract let's you pick a username/alias/any text you want for your address and let's any DApp look it up.  There are no restrictions to the name you use other than if you make one too big you might run into a gas problem :).  You can also change your name at anytime.  You can call yourself the same things others call themselves.  Who cares? I don't.\n\nSo, how do you do it?  [Check out our Fancy Website!](http://www.whotheeth.com)\n\nBut wait Moron, you say, it is probably not a free service.  You would be right, well, maybe, or not.  The first 500 people who set their name get to do it for free (well, you know, tx cost).  After that, it is just one finney to register.\n\nBut hey, this isn't just for you to give yourself a name. Let's say you have your own DApp and want usernames but don't want to have to figure it all out.  No sweat, I made a dev site that shows you how you can use Who The Eth? for your naming.  Also I show you a way that if you get users to sign up, you get the money, cause, I mean, that means you did the work. [Click here for the dev info.](http://www.whotheeth.com/dev.html)\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know here, I'll try to answer!\n\nOr if you would rather, [Check out my white paper!](http://www.whotheeth.com/white_paper.pdf)\n\nThank you for your time, hope to see some creative names in there, oh ya, it is UTF-8, so Emojis work, just saying.\n\n\nSide note, google DNS is messing up my site, if the link doesn't work [try using my backend site.](http://eth.prostarrealms.com)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7l2zhv/who_the_eth_are_you_give_yourself_an_alias_dapp/,19,17
