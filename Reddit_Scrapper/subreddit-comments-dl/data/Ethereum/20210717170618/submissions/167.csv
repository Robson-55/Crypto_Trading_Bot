7lrhwg,1514068153,"/u/cryptoassetmana have just lost $130,000 because of a well-known bug of ERC20 token standard that I'm fighting since 5 March, 2017. Let's sue.","## Intro\n\nRecently I was contacted by /u/cryptoassetmana who asked me to help to recover lost tokens. Unfortunately, it was a standard ERC20 scenario: /u/cryptoassetmana have just sent `SALT` token to the `ZRX-token-contract` address. This is the transaction: [etherscan link](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc328852d494117496c9d2e8148f8c1ae55316981f2e743c7039d43a18de9dcfe).\n\nHere is an address: [zrx contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x4156D3342D5c385a87D264F90653733592000581?a=0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498).\n\nAs I wrote millions times, tokens are lost, the user is suffering, no one is considered to be responsible, no one cares...\n\n#### I have recommended to submit a lawsuit against the SALT token developers. The problem is widely known and they are still using the code that is proven to be insecure and lead to loss of money exactly as I described.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBoth, ZRX (0xProject) and SALT (Salt loans) are ERC20 tokens. It is the responsibility of 0x team and SALT token developers.\n\nI suppose that they both knew about the problem of ERC20 standard that is guaranteed to result in money losses for customers and they are still using ERC20. \n\n- Saying that ERC20 is widely adopted and we don't care about anything else is irresponsible.\n\n- Saying ""It's not our problem if not our money is lost"" is irresponsible.\n\n- Saying ""Not a bug, user mistake"" is irresponsible.\n\nDefinitely, it's not a user mistake, but a flaw of the standard. Such an irresponsible approach to developing tokens is unacceptable if you are going to risk someone else's money.\n\nYou should research a bit about a token standard that you are going to use before you will risk millions of dollars of your customers. Moreover, I wrote about it a lot and I made everything to make this as public as possible.\n\n## Role of Ethereum Foundation\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation continues to promote the ERC20 token standard and an implementation that is proven to be unsafe since it is leading to loss of money.\n\nThere is a special section ""Issue your token"" at the front page of Ethereum: https://www.ethereum.org/\n\nIf you click the ""Issue your token"" button then a Minimal Viable Token code is shown and it's ERC20 token code. It is vulnerable to the described issue and it will lead to loss of money if used. I think that the code at the front page of Ethereum looks like an official recommendation or, at least, a secure code that you can use. But it definitely is not.\n\nI have requested to remove the code or replace it and opened a special issue for this: https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org/issues/755\n\nFeel free to comment this issue if you have something to say.\n\nPersonally, I think it's a bad idea to have an example of code that is guaranteed to lead to a loss of funds on the main Ethereum page.\n\nI'm publicly requesting to remove an insecure code example from the front page of Ethereum or replace it with any other code that will not lead to such a terrible consequences.\n\n## Full history of help requests and accident discussions\n\nYou can read more about this incident in many different subreddits:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/0xProject/comments/7lpc5n/ive_sent_my_tokens_to_the_zrx_smart_contract/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lpjxk/ive_sent_13631_salt_tokens_to_a_zrx_smart/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7lplwk/ive_accidentally_sent_130000_worth_of_salt_tokens/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SaltTrader/comments/7lqc6l/an_appeal_to_salt_token_developers_warning_you/\n\nI'll try to make this incident as public as possible.\n\nPlease, you can personally speak with /u/cryptoassetmana and ask about how it feels to lose $130,000 because of someone else's lazy coding and irresponsible development approach.\n\nI know many of you will say: ""Dex, you wrote million times about it. You are too alarmist, we all know about this, what else do you need?"" It's so easy to say when you are sitting and reading about someone else's abstract problems. \n\nI will recommend you to talk with real people who lost something because of irresponsible token developers that don't want to research and blindly trust widely adopted standards promoted by centralized authorities.\n\nI will recommend you to know how scared people are, how they think and what they feel in this situations. I will also recommend you to think about how much people are silently sitting and hate Ethereum for such accidents as Parity hack, all the millions of lost ERC20 tokens et cetera. It's all about someone's irresponsibility. It's not so scary unless the lost thouthands of dollars are your own.\n\n## ERC20 standard problems\n\nERC20 token standard suffers a critical issue that is constantly leading to a loss of money for token users. You can read more about ERC20 token standard critical problems [here](https://medium.com/@dexaran820/erc20-token-standard-critical-problems-3c10fd48657b) as always.\n\n## For those who are saying ""We don't need a new token standard, we can fix ERC20""\n\nThe problem of ERC20 token standard is lack of transaction handling mechanism of `transfer` function. \n\nYou can implement `transferAndCall`, `approveAndCall` or whatever else you want, but it will not fix the problem unless `transfer` stays. The only viable way to fix this is to get rid of the ability to send transactions in many ways. There need to be only one tansferring function (`transfer` or `send`) and it should work correctly with both addresses and contracts.\n\nFor those who are saying ""We have a check for `require(_to != address(this));` and it can save us from depositing our tokens into the token contract"":\n\nThe problem is lack of transaction handling mechanism. As you can see, SALT tokens were deposited into ZRX contract. The problem still stands and it doesn't matter if you add any more checks or not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lrhwg/ucryptoassetmana_have_just_lost_130000_because_of/,0,17
