7jtc6a,1513274569,"How can we ensure that the Parity client software project continues, and that the network and ecosystem won't become too dependent on a single implementation (geth)?","Having multiple independent implementations based on a common spec instead of just a single reference client that *is* the spec was always one of the strengths of Ethereum.\n\nThere are many other clients apart from just geth and parity, but they haven't gotten much use. Parity has always been an awesome client, and kept the network operational during some of last year's spam attacks for instance.\n\n\nI'm slightly worried that parity developers could get into so bad legal troubles that it hampers or completely terminates their ability or motivation to continue parity client development. Or maybe people won't trust their node software anymore either due to the multisig wallet thing, and everyone starts using geth.\n\nSo besides unfreezing the parity multi-sig funds in a HF, which I personally don't support and seems unlikely anyway, what can be done to save the parity node software project?

7ju1fn,1513280157,"As Ethereum prices in USD terms skyrocket, won’t network fees in terms of Ethereum have to come down?","I was just thinking to myself that Ethereum has doubled in price in a relatively short period of time. Therefore fees in USD terms have doubled (gas price and gas limits held constant but if anything gas price has gone up).\n\nIf the fees don’t come down in ether terms to remain somewhat constant in USD doesn’t that threaten to kill off Ethereum usage?  \n\nClearly people wouldn’t want to spend $20 on simple transactions that used to costs 20 cents.\n\nI know that for a change we could be a case of reducing gas prices to compensate, but then miners wouldn’t want to pick up the transactions right?  Miners work in terms of Ether but people doing things on the network will be likely to want to just hold their ether and not use if every little transaction costs a bunch in USD terms, right? And yes I’m thinking about the cats but not only.\n\nDoesn’t this fee issue provide downward pressure or at least stabilizing pressure on the price of Ethereum?\n\nPeople want to use the network to do stuff; this increases the price of ehtereum. Ethereum becomes so expensive that network fees are so high in USD terms people think fuck it, I don’t need to do that so badly, I’ll just save my ether, it’s valuable now.

7juj4y,1513284340,"Having trouble understanding how Proof of Stake works, can someone clarify?","**Proof of Work**\n \nTo start off, I think I have an ok understanding of Proof of Work. Miners use computing power to validate that proposed transactions are valid. They do this by generating random inputs that go into function until it spits out the correct value on the other end, verifying that the transaction is legit. They do this for a group of transactions (a block) and once the entire block is validated, it gets added to the end of the main blockchain and they get currency for their work.\n\nThat sort of thing makes sense to me because you're doing work to validate the transaction is real, but I'm struggling with Proof of Stake.\n\n**Proof of Stake**\n\nHere is how I hear Proof of Stake described: \n\nA person called a validator stakes some of their coin into the network. The validator then places a bet on a transaction they think is valid. If that transaction gets added to the blockchain, then they get a reward, a percentage of the transaction fee equivalent to the percentage of their initial stake. If that transaction turns out to be invalid, then they will lose some of their staked coins (I think this part is unique to Ethereum/Casper?).\n\nHopefully I've explained the basic concept correctly. If so, it leaves me with some additional questions.\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. How is a validator verifying a transaction is real? In other words, how do they know which one to ""bet"" on? In PoW it seems like transactions are being validated computationally, but that doesn't happen in PoS, correct?\n\n2. How likely is it that a validator will bet on a wrong (invalid) transaction? Could it accidentally happen or would it always be malicious? When you are talking about having to stake 1000+ ETH, that sounds like a huge risk.\n\n3. How do transactions get proven as invalid? If it's from other validators flagging them, what is the incentive for someone to prove that a validator is malicious? \n\n4. How many validators is Ethereum expecting? How many people have over 1000 ETH (if that's the minimum, for example)? Doesn't this just give a small amount of people enormous power?\n\nI know I'm probably butchering these questions, but hopefully they give you some insight into how I'm trying to understand PoS, and maybe someone can explain why that is incorrect.
