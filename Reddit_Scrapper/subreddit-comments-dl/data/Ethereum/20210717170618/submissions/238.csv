7pthgq,1515724344,"If I Create a ERC20 token that serves as a currency, then sell it for fiat, is that a taxable event?","For example, I create an ERC20 token called XYZ. This token can ONLY be used to buy goods and services from specific businesses that accept XYZ tokens as a form of payment. Sort of like arcade tokens can ONLY buy things like game play at the arcade machines of the respective establishment. They serve no other purpose outside of that establishment's ecosystem, just like XYZ tokens.\n\nNow, let's say I sell XYZ tokens for $1 USD each. Is this a taxable event? If so, what type? Is it capital gains, sales tax, etc? The same question applies to arcade tokens. Are the sale of those tokens for USD considered taxable? If so, under what category?\n\nI appreciate anyone taking the time to share their thoughts.

7ptv1f,1515728099,Etherscan?,"Does anyone know why etherscan has been down all day and when we might expect it back up?\n\nRelated question, in Evan's newsletter today there was this article from Jameson Lopp with some hard, and I think honest, feedback about infrastructure struggles with full Ethereum archive nodes, IOPS requirements etc. I think his smart contract concerns were probably overplayed, but in my own experience running few nodes I think the infrastructure part is probably pretty valid. Made me think services like Etherscan and Infura must have a devilish time keeping a fleet of archive nodes up and healthy all the time. Or if they don't, can someone from those teams (or anyone really) provide some pointers or advice to the concerns raised in that article? It can't be helpful if other folks trying to start businesses based on Ethereum encounter same struggles and no assistance from the community. \n\nAnd along those lines, I have not seen much discussion at all in this sub around scaling issues lately, or more specifically whether there are any short to medium term bandaids we can look forward to before we get to sharding and ubiquitous state channels. Even some upcoming performance improvements in geth, anything like that on the horizon? Is there some other forum where this might be getting discussed? \n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ptv1f/etherscan/,14,5

7pvvt7,1515754885,Use case of dapp for the general population/big corporations?,"From what I understand, essentially, dapp is a software that gets it's computational power from transactions. And the codes that run are highly secure.\n\nThis sounds really neat in theory, I'm having trouble imagining a dapp the average joe or large corporation would use over a traditional application. So far most of the dapps I've read about involves gambling or trading. Even the latest popular dapp cryptokitty seems like a form of gambling app. \n\nIt seems most day to day app like calander, games, twitter, photoshop, etc, have no reason to become a dapp counterpart. Why would consumer want a calander app where he/she must pay to schedule a new event? Why would developers make a game where triggering a boss level costs them money? Why would big corporations (e.g. google) pay money whenever they run an algorithm to generate ads for a user?\n\nIt just seems a software that costs hardware + electricity to run just makes more sense than a software that costs hardware + electricity + eth (or whatever token) to run. \n\nI'm pretty sure (correct me if I'm wrong) it's also much cheaper if someone (e.g. scientist) wanted computational power (e.g. protein folding) to rent servers or buy hardware outright than to get them by paying eth.\n\nI'm hoping there's a piece/s of information I'm completely missing as to why dapp has limitless possibilities and will be used more in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7pvvt7/use_case_of_dapp_for_the_general_populationbig/,11,3
