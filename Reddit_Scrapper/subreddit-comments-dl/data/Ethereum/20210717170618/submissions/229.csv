7pensq,1515578779,"Question about Proof of Stake research, testing &amp; deployment","I've asked this before but perhaps didn't make myself clear enough because all I got was 0 responses and 1 downvote :)\n\nI would like to better understand what PoS researchers mean when they say *testing* PoS protocols. Do they refer to simply testing that the code works as intended? Or to running the code on a test net to see how users interact with it?\n\nAs far as I understand, when it comes to mechanism design itself, decisions about incentives are made a priori and it will not be not until the protocol is in *full use on MainNet* that we get better idea of whether users behave as intended. And what I mean by *full use* is that there is large enough user base and enough money at stake for enough smart people to put enough work in trying to break the protocol. Which makes it all the more tricky.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and will be particularly grateful for pointers to relevant documentation published by the foundation (that I haven't read before).",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7pensq/question_about_proof_of_stake_research_testing/,13,11
