7q6t5p,1515873676,Lost all ethereum?!?!,"Hi. So I bought a new Ledger Nano S off of Amazon, and am using it today (I reset the device, and did a normal setup off of it).\n\nI then tried to take a fair amount of Eth off of an exchange that I was using. I did a test transaction first to the address that showed on my Chrome App off of coinbase ( a tiny amount), that went through quickly. Then I did the much bigger transaction off of the exchange, which has now shown it as ""Transaction Complete"", and now my exchange has a balance of 0.\n\nHowever, there is NOTHING in my wallet, if the Chrome App is to be believed. There is no record of this transaction on EtherScan either, and when I click ""Track transaction"" from the exchange it just says ""Sorry, we're unable to locate this transaction hash"".\n\nDid I just lose everything?! WTF?\n\nI have QUADRUPLE checked the addresses letter for letter. I did not enter the wrong address, and I did not mix up for another coin. I was withdrawing Ether into my Ether wallet..",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7q6t5p/lost_all_ethereum/,0,7
