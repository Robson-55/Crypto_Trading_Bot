7sobph,1516811938,Decentralized insurance registry idea,"I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how decentralized insurance could operate on Ethereum. The question I’ve been asking myself is what would insurance look like if we could rebuild the industry from the ground up?\n\nThe idea I’ve been thinking about is a sort of decentralized insurance services registry.\n\nEssentially this would be a registry of decentralized insurance fixtures or modules that would provide an insurance related service through a smart contract api. These modules could perform their service and receive immediate compensation through erc20 token transfer. For instance one module could provide KYC, and another could provide underwriting services, while another could provide liquidity pools. All of these modules could be built by different teams and companies and could be used ala carte by existing insurance systems as well as be combined together to form complex systems.\n\nInsurance is complicated and requires very specific set of functionality depending on the use case. Why not allow for very granular building of insurance systems in the decentralized web. Not only does this provide the ultimate transparency to consumers it also allows for teams to focus on doing one specific service well instead of trying to do everything. Projects and companies could compete on specific functionality and granular pricing. Decentralized insurance DAOs could then be created to provide end to end insurance solutions by utilizing these fixtures. Participants in these DAOs could then vote to choose which fixtures they want to use. \n\nDoes this idea make sense to anyone or is anyone else thinking of anything like this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7sobph/decentralized_insurance_registry_idea/,1,0

I'm wondering though what do you think the market will be in the future? Creating dApps? Smart Contracts?\n\nAlso, as someone who is not currently a developer, would I simply be beaten out by someone who has years as a programmer?

7soon8,1516814739,"Why does ETH have so much value? Anything that needs the Ethereum network to run can just use ETC, which costs 30x less.","Like Ethereum is valuable because it's a decentralized application platform, and DApps require ETH to pay for the gas/computation costs.  Now, ETC is the same exact thing. It can run the same apps, for 1/30th the cost (since ETC is $30 while ETH is $1000).
