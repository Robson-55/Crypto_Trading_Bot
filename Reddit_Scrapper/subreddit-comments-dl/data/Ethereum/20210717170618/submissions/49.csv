7ebz29,1511210421,"How will Ethereum development, adoption, and price respond to Net Neutrality reversal in the U.S.?","Some background, as I know we're not all U.S. residents:\n\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will outline new rules that will transfer power of regulating internet service providers from the FCC to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - a move that will reverse regulations that ensured Internet Service Providers (ISPs) would serve websites without bias. \n\nThe change is likely to pass as Trump appointed FCC chair, Ajit Pai, and two other Republicans control three of five votes on the new ruling. Amongst other things, the changes will allow ISPs to throttle access to some parts of the internet and provide 'fast lanes' for others.\n\nSome questions:\n\n- How will Ethereum development respond to this new, restrictive, environment?\n- How will blockchain development in general respond?\n- How will the changes impact Ethereum protocol adoption?\n- What will happen to the price?\n- Is the U.S. significant enough in this realm of globalized technology that restrictions as such can permanently cripple development/adoption/price?\n\n Bonus question! \n\n- How will InterPlanetary File Sharing (IPFS) react to the new rules?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ebz29/how_will_ethereum_development_adoption_and_price/,17,4

7ecg4c,1511214123,Ethereum scaling approach...?,"So I'm not an active Ethereum developer, so maybe this is already being done, or not for some specific reason.  Maybe this is even how ""sharding"" is supposed to work, I'm not sure.  But here's my thought...\n\nFor ages now we've had graphics/video compression technology that only stores complete images (keyframes) every so often, and the rest of the time only stores the changes that happened between the keyframes.  Obviously that usually results in MUCH less data to have to store, and therefore reduced file sizes (and image quality to an extent).\n\nCan the same essential concept be applied to scaling Ethereum?  Is it possible to only store ALL the transactions on a smaller number of nodes (Supernodes?  Masternodes?), and only record the new transactions over some fixed cycle, on the rest of the network the rest of the time?  That way after some sort of ""confidence interval"" has passed, the new transactions could cycle back over their old data again, safe in the knowledge that the Masternodes have securely recorded everything.\n\nAgain I'm no developer, just trying to apply something I'm more familiar with as a former video editor, and wondering how it could tie into helping Ethereum to scale.  Parts of what I've read about sharding already sound like this, but then others don't... so I'm not really clear on if this is being done, makes any sense at all, or is utterly inapplicable.\n\nThanks for reading...  =)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ecg4c/ethereum_scaling_approach/,0,6
