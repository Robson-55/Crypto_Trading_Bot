7wa0gf,1518140497,Erc20 tokens using plasma,"Hello Ethereum Experts,\n\nI have a question regarding second layer scaling solutions such as Plasma. \n\nFrom what i have read, Plasma is a side chain that allows erc20 tokens to essentially have their own blockchains. And currently, these erc20 tokens use the ethereum main chain to settle transactions.\n\nSo that brings me to my question:\n\nWill tokens be able to implement their own consensus algorithm such as mining/staking? \n\nFor instance, today's dapps have pre mined tokens; however, with plasma, will we be able to stake these tokens? And will this be how blocks are created on the child chain? \n\nOP out",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wa0gf/erc20_tokens_using_plasma/,9,10

7wa7yh,1518142523,A New Beginning: MyCrypto.com,"This is the condensed story of MyEtherWallet, and how we‚Äôve been lead down the path to MyCrypto. It‚Äôs cut down from [this longer story](https://medium.com/mycrypto/mycrypto-launch-6a066bf41093) so we can quickly tell you what you need to know.\n\nThere are some big changes happening in 2018 to ensure our longevity in the blockchain space. We will do our best to ensure everything happens smoothly and transparently. Thank you for your time.\n\nMyEtherWallet started with just two people. It was a simple interface that provided a simple solution to a problem: when Ethereum first launched, the only way to send your Ether was via command line.\n\n**A whole lot of stuff happened between the beginning and now, and that is all detailed in [Taylor‚Äôs massive statement üòâ](https://medium.com/mycrypto/mycrypto-launch-6a066bf41093).**\n\nAt the end of 2017, we saw the end of the side-project. 2018 will ensure we have a solid foundation for the product, the company, and the team. It is this solid foundation that ensures our long-term stability and success, in 2018 and beyond.\n\n### Which Leads To‚Ä¶\n\nMyEtherWallet LLC was sufficient for the early stages of growth. [MyCrypto](https://i.imgur.com/NPtZD4g.png) is designed with next-level scaling in mind from the beginning. The team assembled over the past 9 months and Taylor (me!) will now be building, providing support, educating, and ensuring the security of [https://mycrypto.com](https://www.mycrypto.com) and all future products.\n\nWe are confident this will contribute greatly to the entire ecosystem in the long-term.\n\nKvhnuke, remains in control of the MEW github repository, the MEW domain, and the AWS instances.\n\n### What This Means For You\n\nYou now have a choice between using MEW or [https://mycrypto.com](https://mycrypto.com). The team will be building and making improvements to https://mycrypto.com and the infrastructure behind it.\n\nWe will continue to do our best to help folks who have questions and need help, regardless of the product they are using, even if those products are not technically what the MyCrypto support box was designed for. Just as we have always attempted to answer questions and give guidance about specific tokens, other exchanges, other wallets, we will continue doing so for MEW.\n\nThe people who have helped you over the years via email or Twitter or Facebook or Skype or Slack or Reddit or Github will remain the same. However, these people will now be reachable via [https://support.mycrypto.com](https://support.mycrypto.com), support@mycrypto.com and the new social media platforms:\n\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/mycrypto\n\n* Medium: https://medium.com/@mycrypto\n\n* Github: https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ\n\n* Help &amp; Support: https://support.mycrypto.com\n\n* Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/MyCrypto\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MyCryptoHQ\n\n* Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/mycrypto\n\nThe new react &amp; typescript codebase has been audited. Pending a few minor updates, public beta testing will commence in the coming weeks. This codebase will eventually serve live to https://mycrypto.com. We aim to launch desktop apps and then mobile apps in the coming months.\n\nUntil we are confident in the stability &amp; usability of the new codebase, a forked version of the current version of MEW will continue to be maintained and improved on https://mycrypto.com.\n\nMyEtherWallet will continue to be online until it, for whatever reason, is not online. As we do for a number of products in this space, if we at any point determine the domain to be compromised, serving malicious code, or otherwise detrimental to the community, we will do what we can to warn the community and prevent use of that codebase and website. However, we wish the best for MyEtherWallet and hope it continues to be a viable product in this space.\n\nMost of all, we will continue to do what is best for the Ethereum &amp; blockchain community.\n\n---\n\nAs always, thank you for those who have supported us and those who continue to support us. We‚Äôve said it a million times, but we literally wouldn‚Äôt be here without you by our sides, helping us reach new heights and pushing us to be better. This is especially true today. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, good or bad, please share them with us in the comments here. If you‚Äôd like to talk to Taylor personally, she‚Äôll do her best to respond in a timely manner: tay@mycrypto.com.\n\nThank you.\n\nüíñ Taylor &amp; The MyCrypto Team\n\nPS: We have new stickers.

I've set up a private network on my computer for testing, with three different nodes. I can publish a contract on one, mine it, and use the contract from another node.  Likewise I can call sendTransaction() to send ether, mine it, and see the result on other nodes.  This is all with the geth command-line client on Linux.\n\nSample: eth.sendTransaction({from:eth.accounts[0], to:""0x3336a5df4c7a8a875110cbbef780109353f91588"", value:37777, gas:1e6});\n\nBut what I've found is that the mining has to happen on the node that called eth.sendTransaction(); mining on the other nodes does nothing to publish contracts or send ether.

Thank you!\n\nWondering who runs etherscamdb.info? Yeah you guessed it right:\n\n&gt; The database was created in 2017 by #TeamMEW when trying to find a solution to the ethereum scams. Of course grouping all the scams won't make them go away, but it will make identifying them and taking them down easier. It is now being maintained by the MyCrypto team.\n\nThis is not only shady in light of what's going on here, but would be seen as shady in the business world even if MEW and MyCrypto weren't coming from the same source/team. Thanks to /u/jokl66 \n\nEdit5: Quoting /u/kvhnuke who confirms again that the complete situation was unexpected.
