I will never use crypto wallets that run in my browser. \n\nI've read that you can use geth + ethereum wallet and use some command line options and then this works. But I don't even understand why I would need geth for this. And it seems to be broken from time to time (read multiple times that after an update there where problems). \n\nSo what is the recommended way to get a light wallet?
