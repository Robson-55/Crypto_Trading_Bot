7njo8z,1514862049,Anyone ever have ETH randomly show up in their wallet?,"I was out walking my dog tonight when I got an e-mail from Coinbase stating I had received some Ethereum (around $100 worth as of this writing). It came from a wallet that I have never sent to before (I usually use ETH as a way of funding my crypto-trading wallets on several marketplaces). The wallet is very active (534 transactions so far), sending to many different addresses. \n\nI just thought this was really strange...ever happen to anyone else? I mean, I'm not complaining here because I know there is virtually no way of anyone ever contacting me about it to ask for it back, so...free $100 as far as I'm concerned.\n\n**UPDATE** - Holding onto it for now. I'll decide what to do in a few days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7njo8z/anyone_ever_have_eth_randomly_show_up_in_their/,18,66
7njsnq,1514863422,"Had a 2 week gap between my last job and my new job so I made it a goal to learn iOS development and get an app published on the App Store, thus Coin Trade Alerts was born","**AFTER WORKING NON-STOP FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS I HAVE FINISHED THE NEW WEBSITE! THE WEBSITE OFFERS THE SAME FEATURES AS THE MOBILE APP (FOR ALL YOU NON IPHONE USERS!) AS WELL AS INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO SET UP THE ALERTS LOCALLY ON YOUR OWN MACHINE IF YOU DO NOT TRUST THE APP (WHICH I FULLY UNDERSTAND). ALL FUTURE UPDATES WILL FIRST BE DEPLOYED ON THE WEBSITE AND LATER THE IOS APP**\n\nhttp://cointradealerts.com\n\n**I want to make sure you all know from the start this is 100% free to use. There are no advertisements/monetization whatsoever. I built this because it's something that I've been using for a few months and thought that I could strengthen my personal skill set and build out for others to enjoy.**\n\nhttp://cointradealerts.com/\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coin-trade-alerts/id1329306758?ls=1&amp;mt=8\n\nIt's a pretty simple app really. You create a view only API key, plug it into the app, add your phone number, and then you never have to open the app again. It will send you a text message when your orders fill. (It will work for all GDAX products)\n\nHere's exactly how it works:\n\n1) Generate **view only** API key (this allows the app to read your completed orders).\n\n2) Provide your phone number/carrier (so I can build your contact email i.e 123456790@txt.att.net)\n\n3) The app will make a request every 60 seconds and record the number of completed orders you have in a database. Every time it checks, it will see if there's a difference in the numbers. If there is, it will build a message with information from that many of your most recent fills (something like buy: X TICKER at $Y total: $Z)\n\nI originally wrote most of the backend Python of this a few months ago and I've been running it on my Raspberry PI and sending me a text when my limit orders fill. The main reason why I wrote this is because I thought it was something crucial that other services didn't offer, and being a Software Engineer I could do quite easily. A bunch of my coworkers who were also into trading cryptocurrency on GDAX really wanted to use it so initially I was just giving them the code but then I decided that since i've always wanted to have an app under my name on the App Store and learn Swift, this would be the perfect opportunity.\n\nI have all of the code publicly visible on my Github [HERE!](https://github.com/leggio/CoinTradeAlerts) The backend API is a flask web server running on an AWS EC2 Instance. The Database is an AWS RDS MySQL database. I've been using Flask for about 2 years and I never really thought that it could be practical for iOS development. It really surprised me how well it worked.\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nAlthough my code is publicly visible and I am only reading your completed orders, there is obviously a trust level required on your end to give me the API key. Nobody here knows who I am and I fully understand that!\n\n**If you provide anything more than VIEW ONLY your API key CAN be used to transfer your money/coins and steal them.**\n\nIf anyone does not feel comfortable doing so, you are more than welcome to use [the previous version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leggio/Cryptocurrency/master/Fill_Tracker.py) of this code and run it locally on your machine. This means that you are entering your API credentials locally on your own machine.\n\nI am in the process of building out the website, which will include instructions as to how to do the above, as well as provide the same (and more!) functionality that the app does. The website should come out with the base features in a few days and will allow people who don't have iPhones to utilize this tool!\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n**I originally posted about this on /r/litecoin and /r/bitcoin yesterday and received such overwhelming support that it was crashing the backend web server of my application. Today I was able to get this sorted out and nobody should experience any problems!**\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAdditionally, I received a lot of great feedback from you guys, which is why I spent quite a few hours yesterday/today building a brand new website that will offer the exact same functionality as the mobile app, but in your browser! I plan on deploying in the days to come. I will be adding all user requests to the website as well.\n\nWhat's currently on my todo list: 1) Security alerts! I had a phenomenal request from /u//swingvitamin to set up alerts when transfers/instant purchases are made on your account to try and combat account theft. I think this was an awesome idea and I will be working to bring this out ASAP!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7njsnq/had_a_2_week_gap_between_my_last_job_and_my_new/,745,91
