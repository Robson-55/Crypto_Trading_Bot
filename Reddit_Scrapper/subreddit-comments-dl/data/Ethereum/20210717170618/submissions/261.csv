7rblie,1516298740,Hello guys! Can someone explain this in lame mans terms,"So i tried to transfer tokens from an exchange... Nothing ever showed up! It still says txid: Not found... But the exchange has a press release. I have done some research on it, Can a more experienced Ethereum holder explain this to me in lay-mans terms!?\n\n""the withdrawal manner of ETH is processed by a regular transferring address, due to the difference between ETH and transferring method base on the encrypted coin from the mode of utxo. The intensive roll in and roll out activities of ETH base on a single address which may require sequential transferring in order to complete the process, however, the processing performance has been majorly degraded. The congestion of network may enable a more massive detention of sequence even from a single ETH transferring activity, even unable to be collected by the miner when there’s a situation of transferring overtime. We are currently focusing on the transferring from single address to multiple addresses which may under certain degree relief the issue of token transferring detention of erc20 and ETH. The upgrade may take a few business days.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7rblie/hello_guys_can_someone_explain_this_in_lame_mans/,3,12

This was right when the network was under heavy load and the gas price went up, so I know why it didnt go through. I have two issues:\n\n1. At the time I didn't understand why so I created another transaction and now I have 2 sitting incomplete which totals more then what I actually have in the wallet. When I check etherscan.io they pop in and out and show pending. How do I cancel these?\n\n2. How do I transfer in the future? I know I can check the gas prices and come up with the actual price I should use but the program only allows me to change the amount of gas to use.
