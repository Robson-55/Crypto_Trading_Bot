7riox6,1516372547,Proof of Stake testing,"I've asked this question before (https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7pensq/question_about_proof_of_stake_research_testing/) but haven't got any satisfactory answers so I thought I'd rephrase it again and ask again :)\n\nAs far as I understand, when it comes to *mechanism design itself*, decisions about incentives are made a priori and it will not be not until the protocol is in **full use on the main net** that we get better idea of whether users behave as intended. And what I mean by **full use** is that there is large enough user base and enough money at stake for enough smart people to put enough work in trying to break the protocol. Which makes it all the more tricky.\n\nIn other words, there are many *hyperparameters* about the protocol (the exact slashing conditions, consensus rules, etc.) that have to be tuned for the Proof of Stake system to meet its *objectives* (minimise voting on parallel chains, minimise time to confirmation, incentivise validator participation, etc.). Is there any testing being done beforehand in order to fine-tune those *hyperparameters*? (Once again, doing that on a test net is only relevant to a limited extent because *test net* is a vastly different environment from *main net in full use*)\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and will be particularly grateful for pointers to relevant documentation published by the foundation (that I haven't read before).\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7riox6/proof_of_stake_testing/,3,5

7rkgob,1516387189,"Introducing the Ether Whuffie, a Sybil-resistant reputation system for Ethereum.","You can view the contract on etherscan here:  https://etherscan.io/address/0x90da942f5a63b383121cd8d4772d384cd7ed51eb#code\n\nThe code is here:  https://github.com/ldurback/EtherWhufffieManager/\n\nAn ugly mock up of the user interface that needs improvement can be found here:  https://ldurback.github.io/EtherWhufffieManager/\n\n---\n\nThe Ether Whuffie is a (positive or negative) reputation token that can be purchased for others (with ether) but not transferred.  The ether used to purchase a whuffie is locked in the contract and cannot be removed (it is essentially burned).\n\nSince the ether is burned, the whuffie system is Sybil resistant.  A person who gives himself positive reputation to himself will lose money, so he cannot upvote himself indefinitely.  The whuffie, however, is not Sybil-proof.  A person can still buy his own reputation.  However, the contract I wrote logs an event on the blockchain whenever a (positive or negative) whuffie is sent, so a good front end for the contract can analyze who sent whuffies to whom and can censor whuffies that a person appears to send to himself.  Therefore, by having a good front end for the whuffie, we can make the system fairly Sybil resistant.\n\nAdditionally, when you send a (positive/negative) whuffie, you can log a message along with the whuffie purchase, which allows additional feedback on the user the whuffie is purchased for.  (Viewing these messages is not implemented in the mockup of the user interface)\n\nClosing notes:  IMO, this reputation system is not perfect since it's not Sybil-proof.  However, I think it's better than nothing.  Additionally, this same method could work for adding a reputation system to any other coin/token.  I personally think that a Dai-Whuffie (a whuffie denominated in Dai) would be more useful than the Ether-Whuffie due to the volatility of the ether.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7rkgob/introducing_the_ether_whuffie_a_sybilresistant/,8,17
