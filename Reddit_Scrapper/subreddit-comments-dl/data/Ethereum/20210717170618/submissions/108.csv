Since I was new and not knowing what the hell I was doing, I came across Xeth wallet. I put them in there. Fast forward to now, they're stuck in there because this DUMBASS WALLET DOESN'T SYNC WORTH A DAMN. Once it syncs, then I can hopefully get them out. If anyone is familiar with this hunk of junk wallet and can help me or knows how to get it to sync with the blockchain, I'd be more than grateful for the help and I will send you some eth in return for the help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7iey2i/xeth_wallet_sync_issues_will_reward_eth_for_help/,0,1

7if57y,1512741850,Is anyone running a Parity 'archive' node?,"I've been running Parity with this command line `parity --tracing on --pruning archive` for more than a year. Yes, I know it's nuts, but I have my reasons. Is anyone else doing this? Since the Byzantium fork the data size has grown from around 330 GB to over 450 GB. But worse, Parity seems to explode it's disc usage about three times a day to over 1 TB. My hard drive is 1TB, so Parity crashes. If I restart Parity, the data usage goes back to 450 GB, but then it re-explodes about two hours later.\n\nAm I alone? Is anyone else seeing this? Does anyone have a solution? I tried running Parity by storing its data on an external 2TB drive, but there are syncing problems with that for some reason.\n\nAny help or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7if57y/is_anyone_running_a_parity_archive_node/,5,11

I know Eth is going to go up in value eventually, but I'm done with it, I have more important things to do because there has to be a network architecture or system that is Anonymous, Secure, Robust, Resilient, and which one can build a better session or application layer on.\n\nBut related to the title, seriously Geth, 42GB?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ig860/how_eth_got_me_50gb_of_space_back/,0,1
