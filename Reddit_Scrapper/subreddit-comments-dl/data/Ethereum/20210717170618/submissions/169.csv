Read a bunch of stuff and decided to go with Ether.  \n  I set up my coinbasse account transferred my first test Euro, it took quite a while (6 days) to deposit, so once it showed up in my wallet, I did another test. Waiting for the Euro for 10 days now.  So Coinbase is not for me.  \n  I looked at Kraken, they seem to be US only as well as Gemini.  \n  Which exchange do you suggest that is at least functional and works with a EU bank account?  \n  \n  Cheers and happy holidays!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lu89g/new_to_this_as_coinbase_does_not_really_seem_to/,2,16
