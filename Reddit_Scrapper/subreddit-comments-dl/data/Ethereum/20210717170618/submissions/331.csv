7wgnds,1518210615,Official MyEtherWallet Statement,"Official Statement Regarding yesterdays' events and status of [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com)\n\nHello Everyone,\n\nBy now, you may have already read the article at [medium](https://medium.com/mycrypto/mycrypto-launch-6a066bf41093). For those of you who do not know me, I founded MyEtherWallet (‚ÄúMEW‚Äù), and I believe that I owe our Ethereum community, and the crypto community at large, an explanation of yesterday‚Äôs events.\n\n\nBefore I do, a brief history about me: I‚Äôve been intrigued by Ethereum ever since the release of their yellow paper back in 2014. Upon reading it, I realized that Vitalik was a true visionary and became infatuated with the technology behind Ethereum. Specifically, I understood all the transformative possibilities that this type of technology presented now and in the future. When the Ethereum Foundation released the ‚ÄúMainnet,‚Äù however, I recognized that many users were struggling. With no graphical user interface, many early adopters were having difficulty accessing and transferring their Ether. I saw an opportunity to contribute to this new, emerging community, and seized it. \n\n \n\nI began working on a user interface to be used in conjunction with, and in support of, Ethereum wallet functionality that any new crypto adopter could feel comfortable using. I released my initial version, and published it on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3gkknd/ether_wallet_generator_for_now/) on August 11, 2015 (MEW‚Äôs birthday!). I designed it to be open source so that others like me could make modifications to my existing codebase, and continue improving user-friendliness and functionality over time.\n\n\n\nHowever, as a core developer and programmer, business development/designing were, admittedly, not my strength. I needed someone to take the lead on that front if I wanted MEW to grow its userbase. I brought my friend, Taylor M., on board knowing that she was up to the task. Let‚Äôs just say that she did not disappoint, and MEW took off much faster than either of us could have anticipated. I will always be appreciative of her efforts in helping MEW achieve the success it did.\n\n\n\nAlas, for reasons I cannot delve into here, our partnership had to end. During the transition yesterday, however, MEW‚Äôs Twitter account was switched from @myetherwallet to @mycrypto, and tens of thousands of MEW followers were left scratching their heads. Indeed, the change was unexpected, and I‚Äôm still in the process of determining the justification behind the switch, and how this issue will be resolved. I don‚Äôt know what the fall out from this will be ultimately, but I will not be on the offensive or defensive discussing the circumstances surrounding our decision to separate beyond my statement here.\n\n\n\nInstead, my focus will be (as it‚Äôs always been) on how best to improve MEW for existing and prospective users. Security is paramount these days, and me and my new team will remain vigilant in ensuring that the MEW website, your accounts, and more importantly, your ether and tokens, are safe. Rest-assured that MEW is the same product that you trusted yesterday, and the MEW team will work tirelessly to make sure it is the product you still trust tomorrow. The Ethereum community inspired me to create MyEtherWallet, and it still inspires me today. I am not going anywhere. Furthermore, for those of you wondering where I‚Äôve been or what I‚Äôve been working on the past several months, I‚Äôve been busy doing what I do best‚Äîso get ready for some new and exciting products/services in the pipeline. Stay tuned!\n\n\n\nIn any event, I must admit that competition is a good thing because it serves as a driving force behind innovation. Look at the world around us. Complacency simply means one will get left behind. That being said, I sincerely wish Taylor M. and MyCrypto the very best. Your presence in the crypto space will undoubtedly motivate me to continue raising the bar.\n\n\n\nThank you all for your support over the last few years, and hopefully, in the years to come. MEW‚Äôs team remains committed to you, and is available to answer any and all questions or concerns you may have. \n\n\n\nTruly yours,  \nKosala H.  \nkvhnuke",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wgnds/official_myetherwallet_statement/,1453,840

7whq5f,1518220348,Roman Mandeleil attended BIP001 recently? (ether.camp / HackerGold Updates),"Usually i'm not the one to try and dig up old mysteries in the crypto space, but ether.camp and Roman Mandeleil's sudden disappearance have come to question once again.\n\nI remember reading that he has/had some serious health problems and that was the reason for the sudden silence, which would be totally understandable and I have accepted that.. until now.\n\n[Roman popped up on my Facebook feed](https://imgur.com/a/9JuKq) (after not posting since March 2017), with a photo of him speaking at the BIP001 conference in Ukraine. The fact that there has been such silence from him / ether.camp within the Ethereum community and yet he is attending and speaking at crypto-related conferences brings to question - What the hell actually happened and how is he still active in the broader crypto space whilst remaining totally silent within the Ethereum community?\n\nI first met Roman at Devcon1 and left with a pretty decent opinion of him. I just find it so strange that such a person can continue radio silence for so long and yet still be physically involved in the crypto space. As you may have guessed, I do have contact with him via Facebook but I am hesitant to attempt to open communication, since he does not appear to want to communicate.\n\nHave any other developments regarding ether.camp or Roman been revealed that I have somehow missed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7whq5f/roman_mandeleil_attended_bip001_recently/,9,4
