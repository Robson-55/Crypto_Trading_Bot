We charge only $10 for all transactions. \nHow bitcoin accelerator works? \nWe push your transactions to multiple pools we are working with and even if you pay 0.01$ fees, you still have the chance to get the transaction confirmed through our accelerator service immediately. \nRefund? \nIf your transaction is not confirmed after 10 minutes, we will provide you with a full refund within a day. This policy is not applicable to the tx which are removed or double-spent during the acceleration process. \nConfirmation time? \nIf your tx has 0 or 0.01$ fees it can take upto 30-60 Minutes while fees above 0.50$ will be confirmed within 10 minutes.

When a miner creates a block, it also creates the “witness” block for it, which contains all the information (and their Merkle proofs) that is required for processing all the transactions in that block, and computing the next state root. This means that nodes do not need to access storage from files, and block validation times should drop significantly. Then, the gas limit can be raised to much higher number.\n\n\nI find this to be worth sharing and if validated then implemented immediately.

7iqsav,1512867682,Easing the Network Congestion - Cutting Gas Costs in Three,"With the recent network congestion as a result of the crypto kitties craze, I've been working on something that could significantly ease the current issues. The idea is to facilitate ether and token transfers by moving the signatures and verification off chain. This can result in significantly reduced gas consumption for these transfers and thus cheaper transfers and more of them per second. There is a downside however which is that you must trust the owner of the contract not to swipe your ether, putting them in their account(s). The good news is that this fraud can be easily detected but there still remains a significant security risk so I would recommend that you deposit only small amounts for now. However this system is ideal for tipping others and other micro payments. I plan to make splitting the check, supporting your favourite digital content, and other such daily activities easier and better for all involved. My hope is that this can facilitate the development of ethereum and help bring it further into the public spotlight where it belongs.
