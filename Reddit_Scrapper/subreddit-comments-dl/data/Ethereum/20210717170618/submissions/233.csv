7pkuab,1515637052,How does Plasma compress state using UTXO representation and merkle proofs?,"I have been reading https://plasma.io/plasma.pdf as well as https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-viable-plasma/426, and I am not sure I understand exactly how the UTXO representation and merkle proofs submitted to the parent blockchain are able to compress the child blockchain state so much.\n\nBased on my understanding, on the child chain, signed transactions are exchanged and every so often validators nodes will publish a block of transactions. They will optionally write the merkle root of the block to the parent (Ethereum) blockchain. The child chain state is represented by a bitmap of UTXOs(?).\n\nSo when a withdrawal of a UTXO is initiated, what specifically does its merkle proof consist of? I am guessing the merkle root of all transactions leading to that particular output (as arranged into a tree), but it's unclear to me from the resources I have found. If so, I'm confused as to why the block merkle proofs ever need to be written to the parent since by themselves they don't lend to updating the plasma contract ledger state.\n\nRepresenting UTXOs with a bitmap seems to imply that some bookkeeping (i.e. bit allocation and collection) is required. How do participants in the child chain agree on which bit a UTXO corresponds to? Is there some special scheme which makes it so that the overhead of allocation and collection doesn't exceed the space it would cost to just store the UTXOs in the first place?\n\nI appreciate in advance any insight which can be brought to bear on these questions!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7pkuab/how_does_plasma_compress_state_using_utxo/,20,23

However, I've never been able to motivate myself to create something with Solidity as the learning curve was rather steep. \n\nAbout a month ago, I switched my major to Computer Science and have been trying to find interesting areas to help build my skills in. As a result, I made a resolution this year to try and learn Solidity programming. I'm really proud to present my first Ethereum DApp, and I think I've gotten a pretty good grasp on the basics of how it works. The source code is [here](https://github.com/njaladan/Etherball/).\n\nI haven't deployed it to the mainnet yet due to high gas prices and me just being a student without enough ether. However, the testnet versions are still fully functional, and it would mean a lot if you could look it and perhaps give some feedback!\n\nhttps://lottery.now.sh/",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7plcw5/i_built_a_lottery_dapp_for_my_new_years/,47,26
