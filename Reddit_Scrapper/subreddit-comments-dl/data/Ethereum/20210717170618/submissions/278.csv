If there is demand for this I would be happy to create a tutorial using myetherwallet.com\n\nOther people might not find this as exciting as I do, but so cool that we can now trustlessly exchange tokens in such a simple way.

But I tinker with different protocols/projects built on top of Ethereum and _generally_ noticed that docs are fragmented/not that great for Smart Contracts.\n\nI was thinking of creating a Documentation generation tool leveraging [Contract ABIs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI) and adding it that as a feature within ReadMe. It would have all of ReadMe’s existing features but with a Smart Contract Explorer instead of the Existing API Explorer feature we have.\n\nWhen I say “Smart Contract Explorer” I mean that it gives you the ability to make calls right within the docs. Basically, it would be a more fancy version of this: https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#readContract\n\nHere’s a screenshot of what the API Explorer currently looks like inside ReadMe: https://cl.ly/430n1a1I0n45\n\nIf you can imagine the “Try It” button firing off a transaction to Ropsten or just reading from the blockchain to give the developer an idea of how that particular function works.\n\nJust wanted get some thoughts on this before building it.\n\n**Do you think something like this would be helpful for Devs in the ecosystem? Why or why not?**\n\n**Are there any features you’d like to see?**\n\nThanks for reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7sktfi/can_i_get_your_thoughts_on_a_ethereumrelated_dev/,7,4
