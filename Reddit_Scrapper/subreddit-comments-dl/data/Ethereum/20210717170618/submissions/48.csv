7e8n5e,1511182267,"Formatted disk, recovered keystore folder","So, I find myself in this classic situation: Windows crashed and I reinstalled it.\n\nA few days later, while being alone in my room I groan with a tear in my eye and facepalm so hard I still have an impression in my forehead. I forgot my wallet file - and all my backups are god knows where. The piece of paper I wrote down my address on wasn‚Äôt my private address. I contemplate how stupid I am and conclude that I am quite stupid.\n\nSo, with 120gig of damage done on the disk, I install a file recovery program and I am able to recover both the keystore folder and all the block chain info from /AppData/ethereum/geth/.\n\nFrom here on out I am at a loss; myetherwallet won‚Äôt run the files I found in the /keystore/-folder. It was two files in there, which I thought was weird.\nI am suspecting the reason it won‚Äôt run is because it has become corrupted in some way.\n\nIs there any way of ‚Äútesting‚Äù the integrity of the .json-files?\n\nWill it work if I download Geth or similar and copy the data into the new appdata folder?\n\nAm I eternally screwed or do I have a chance now that I‚Äôve recovered the files?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7e8n5e/formatted_disk_recovered_keystore_folder/,4,12

Businesses would set lures up to attract people there, and those people might buy something while they are there.\n\nSimilar concept. You use your ETH to place an envelope at that business. You also place a 20% off coupon inside the envelope. Users see the envelope on their GPS and obviously want free stuff, so head to the location, open it, and see a discount for idk... coffee. Why not grab a coffee!\n\nApp details here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lomocoin.lomocoin\n\nIf you believe I should move this post to ethtrader instead, or somewhere else, or you just don't care, please let me know i'll gladly adjust!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7eack2/eth_added_to_the_lomostar_app/,25,0
