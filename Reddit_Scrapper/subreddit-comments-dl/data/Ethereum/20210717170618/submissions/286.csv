They can then use this currency to 'buy' virtual features, or they can risk the currency in a contest of sorts against other users.  The winner(s) of the contest will be rewarded with the bulk of the entry fees that all contestants risked.  \n\nIf the project is successful, users will be able to cash out any virtual currency that they have earned for real money.\n\nI have been reading up on Ethereum and am very fascinated with the technology and possibilities.
