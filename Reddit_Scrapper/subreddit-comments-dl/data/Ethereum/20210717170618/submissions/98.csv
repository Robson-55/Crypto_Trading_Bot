7hygb5,1512571341,"Thought on Crypto Kitties ""Issue""","So this is a game where users spend money (Ether) right? Assuming the players likely do not have infinite ether, at some point they will not be able to transact due to a lack of said ether. In which case they will either buy more or stop playing Crypto Kitties.\n  \nSay they decide to buy more ether then. If I was to spend $100 on digital cats I'd like to see a ROI for them, so I won't buy more ether until that happens. If players stop playing in this case it seems to me that this ""issue"" will slowly die off.\n  \nThe same can be said for those who continually buy more ether or spend a significant amount of ether on the site as eventually they'll realize ""gee it seems I've spent more than I've earned... that's not good"". There are also gambling personalities out there, but I think its safe to assume they are not the majority.\n  \nSure other ""Crypto Kitties"" clones could come along and do the same thing, but you'd have the same end result as well... players can only spend so much before they need more ether and or they have that previously mentioned realization. I'd also argue this would be kind of a good thing as you'd have competition for which crypto *&lt;insert animal name here&gt;* contract has cheaper fees and thus the potential for higher profits.\n  \nScaling solutions should be developed of course... but do we need one RIGHT NOW because a few furry bois are spending all their ether? I don't think so. Personally my plan is just to wait it out; in my opinion these players will eventually notice their losses and stop.\n  \nThoughts? :)\n  \n****\n  \nEDIT: Recurring comment and answer I should have included above:\n  \n*Players buy cats from each other; people buy cats and turn around to sell them then use the sale profit to buy another cat.*\n  \nYou cannot sell without a buyer. Right now everyone wants to buy a cat, but ideally you want cats with certain traits as they are generally worth more (ie: gold fur, etc.). So some cats will be valued more than others and not everyone is going to be able to sell their cat for the price they want. Really what the developers have done is taken a token which is valued with other tokens as a whole and made the token instead be valued by its own traits.

7hyh2c,1512571542,A suggestion to help network congestion using wallet UIs.,"While suggestions start to fly around much more technical solutions when it comes to scalability, I think there solution on the wallet UI side staring us right in the face that could help with network bloat.\n\nThis suggestion stems around the idea of most users do not fully understanding the gas market and how it creates a queue of pending transactions. The result of this is we get a lot of spam duplicate transactions.\n\nIf you're new to Ethereum or not very technical, you're most likely just going to create a transaction and then use the defaults set by the wallet you're using to send it.  In times of high network use, this is most likely going to create a transaction which is stuck in the queue for a little while.  Now take that same person who doesn't know why their transaction isn't going through right away and they are going to just keep repeating it over and over, thinking something went wrong.\n\nI suggest the following for all major Ethereum wallets.  A UX standard that implements at a minimum:\n\n1. Interaction with data similar to what [Eth Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info/) provides that shows a matrix of fees currently on the network and what the expected wait times are.\n2. The ability to cancel a stuck transaction easily using the nonce technique outlined [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/72tctz/guide_how_to_cancel_a_pending_transaction/). \n3. The ability to change the gas price on a transaction easily using the nonce technique outlined [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/72tctz/guide_how_to_cancel_a_pending_transaction/).\n4.  A standard implementation of how a fee payment looks in the UI.  Currently Mist, Parity, and MetaMask all use different ways of going about that.  Ideally this would be tied in with #1 and in that case I think the Parity's style of UI would fit best.
