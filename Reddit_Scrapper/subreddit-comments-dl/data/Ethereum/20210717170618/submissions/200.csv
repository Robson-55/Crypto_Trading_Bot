Has anyone started working on a tool that might be able to run this type of analysis?

Perfect way to get involved and build my development skills. Not trying to re-invent the wheel though so please do shout if you know of anything already in the works.\n\nAlso, I am not referring to a tool like bitcoin.tax, because as far as I know it only works with tabular transaction history (like CSVs). I know it has a manual option too. No, I'm looking for something that says ""Okay this address started with this much money and performed such and such transactions, held these smart contract assets, and made this much money.""\n\nAlso, inb4 nice try IRS.
