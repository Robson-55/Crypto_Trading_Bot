Everything has been going well until i noticed one address was receiving ETH to their address and then trying to purchase one of my ERC20 tokens multiple times but kept getting rejected because they were not using gas. But only after this address received ETH. Is this some kind of spam attack or maybe they are trying to glitch my address somehow?  Any insight will help thank you kindly.

I've gone over it a half dozen times to make sure it's correct. I've tried it with the 0X prefix and without. I don't see what I could be doing wrong.\n\nThe wallet was never synced with the network, but that's only because it's literally impossible to sync it on anything but an SSD. It never fucking catches up with the blockchain otherwise. Is that what's holding me up?

7w23mh,1518061897,Can Sharding and Casper scale if there are no hardware and bandwidth requirements?,"I like Proof of Stake in principal because it prevents powerful/expensive hardware from gaining an unfair competitive advantage and lockout willing stakers from participating in the system. However, wouldn't this potentially create a bottleneck on the platform? \n\nA staker with 1000 ETH can earn more nominal returns than a smaller staker with 1 ETH while providing the exact same amount of resources to keep the system running.  \n\nIs the idea that running more nodes will increase the chances of someone being chosen as a validator which means that the person with a lot of ETH is incentivized to run as many nodes as it can to maximize returns while contributing more power to the system? \n\nAdditionally with hardware getting faster and cheaper each year, wouldn't it prevent the system from scaling by not having a minimum requirement on hardware which gradually increase with time?\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7w23mh/can_sharding_and_casper_scale_if_there_are_no/,6,6
