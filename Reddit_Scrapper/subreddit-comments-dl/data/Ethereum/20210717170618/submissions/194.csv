7nobfc,1514918158,Empirical verification of Casper blocks?,"In PoW, it is easy to verify the work that went into mining the block - Bitcoin blocks begin with a certain number of leading zeros and Ethereum blocks satisfy a set of conditions defined in the yellow paper.\n\nThis serves an important purpose of giving each block a level of empirical trustworthiness. Namely that some actor spent a lot of work producing it. Although this in and of itself does not give a verifier total confidence of the chain state, it does prevent cheap MIM attacks of data providers handing faulty blocks to light clients.\n\nBut what about Casper? Is there an analog that would give empirical confidence that the data provided to a light client is canonically true (or at least that some sufficient stake went into making it)? If not, has this been discussed? It seems like a huge attack vector that would prevent many forms of scalability. This is not a problem constrained to light clients. Many avenues of scalability require interfaces to the mainnet and the data passed from the mainnet must be provably false to remain a trustless interface.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7nobfc/empirical_verification_of_casper_blocks/,4,4
