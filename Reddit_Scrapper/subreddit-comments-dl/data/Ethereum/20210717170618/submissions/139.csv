7k4vy5,1513396367,We desperately need more --lightserve nodes !!!!!!!,"Ethereum Wallet has this great feature called sync with ligh client network. This gives you a functional working program (so no webbrowser needed) that can interact with the Ethereum network, while only downloading about 1 GB of data. This is ESSENTIAL for most people on this planet, as they don't have very fancy and expensive hardware. However recently there have been bugs in the latest version of geth leading to a very unstable light mode network. There are not enough peers available to serve everybody and this leads to possible new peers never getting connected, if they would they would be able to help other light mode users. So the light mode network is getting starved. Please developers, fix the bugs that lead to bad connectivity. And users here,  you can help by running a Ethereum Wallet in light mode so there will be more light nodes available. Also Parity developers please make a light mode version for your wallet that is compatible so that users from both wallets can get connected to each other. \n\nThere is such great opportunity for Ethereum to actually get the user adoption that Bitcoin sold out on. The community is alive, the developers are united, the network is stable, transactions are fast and cheap.\n\nSo please fix these bugs and let's get that light mode network working properly it will help people like me that might not currently have the resources to store 20 GB of data but are smart enough they want to interact with the Ethereum network without having to use a webbrowser. (always keep business and pleasure separated) \n\nI want to user Ethereum more and more for payments but right now when I go online, I have to leave my laptop connected to the internet for about 20 hours just to get enough connectivity with other light mode peers to download a couple 100 MB of extra block headers. And because of a bug sometimes the lighchain get corrupted and it can take 30 - 40 hours for me to get 1 GB of lightchain data, while if I download something over bittorrent at 500 kb/s it only takes 33 minutes to download 1 GB.\n\nWe need more lighserve nodes!!!!!! The demand is currently very very high. \n\nedit: So the problem is that the latest protocol update has made peer discovery less reliable, and this hits harder in lightmode because there are less lightserve nodes, probablly because the lightserve  option is off by default when you run geth (because lightmode is still experimental). On github I have seen people advise to run geth 1.7.2 instead of 1.7.3 but I can't confirm for myself it that is a good fix. On Linux, after geth is running, you can launch Ethereum Wallet and it will see geth is running. If you just launch Ethereum Wallet I think it opens it internally or something and since the last update I  think it is using geth 1.7.3.   \n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k4vy5/we_desperately_need_more_lightserve_nodes/,332,150

I have been using a VPN for quite some time so that every site I visit doesn't know who I am. I know that my information is accessible to the VPN service I chose, and this flaw has led me to believe that Mysterium (decentralized vpn) is a very good idea.\n\nFirst I want to know how realistic the Mysterium Project is, and if there are any major pitfalls that will make it difficult to implement.\n\nI also know that the ending of net neutrality is bad, but I don't quite understand its full repercussions. Could the ending of net neutrality incentivise more people to use VPN's? If so, I feel that Mysterium becomes an even more promising project to get involved in.\n\nI know I could find the answers to these questions myself, but as I am very busy at the moment and I know there are developers and others lurking this sub that grasp these things better than I ever will, I figure i'd ask here first.

7k5zlv,1513412845,An idea for the CryptoKitties problem,"Although the CryptoKitties craze has died down a bit, there is still the open issue of exactly why it had such a drastic effect on Ethereum. To understand this, we need to dig a bit into how the CryptoKitties platform actually works:\n\nEach CryptoKitty has a unique Gene sequence which is a 256 bit value that is decoded on their website into a set of various attributes. To make a new CryptoKitty, two kitties can ""breed"" whereby their genes are mixed together plus some randomness (via the block number) to produce a new gene sequence.\n\nThe problem is that this mixing process occurs entirely on-chain and turns out to be a rather expensive operation (~250000 gas). When kitty prices are soaring, everyone wants to crank out as many kitties as possible and are willing to pay insane rates to do so. Of course this prices out everyone who just wants to send their funds/tokens around, and we're all stuck waiting for the CryptoKitties website to crash so we can actually use the network.\n\nIf you step back and think about it for a second, it's a bit crazy to be doing this wildly expensive operation on-chain and wasting large chunks of block space to do so. As an alternate idea, why not include the ability for oracles to determine the gene sequence of the new cat? This oracle could run the same solidity code as the actual mixing operation, but do it off chain, and simply present the chain with the completed calculation.\n\nOf course this alone isn't really a satisfactory solution, since we've now added a significant point of centralization to the whole thing. So you allow anyone else to double check the work of the oracle. If anyone can prove that the oracle has done something wrong (by running the birthing code on-chain, and thus demonstrating the inconsistency), then they receive a bounty paid out from the main contract and the cat is restored to its proper form. The idea is that most cats will be correct and thus the birthing code won't ever need to run on-chain, and the website will likely run an honest oracle in order to avoid paying the bounty.\n\nOf course the previous on-chain functionality can remain as a back-up, in case the oracle goes down.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: As a refinement to this idea, we could allow *anyone* to submit a potential solution for a gene mixing result, with a stake (of ETH) that certifies the validity of the computation. If the result is disputed, the stake is given to the disputer. After some timeout, the stake is available to be reclaimed by the person who submitted the result, under the assumption that no-one is going to dispute it. They then receive a portion of the birthing fee. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k5zlv/an_idea_for_the_cryptokitties_problem/,26,25
