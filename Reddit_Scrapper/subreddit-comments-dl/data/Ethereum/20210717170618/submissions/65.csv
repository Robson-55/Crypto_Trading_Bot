7fq1kk,1511732552,Can we program a smart contract that rewards tokens to bitcoin miners who mine empty blocks?,"A bitcoin transaction uses an estimated 20,000 times more energy than a VISA transaction. Bitcoiners have no desire to do anything about it and merely badmouth those who bring the issue up. Whether we like it or not, the value of cryptocurrencies increases by virtue of their dominance. Bitcoin derives a lot of its value from the fact that it's the largest cryptocurrency. The economic system of the future will be built around one cryptocurrency. It's likely going to be either Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nVitalik Buterin has spent years working on a solution that will allow us to move away from Proof of Work towards a truly energy efficient cryptocurrency. We now live in a window of opportunity, during which the world decides what protocol will become the dominant cryptocurrency. Will it be a protocol that uses 20,000 times more energy than a credit card transaction, or will it be a protocol that's truly intended to make the world a better place? At current growth rates, Bitcoin would consume all of the world's electricity by 2020. It's easy to laugh at this, but the worst case projections in 2016 estimated that by 2020, Bitcoin would use the energy consumed by Denmark. That didn't happen in 2020. It happened this year.\n\nMy suggestion is very simple: We have to maximize the chance that a cryptocurrency not based on Proof of Work will win this race for global domination. Ethereum is fine to me, for purely pragmatic concerns. Vitalik Buterin is a wise young man and the protocol he developed stands the best chance of dethroning Bitcoin, so I'm all in favor of using Ethereum for this goal.\n\nTo maximize the chances of Ethereum winning, we need the competition to lose. This might not be politically correct, but it's true nonetheless. Bitcoin's loss is our gain. To improve Ethereum's chances, it would be useful to find ways to harm Bitcoin. My suggestion is as following: Design a protocol that allows you to deliver a financial incentive to Bitcoin miners to mine (almost) empty blocks. Bitcoin's Achilles heel is its transaction capacity limit. When faced with an enemy, you need to hit the enemy where it hurts.\n\nSo my question is very simple: Does the Ethereum smart contract function allow us to design a decentralized protocol that distributes tokens to people who mine empty blocks? If we can create a financial incentive for empty block attacks against Bitcoin, empty blocks will follow, with a price decline as a consequence, triggering a positive feedback loop as people will try to cash out and Bitcoin begins to fall apart. The main problem I see right now is how we would go about giving the token value, which is why I am trying to get other people interested in my idea.\n\nI am looking for people who are willing to help me develop this project.

7fq7eu,1511734001,Can I post my beginner questions here?,"Hi there, I am not completely sure if this is acceptible practice, but I have few questions that I suppose are beginner questions, but I can't really find a clear answer in the ""Welcome/read to get started"" thread.\n\nI purchased a bit of Ethereum a while ago, so I have an adress and a password, with the ammount of Ethereum ""in it"" (is that the right phrasing?) \nI can view my balance  on *myetherwallet.com* but I hear that it's safer to download a wallet program, the way I downloaded Electrum for my Bitcoins. So now I downloaded and installed Mist, but I don't really understand what I am doing yet. \nSo (**question 1**) How do I get my Ethereum ""transferred"" to mist?  When I am in Mist I see a ""main account"" and I see the option to add new accounts. But can I import my existing Ethereum adress + password (and the ammount of Eth that is already behind that) or isn't that how it works? Or should I transfer my Ethereum that is currently in my existing adress, to a new adress in Mist?\n\nAlso (**question 2**):\nWhat's with the ""syncing"" (?) of like 4 million records whenever I launch Mist? What is it doing and is this going to take so long everytime I launch it? I have never noticed something like that when I launch Electrum for instance (for my Bitcoins), but maybe there is an explanation or a difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum that I am completely missing.\n\nCome to think of it, I have two more questions:\n\n**3.**\nWhat is the difference between EthereumWallet and Mist? Which is better for me? I just want to be able to simply buy, store, and sell Ethereum. But the two names seem to be used confusingly, and for some reason both have the same download page. I am confused. I downloade Mist because I heard that's the one that was recommended to me, but now I am not sure.\n\n**4.**\nSo my next question is, once I have my Ethereum in Mist, how do I sell it when I want to? Because I can't find a buy/sell option in Mist, or isn't that how it works?\n\nThanks in advance and sorry if these are newbie questions, or the wrong place to ask them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7fq7eu/can_i_post_my_beginner_questions_here/,3,5

They pointed me to this tool called the vault decryptor. https://support.metamask.io/kb/article/22-how-to-copy-your-vault-data\n\nThis lets you paste in some code from your metamask extension found in Chrome, and enter your password, and it unlocks your vault. My problem is that in the process of recovery i have reinstalled metamask a couple times, so when i do this recovery, it only lets me recover the most recent new wallet which is of course empty. \n\nwhat I need to do is to be able to recover the metamask config file outlined in the second link from my old version of the extension. \n\nHas anyone else dealt with anything remotely like this? or know how to recover local files for deleted chrome extensions?
