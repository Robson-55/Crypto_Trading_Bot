7knrnh,1513627564,Stolen Ether,"So, Ethereum hit a new ATH today. Putting the price of my stolen Ether up to 45 thousand euro.. It certainly doesn't get easier after time.. I know for some people that may not exactly be life changing, but for me, it literally was( had plans to setup a business with it).. Anyway. My point is, as the price goes up higher, the more frustrated I become.. Has anybody had any luck in recovering stolen Ethereum? eg Tracking addresses to  exchanges/kyc ICOs etc...\n The ether was transferred to Changelly and the tokens to Shapeshift, I contacted both of them and both IPs associated were Tor exit nodes.. Is there anything else that I may be missing? \n\nAlso for questions. I got hacked about 6 weeks ago now. My security wasn't the best. My google account was comprised(possibly spoofed mobile number) and they gained access to my PC using remote desktop. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Can someone who is better at this can see what is going on?\n\nOne thing I noticed was that it went from my acocunt to another account (which only had one transaction) to another account which had 43 transactions(0x451e28d2c08e21622450b8f810f2a5ea7fee202f) (40 incoming and 3 going out). And all 43 incoming transactions had occurred at around the same time. I thought that this was a bit strange. It's not like the hacker hacked all of these people at the same time?\n\nAnd from there 98 went another account that also paid some to a Bittrex account.... I am really confused at this point. Can someone please take a look and help me figure out what happend?\n\nThank you so much",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ko2h7/can_someone_help_with_some_tracking_trying_to/,4,4
