7e2jvh,1511117563,Blockchain OS,"https://www.coindesk.com/intel-ledger-partner-cryptocurrency-storage-integration/\n\nI wasn't exactly sure which subreddit to post this to but I figured r/ethereum was a good place.\n\nI saw this article a while back and it got me thinking: ""What would a blockchain OS look like?""\n\nNow I know that Intel and Ledger are not partnering to create an OS but my mind wandered down that path, several times over the last couple of weeks.\n\nOne way I thought that this could work is with phones. It would be an OS that would hold all of your personal data that companies and governments use daily. This would allow for ownership over your virtual self and allow you to sell your data and to know when this is accessed. So I think for this to work, you would need a way to record whenever information is accessed on the phone from a 3rd party (such as signalling when the camera was accessed without your knowledge, etc.). The problem that I imagined in this scenario is that if some clever hacker manages to rewrite the code of the OS so that it stops signalling when the phone's hardware is used or data is accessed, then this solves nothing.\n\nSo today I thought about another way a Blockchain OS could exist. What if there was a network of nodes constantly verifying all copies of this blockchain OS code so that any changes made to it are caught by the nodes and then the user is notified immediately. I think that the part of the OS being monitored by the network would really only be the core software, the lines of code that interact with hardware. \n\nI chose this because I would like creativity and personalization to still be available for everyone. So this core OS that is being cryptographically secured would be like a protocol, a infrastructure that OS devs can use and build on top of. This also reduces the load on the nodes that already are constantly verifying an entire OS worth of code. I'm assuming that to mine the blockchain OS, the network would need a large amount of hashing power.\n\nTl;dr: To summarize, I believe I may have just thought of a really cool use case of blockchain where the core components of an OS are being monitored for changes by nodes so that an entity, a government or a hacker, could not tamper with the OS's code without the entire network being made aware. There could also be some machine learning algorithms (I know buzz word lol) looking for malware installs. This would basically be a decentralized anti-virus built-in the OS. So there would be a coin to incentivize the nodes, the OS would be open source and the community would get to vote on proposals to improve the OS. I think this is a really cool idea.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I really want to try and grow this idea further. Thanks for your time.

""you don't trust trucker Tom, so let's make a smart contract that he gets paid once the GPS of his truck is there"" - like nobody has to check that the cargo is intact (and sign off on that).

7e7dvi,1511165380,Good news coming in the next weeks and months,"This month:\n\n* microRaiden. Achieves instantly and without fees **thousands of transactions per second.** This first version is for Ethereum tokens, which makes trivial the transfer of ETH too (see explanation 1 at the end of the post).\n* Casper test network. Casper is the next version of Ethereum, where everyone can be a ""miner"" and earn money, because Ethereum abandons the electricity-wasting mining invented by Bitcoin. With Casper, being a miner means staking ETH in the network and offering a very little bit of computer power. Miner's money is left intact and (s)he is rewarded if (s)he does a good job. The security does not arise from energy wasting computations, but because any attempt to cheat the security will be penalised by the network (ETH removed from the stake). **It means that people are incited to accumulate ETH now and hold once Casper is alive.** The more you buy now that the price is cheap, the more you can earn later.\n\nIn 2018:\n\n* ETH futures. **Futures trading is coming** before June 2018, as announced by Bloomberg a few days ago.\n* Upgrade of the network, with an intermediary version before Casper, based on hybrid security : traditional miners will still be able to mine, and **stakers will also be allowed**, as described above. Later, Casper will be fully deployed, only staking will be possible.\n* More than 200 companies (such as Intel, Microsoft, JP Morgan, ING, Bank of America, UBS, Mastercard, ...) are part of the **Enterprise Ethereum Alliance**. They started to develop almost one year ago and the first outcomes might be released.\n\n\n1: It allows for creating a decentralised system (contract) which receives your ETH budget, then convert your payments to tokens, transfers them through microRaiden, and your recipient withdraws the corresponding ETHs when the channel is closed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7e7dvi/good_news_coming_in_the_next_weeks_and_months/,299,98

7e7oq1,1511169697,Secure Entropy For Crypto Secret Generation - Looking for review help,"Hi guys, we at [AirGap.it](https://AirGap.it) are putting a lot of effort into making crypto more secure and ultimately more accessible for everyone. We just released an open source javascript app to generate secrets securely by mixing/adding different sources of entropy.\n\nThe idea is that using the standard native secure random API's is not enough (e.g. what myetherwallet is doing) for secret generation because one does not actually know with how much entropy the PRNG has been seeded. For this reason we pipe:  \n- voice/microphone stream  \n- video stream  \n- mouse movements  \n\ninto a SHA3 hash and ultimately use the native secure random as additional source of entropy. The output is an mnemonic string that can be used with Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc (see https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).\n\nIt would be great if someone could help us reviewing the code (it's pure JavaScript and less than 100 lines of code) and check if it makes sense.\n\nThe live App can be found here:  [GitHub Pages](https://airgap-it.github.io/airgap-secure-random-secret-generator/#)  \nThe source code can be found here: [GitHub] (https://github.com/airgap-it/airgap-secure-random-secret-generator)\n\n\nWe'd really like to hear your feedback on this comments/ideas on how to make this more accessible or more secure are really appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7e7oq1/secure_entropy_for_crypto_secret_generation/,18,20
