7m9qmo,1514316526,Generic way to view ERC721 token ownership,"I have been dabbling in the ethereum ecosystem for a few months, just to get familiar with solidity and web3.  \n\nWhile doing some research on ERC721 tokens for a ""for fun"" project, I haven't found a way to generically view ERC721 tokens associated with a particular address.  The most popular app being cryptokitties, I think the only *user-facing* way to see your kitty 'ownership' is on the CK website.\n\nThinking about it some more, it seems the same problem applies to ERC20 tokens, excepting that you can plug in the contract address into MEW to see the token balances.\n\nThis has raised a few questions and I am not having a lot of luck finding the answers:\n\n 1. how do MEW and other ERC20 wallet providers keep track of which contracts to scan when looking up an address?  Is it all ""invented here"" by each wallet provider?\n\n 2. Are erc20 wallet providers really scanning a collection of ownership arrays in the token contracts every time they display the erc20 balances?  \n\n 3. Is there a user-facing site that can do generic ERC721  ""balances"" and/or details?   \n\n 4. Is there a registry out there somewhere for ERC20 and/or ERC721 contracts?  It seems like there should be.\n\n(edited for clarity)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7m9qmo/generic_way_to_view_erc721_token_ownership/,23,7
