New markets, new forms of financial instruments, will rise and fall over days and weeks, taking what used to cost millions of dollars and years to create down into a few lines of code.\n\nThe good is that rent-seeking will go down, access to financial tools will go up, and there will be more opportunities for financial mobility. The bad is that with the speed of new developments, the tightly coupled/automated nature of smart contracts, and the lack of an off button, bubbles, crashes, and negative feedback loops can quickly and easily impact the system.\n\nIn 10 years when someone writes a book on the history of the blockchain-based economic sector, they'll start with an anecdote about crypto-kittes ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7i8is4/and_meanwhile_a_multimillion_dollar_market_forms/,245,38

We have been around since 2010 with a mission to create unbias mass adoption for useful digital assets. \n\nWe're the leading source that supplies VIP institutions with research and forecasts. Cryptonaire has been following Ethereum since 2015. \n\n**Our message: For those of you that remember when games were first established on the internet; it was really frustrating to play. However, with patience and dedication came innovation. This is not a roadblock. This is a milestone that is about to be accomplished. Not just any milestone. A milestone that is similar to the transition of dial-up to high speed internet. Ethereums blockchain capabilities will expand to an efficient and effective universal blockchain. Fixing this kitty will show you the strength and worth of Ethereum. Majority of price declines; are not because of this *issue*. It's because of the bitcoin rally. We are all one. We are all one team, and that's blockchains. We should support each other's success. Just remember how smooth you play your online games these days, that's the internet.

ICO tomorrow.,"We’ve received a bunch of messages the past couple days all wondering where the giveaway threads went and why they were removed. Unfortunately, those who do not agree with Vector’s vision have been reporting our giveaway posts and the mods continually remove them. All we wanted to do was let the community know about our exchange, nobody had to upvote, and nobody had to comment.          Yet, a few people who did not receive satisfactory answers from us turned against us, which is unfortunate. We will not let those few people ruin it for the rest of you who support Vector and our vision to become the number one cryptocurrency exchange in the world. This post is not a giveaway. One random commenter will end up with 4 eth in their Ethereum wallet.
