7mo3q3,1514483344,"I sent .001 BTC to my ETH wallet while it was downloading initially, took a week to confirm, BTC did not convert to ETH and deposit.","EDIT:  In case you didn't know, you can buy ETH with BTC directly from the wallet app: https://imgur.com/a/81FWV\n\nOn December 18th, I started to download the Ethereum wallet, and while it was downloading it prompted me to fund my wallet with BTC.  So I sent ~20 dollars, but did not include a very high transaction fee, it just got confirmed:\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/tx/8e8096a94c1f2bf13986cda2857d28649d170fa3268fd5a30d8955abdd094d5a\n\nBut, after that tx was confirmed, it was never converted to ETH and deposited to my wallet...\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x857eAe48E98b80fDcFe4c1f6c67f890AD3A6bbaA\n\n\nSo what gives?  I haven't been able to download the blockchain, I've given up on that, but I would like to move that 20 dollars of ETH I purchased to my Jaxx wallet.  Am I SOL?  Did I get screwed by the network?  \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mo3q3/i_sent_001_btc_to_my_eth_wallet_while_it_was/,4,13

What happens to innacurate data?\n\nI'd like to place sensors in beehives around the world to monitor colony collapse syndrome. This would require lots of individual beekeepers to place and maintain sensors and upload their data to a blockchain.\n\n- Practically speaking, how can I get beekeepers on board with using a blockchain backed data collection system and what's in it for them?\n- what is the best off blockchain solution for this problem?\n\nI am aware of projects like TruSet under the ConsenSys umbrella that are seeking to incentivize the standardization of financial data, but I don't have a firm grasp on how verification of data and production of data is rewarded. \n\nThanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mpcwf/incentivizing_data_collection/,0,1

7mq54b,1514501803,Plasma Withdrawal Question,"I was discussing Plasma in another thread yesterday and ended up re-reading some of the documentation. Addressing the withdrawal-attack issue:\n\n&gt;In the event of a large attack on Plasma subchains, all users of the Plasma subchains would need to withdraw back to the root chain. If Plasma has O(N) users, then this will require O(N) transactions, and so O(N / C) time to process all of the withdrawals. If withdrawal delays are fixed to some D (ie. the naive implementation), then as soon as N &gt; C * D, there will not be enough space in the blockchain to process all withdrawals in time, and so the system will be insecure; in this mode, Plasma should be viewed as increasing scalability only by a (possibly large) constant factor. \n\nMy question is this: Can we create a function within the plasma chain that detects `if &gt; X of deposits are currently trying to be withdrawn for Y blocks` then `pool all withdrawals into one transaction and send it to a smart contract on the root chain` where users can withdraw their claims individually? Would this not mitigate the attack vector of the funds getting ""stuck""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mq54b/plasma_withdrawal_question/,9,1
