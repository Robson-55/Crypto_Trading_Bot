7fddey,1511589537,Is there any reason Ethereum can't use an existing high integrity language like ADA Spark for smart contracts?,"To start with I'm a massive fan of the platform and the work the core Ethereum team are doing. \n\nI'm curious as to the reasoning for developing a new programming language for smart contracts. \n\nIt appears there are good candidates that could be used instead. Using existing languages could save development effort and reduce risk by making use of already optimised and safe languages.\n\nFor example the DOD has spent a lot of money already creating ADA Spark which allows the development of provable bug free applications (excluding compiler bugs). It is also quite a verbose language, but that's the trade-off you pay for security.\n\nSolidity appears to be designed for ease of development. This is important of course for adoption, but smart contracts are not web pages where the odd javascript bug is acceptable. Smart contracts are permanent, high stakes and have more in common with a processor design than a web page.\n\nIs there a particular reason or would looking into integrating a language like ADA Spark be a worthwhile project?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARK_(programming_language)\nhttp://www.spark-2014.org/\n\nEDIT: Found this thread from a year ago with some comments, it appears Augur's Joey Krug was also interested in using ADA Spark. https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5cpplr/a_few_clarifications_on_viper_serpent_and_hlls/",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7fddey/is_there_any_reason_ethereum_cant_use_an_existing/,163,105
