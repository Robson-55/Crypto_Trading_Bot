7sre6r,1516835796,Interested in a Tomagachi-styled cold-storage/saving dApp?,"I started out with dApp development some time ago, and are looking to develop a bigger project. I have always wanted to create a game where micro-transactions was sent to a savings account instead of someone's pocket.\n\n**How it works:**\nYou create an account and connect to Metamask. You now take care of a charming fellow, let's say a Corgi. You have to feed him by buying food, play with him, buy toys etc. The money(ETH) you spend on your corgi gets locked in a contract for either 3, 6, 9 or 12 months.  After that they will be returned to you. If it's an emergency, you can get your funds back immediately, but you will have to kill your corgi :(\n\nWhat do you guys think? Would love some feedback!

7ss3bw,1516842038,Question on Non-Fungible/Utility Tokens &amp; Exchanges,"So for trading tokens on exchanges, ERC20 tokens seem pretty straightforward - it's just a unit of account, each unit is exactly like every other unit, and it can be bought &amp; sold on exchanges at the market price.  But what about non-fungible tokens &amp; utility tokens? For non-fungible tokens (e.g. ERC721 tokens), they'd have to be sold one token (or batch of tokens) at a time - but if the non-fungible token is a tokenized real world asset, the buyers and sellers on the exchanges would need some kind of auxiliary information about what the real world asset is in order to properly price the token? Let's assume the ERC721 non-fungible token is a contract of ownership for some unit of real world good/service - and can be exchanged for that real world good/service.\nAre there any exchanges today which allow buying/selling of ERC721/non-fungible/utility tokens?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ss3bw/question_on_nonfungibleutility_tokens_exchanges/,1,1
