7f36f8,1511477384,A simple addition to make PoS safer in the long term,"**Short summary:** entice all transactions (from EOAs - non-contract accounts) to include a hash of a recent block to confirm its validity. \n\nIn short-term, block producers' incentives can be ensured by slashing (eg. removing incurred rewards or locked deposit) or other solutions. In the long-term they don't work because there's no locked deposit to penalize at the correct chain.  \nHowever, if every valid transaction had to include a hash of a recent block they could be counted as a voting stake. \nIn the long run, total stake validating the correct chain would comprise a very high percentage of all coins - making the nothing at stake attack much harder. \n\n**Details:**  \n1. At block *B_1*, assign every EOA voting power equivalent to its balance.  \n2. Sender account of a transaction that confirms block *B_1* must exist at *B_1*. Which also means that the transaction can only be included in a descendant of *B_1*.  \n3. Transactions from accounts that confirm a future block *B_n* (n&gt;1) that have *B_1* as an ancestor, confirm *B_1* implicitly according to their voting power (balance) at *B_1*. (which means it's usually going to be zero)  \n4. Votes from same accounts don't add up (ie. the maximum stake voting for a block is 100%).  \n5. Block generation is counted as a vote in the same manner. \n\nWhat this means is that stake voting for old blocks is going to approach 100% of EOAs and staking accounts, as eventually even dormant accounts are likely to do at least one transaction. \n\n**Valid chain criteria:**  \nFor most recent blocks (current time - validators' deposit lock period) ignore transaction votes and proceed according to a separate network consensus algorithm. \nFor older blocks, chain with most stake votes wins, ie:  \nFor every child *y* of a known valid block *X*, *y* with the highest voting stake is assumed valid. \n\n**Contracts:**  \nTransactions from contracts don't vote because there's no clear way to connect intent with their total balance. \n\nedit: **Example**  \n**Block *B_1*:**  \nAccount A1 has a balance of 100 ETH. \nAccount X1 has a balance of 10 ETH.   \n**Block *B_2*:**  \nA1 transfers 50 ETH to A2 and 50 ETH to A3, explicitly confirming *B_1*. His counted voting stake is 100 ETH because he had 100 confirmed ETH in *B_1*.  \n**Block *B_3*:**  \nA2 transfers some eth to some other account. He can explicitly and implicitly confirm only *B_2* with 50 ETH because his account doesn't exist before that.  \n\nTransaction votes are:  \n*B_1* 100 ETH (from A1's tx in *B_2*),  \n*B_2* 50 ETH (from A2's tx in *B_3*),  \n*B_3* 0. \n\n**Block *B_4*:** A3 does some transaction, explicitly confirming block *B_3*.  \nNow transaction votes are:  \n*B_1*: 100 ETH (explicitly from A1's tx in *B_2*),  \n*B_2*: 100 ETH (explicitly 50 ETH from A2's tx in *B_3* + implicitly 50 ETH from A3's tx in *B_4*),  \n*B_3* 50 ETH (explicitly 50 ETH from A3's tx in *B_4*),  \n*B_4* 0\n\nA1's account is empty since *B_2* so he sells his private key to attacker, who starts to generate his own chain, forked before or at *B_1*. He can confirm his chain with 100 ETH, which means both forks are now equivalent.  However, as soon as X1 does a transaction on the main chain, confirmation for block *B_2* goes up to 110 ETH, while the fake chain only can confirm 100 ETH. The main chain wins thanks to X1's transaction.  \n**This makes the nothing at stake attack infeasible.** \n\n----\nThoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7f36f8/a_simple_addition_to_make_pos_safer_in_the_long/,14,8
