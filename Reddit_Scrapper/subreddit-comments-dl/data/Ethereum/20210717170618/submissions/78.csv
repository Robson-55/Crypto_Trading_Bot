7gp1xm,1512071432,Implications of ERC #780 and Regulation in Crypto,"ERC #780 was recently opened yesterday by Joel Torstensson at consensys. He brought forward the concept of a Ethereum Claim Registry. The idea is you are able to create a contract which can make claims about others. You have 4 values: \n\n\n* The issuer (who adds the claim into the regsitry)\n\n\n* The subject (who the claim is regarding)\n\n\n* The key (what the claim is e.g. ""credit score"", ""points"", or ""status"")\n\n\n* The value the bytes 32 value for the key\n\n\nAt first this doesn't seem like much, however, this can be used to create a massive blacklist of addresses to prevent exchanges from buying crypto from hackers or others who used illicit means to acquire these. Governments can simply create this list and create regulations requiring all cash to crypto transactions to require a registry check.\n\n\nObviously before ERC#780 nothing stopped governments from imposing such limitations but it definitely opens the door a little bit more.\n\n\nObviously there are many more uses for a registry like this but this made me think and I want to know if you think this is a possibility?

I'm currently building out a dApp, and it will need to store highly sensitive personal information in some way.\n\nA couple ways I have thought to do this:\n\n1. Encrypt the data and store in on the public chain. This has a couple of downsides to it, namely that it increases the size of the blockchain and data that is encrypted now might be decryptable down the road with advancing technology/quantum computing.\n\n2. Store the data itself in IPFS on a private network, with pointers to the location/hash of the data files living in the public ethereum blockchain. \n\nI'd love folks' thoughts on best practices for storing highly sensitive data in a decentralized way that maintains a high-level of security of the content of the data itself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7gqbaj/storing_private_data_on_the_blockchain_in_a/,1,2
