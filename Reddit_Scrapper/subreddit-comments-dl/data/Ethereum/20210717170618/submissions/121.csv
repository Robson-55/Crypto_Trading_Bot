7japg3,1513085279,Idea how to deal with frozen Ethers once and for all,"I just read that Parity calls for a hard fork to deal with the frozen ethers. I don't want us to deal with such issues again and again (I bet my ass that such cases will happen again and I guess such cases already happened with low volume) and therefore I thought about different ways to deal with that problem.\n\n\nIn my mind I came across the story of the [Rai stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones). That were huge round and flat stones used as money. But they are heavy to transport and could only be transported as one piece. So buying an item within a community with one of these stones involved an agreement that (a part of) the ownership changes. This transaction was then recorded in the oral history of the community. Inter-community trade involved physically transporting the stone(s). \n\n\nThe same could be done with the frozen Parity Ether. Parity could create a token, which represents the frozen ethers and are distributed 1-to-1 to the affected ether owner. Anyone and any (future) contract could accept these tokens as substitute if they want to. As we can all see, that these ether still exist and don't move (like the Roi stones), we can trust and accept this substitute.\n\n\nAs such incidents with frozen ethers will happen again (and I guess already happened with low volume of ether involved), a trustworthy entity (I'm thinking of the Ethereum Foundation, but it can be anyone else) could issue such a substitute ether token for any reported verifiable frozen ether 1-on-1 to the affected addresses and could even charge a 1% *rescue service fee*. Now I know this could be abused very easily as it is money printing. But every case can - thanks to the transparent blockchain - be verified by anyone, therefore the token issuer can be cached in an act of trust abuse very easily.\n\n\nEven if you don't trust the mentioned ""trusted"" issuer, you could accept any other ether substitute of anyone you trust or even accept no substitute at all. This could be a simple setting in the Ethereum client. Contracts of course have to explicitly accept such an ether substitute by code and could even raise a fee for using an ether substitute. Interestingly a substitute issuer could also trust other issuers and offer a atomic token swap. Theoretically a whole network of ""frozen ether substitute issuer"" companies/institutions/experts could emerge with optional trust lines between them and fee charge or expense allowance as their business model.\n\n\nIt would even be possible to execute a periodical ""currency reform"" with ether, involving a replacement of any trusted ether substitute and destroying the frozen contracts every 5 years or so. This option seems very dangerous to me, so this should be reserved to emergency situations, network rescue operations or a network overhaul. But before that the frozen ether substitution has to work reliably. \n\n\nPlease let me know what you think of this idea even if you don't like it. Constructive criticism appreciated.
