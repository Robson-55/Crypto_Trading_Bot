7jycap,1513324466,Geth JS console code execution issue,"Hi, I was experimenting with private ethereum blockchain on my PC to learn some new stuff about this ecosystem and I had an issue with executing some custom JS on the JS console on geth.\n\nI wanted to count the total number of transaction on my blockchain and I wrote some JS:\n\n    var count = 0;\n    var highestCount = eth.getBlock(""latest"").number;\n    for(var i=0; i&lt;highestCount; i++){\n	    count += eth.getBlock(i).transactions.length;\n    }\n\nBut the code doesn't execute fully. It stops after encountering the first non-empty block and adding the transaction count of that block to 'var count'.\n\nOn this private blockchain I made 1 transaction which was mined in block 26, and 3 transactions which were mined in block 49.\n\nSo, the code stops at i=26, with count as 1.\n\nI tried starting the loop with i=27, and this time it doesn't even add the 3 from block 49. Just exits with no change to 'var count'.\n\nAlternatively,\n\n    eth.getBlock(26).transactions.length + eth.getBlock(49).transactions.length\n\ngives the correct result of 4.\n\nCan someone please help me out with why the JS code isn't working? Thanks!\n\n#EDIT:\n OK. Massive mistake from my side. The last block 49 had the 3 transactions. So, the '&lt;' should have been '&lt;=' to account for all blocks.My bad. sorry.\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jycap/geth_js_console_code_execution_issue/,6,5

I've seen people calling that ""gas limit"" as well, now I'm confused.\n\nAlso what / who (as far as I understood so far miners have some say in that regard) determines what the max amount of calculations is, until the block is considered full?\n\nWhere can I look up the current maximum amount of calculations / gas uses per block?

7jyw6j,1513333493,Crypto Kitties impact is overrated,"I keep reading this FUD that a kitty game broke Ethereum. \n\nAccording to gas guzzlers, cryptokitties is only responsible for ~6% of the transaction traffic (CK &amp; CK Auction). \nThe Ethereum network processed more non-CK transactions yesterday than it did two days before INCLUDING cryptokitties. Etherdelta is actually a much larger producer of transactions. \n\nIt's not kitties breaking Ethereum, it's all the other uses as well. We are becoming a victim of our own success until scaling solutions come live and get used (just look at how slow adoption of something simple as Segwit is). \n\nIt already looks like exchanges are unable to keep their wallets functional. \n\nhttps://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jyw6j/crypto_kitties_impact_is_overrated/,60,17
