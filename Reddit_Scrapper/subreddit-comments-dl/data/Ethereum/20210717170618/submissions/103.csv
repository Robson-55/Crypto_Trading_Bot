7i69qf,1512651580,My thoughts on BTC vs ETH,"When you think of cryptocurrency, bitcoins come into mind readily as it is the market cap leader by far. It dominates on news outlets almost everyday. But cryptocurrency is somewhat of a vague term and I came into the realization that something like BTC to ETH is more of an orange to apple comparison. \n\nYes they are both cryptocurrency using blockchain technology, but intended purposes are different. BTC was designed to be a currency where you can buy goods and services in competition with the dollar. Ether on the other hand is a token that will be solely used to interact with the ethereum network, whether you're a user or a developer of smart apps. The ethereum network is a platform for blockchain technology and happens to incorporate something called smart contracts, which make it compelling for big businesses to get involved (i.e Ethereum Alliance).\n\nAnyways the point I am trying to make is that you are betting on 2 different things between BTC and ETH. With BTC, you are betting that more people will lose faith in the dollar and consequently more acceptance of BTC made by vendors. With ETH you're betting that companies will increasingly use blockchain technology for their business needs and be part of the Ethereum network. Both cryptocurrency can be successful but with different causalities. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7i69qf/my_thoughts_on_btc_vs_eth/,0,2
