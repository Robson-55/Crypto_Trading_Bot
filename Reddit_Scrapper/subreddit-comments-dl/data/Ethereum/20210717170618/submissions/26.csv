7c38bv,1510340925,Forking Bitcoin into an ERC20 token,"Everyone knows Bitcoin is broken. A few months ago, Vitalik even mentioned that someone could work on an ETH-based version of Bitcoin.\n\nIt would be great to see Bitcoin as an ERC20 token, B20 for short. This way the new Bitcoin could fully benefit from ETHs features and improvements, and also faster development.\n\nOnce a block number is decided for the ""fork"", each bitcoin address could access the B20 platform to claim their B20 tokens that will match the Bitcoin balance on fork block.\n\nThe B20 contract, should make it possible to verify bitcoin balance by address on a certain block, to then proceed to create B20 tokens when requested.\n\nThere should also be a time cap to claim B20 tokens, this way ""burning"" unused or lost Bitcoins or uninterested maximalists.\n\nI would like to see some debate on the matter if possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7c38bv/forking_bitcoin_into_an_erc20_token/,1,14

7c3sya,1510346200,I have an idea. We make Ethereum go VIRAL. (x-post from /r/ethtrader),"Yes, you read that right. \n\n**Viral.**\n\n""How are we going to do this?"" I hear you asking. \n\nWell, it's simple: *we start putting our wallet address at the end of every public internet post or written item.*\n\n""That's dumb/annoying/not going to work!"" you're telling me. *I get it.* \n\nThe point is: If all of us start posting our Ethereum wallet address at the end of our posts, sooner or later the average Joe who knows nothing about eth will start to wonder about ""all this 0x spam"". Slowly but surely, more and more people will begin to look into Ethereum. People may even start feeling bad *they* don't have any 0x to put at the end of their own posts. 0x will become a literal internet meme, and adoption and mainstream knowledge of Ethereum will increase tenfold.\n\n""This sounds very far-fetched. Won't we start getting kicked off of forums for what basically amounts to e-begging? People are going to hate seeing 0x strings plastered across forums everywhere! Even *I* hate seeing people's address!""\n\n*I know people are going to dislike it*. People/subs/websites might even ban people ""spamming"" their wallet address. It's part of the plan, if you understand the concept of **""any news is good news""**. With every news article about ""0x"" being banned, mainstream knowledge and adoption will increase. ETH will soar. Ethereum utilization will become the norm. **The network will flourish.** Every detractor will become our benefactor; every news article will add more and more intensity to the flaming whirlwind that is Ethereum. The end goal, of course, is that donating Ethereum will replace features like gilding/Thanking users on forums.\n\n**The flippening has to happen someday, ladies and gentlemen. We can wait on it forever, or we can help the process along**. I choose the latter.\n\nMade it this far in the post? Congratulations. I'll take this moment to add: If you're going to do this, *do it right.* **Don't** tell people it's ""like bitcoin"". **Don't** tell people it has to do with money. **Involving money or Bitcoin will instantly repulse ~90% of the mainstream**. Just post the address and something that describes it. On every post you submit, *just post or write your address.* \n\nWe can do this, people. I have high hopes for Ethereum and I'm willing to ~~stake~~ bet that you do too. A simple method like this is by far the easiest way of going about the process.\n\nThis is just the beginning.\n\neth: 0x5260B30993615eE778B28c9D149fA4Ca7434Bc06\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7c3sya/i_have_an_idea_we_make_ethereum_go_viral_xpost/,1,11

7c6lbz,1510376925,Sick idea for a DAPP. Im not a developer. Please steal my idea.,"Ok so heres my idea:\n\nDisrupt Patreon model by adding in a raffle / lottery to sweeten the deal to incentivize followers to support your brand or channel monthly.\n\nLets say you have 100,000 followers on your social media. Each subscriber contributes $1 per month - like on patreon for exclusive content. Except unlike patreon where you only get exclusive content, every month a random winner is generated, and wins a jackpot lottery for a percentage amount of followers you have. Lets say you, as the brand and operator of the lottery, keep 20% or however much you want to keep....but lets just say 20%. At $100,000 a month, you keep $20,000/month, and a random follower wins $80,000\n\nThe odds would be much better for you to win since its a relatively smaller number than state lottery odds, and you'd be participating every month, automatically, to brands and influencers you'd already support on patreon. win win for everyone.\n\nCan you imagine if everyone did this? We could all run our own raffles based on numbers of followers, and also participate in each others raffles.\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7c6lbz/sick_idea_for_a_dapp_im_not_a_developer_please/,74,72
