7sf227,1516720651,Why recreational dApps matter and how they can push Ethereum forward,"*I am the developer of a dApp named [KryptoWar](https://kryptowar.com), it's a war game based entirely on the Ethereum Blockchain. I wanted to share with you a blog post to talk about recreational decentralized apps and why they matter.*\n\n---\n\n*This article was originally published [here](https://kryptowar.com/blog/recreational-decentralized-applications/).*\n\n---\nJust a couple of years ago, if you had told me that dApps were going to scale to a massive degree and generate millions of dollars in sales I would have called you crazy. However, 2017 certainly proved the potential of dApps. But how exactly? \n\nThroughout 2017, both blockchain technology’s reputation managed to rapidly grow, as well as a variety of blockchain currencies. With an enhanced reputation, massive user-growth became inevitable. Today, dApps represent (in my opinion) one of the Blockchain's most promising use case.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nBefore diving in, I think I should clarify what dApps actually are. For starters, the term is short for decentralized application. If you’re already involved in the blockchain industry, the definition is self-explanatory and you can just skip to the next section. If you’re new, a typical app has a central authority, which is typically the creator of the app. Central authorities can play a negative influence on user-experience and privacy, whether through accessing your information used on the platform, censoring the content you put, and so on. A dApp takes away this central authority and often rewards users for contributing toward the success of the dApp.\n\nHow do dApps work?\n------------------\n\nDecentralized apps have been growing on par with Ethereum’s success as a result of Ethereum’s [innate compatibility](https://www.coindesk.com/7-cool-decentralized-apps-built-ethereum/) with developing apps. But the processes aren’t particularly intuitive. Just to clarify, this section is a vast over simplification of the overall process of dApps. To discuss how dApps truly work would require loads of more information and would distract the ultimate focus of this post—the importance of four recreational dApps. To deploy a dApp, it needs to have some sort of connection to the blockchain. Often times, to maintain distance from the main blockchain network—whether it’s for security purposes, performance, etc.—developers use sidechains, a form of decentralized blockchains, for dApps. One major tool used for browsing decentralized apps is known as [web3js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/). The JavaScript API allows people to use dApps with tools like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or the [Cipher Browser](https://www.cipherbrowser.com/). Combined with a UI like the [Ethereum test RPC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcTPjpPvas8) (note: this requires nodeJS), you can use web3js to easily exchange smart contracts. Without further ado, let’s get into the importance of four specific recreational apps, starting with CryptoKitties.\n\n### CryptoKitties\n\nThis app is very likely the most known recreational dApp. Attracting headlines like “the [Beanie Babies of blockchain](http://www.businessinsider.com/ethereum-cryptokitties-collectible-2018-1)” and “How one CryptoKitty was flipped for [$60,000 in four days](https://qz.com/1148553/cryptokitties-how-one-digital-cat-was-flipped-for-60000-over-four-days/),” it is needless to say that CryptoKitties has garned quite a lot of traffic. I’m sure many of you already know about [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) but for those that don’t, it is an app where you can collect different digital cats. The cats themselves have different “genetic” makeups and so on, which makes each one distinct. The nuances of the game are cool, but the implications of its growth and the increased attention brought about one major “pro” of dApps and one major “con.” First: the good. CryptoKitties traffic is extremely high. In fact, in just a few days of being online, according to TechCrunch, the app already had handled over [$1,000,000 in purchases](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/03/people-have-spent-over-1m-buying-virtual-cats-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/). But that part isn’t as impressive as the next statistic—in the same period of time, nearly [15 percent of all Ethereum traffic](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/03/people-have-spent-over-1m-buying-virtual-cats-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/) was driven toward the game. The growth has proven that blockchain apps have the potential to become adopted at a mainstream degree, as well as become a part of popular culture. Now comes the bad. While Cryptokitties’ growth rate was shocking, the quick attention also brought scrutiny. With its success, it became increasingly clear that the app was not truly decentralized. In fact, in a [_Medium_ blog post](https://medium.com/@CryptoKitties/is-cryptokitties-decentralized-9823b5f168af), the CryptoKitties team explained how their app wouldn’t have been as user-friendly if it were completely decentralized. Specifically, the UI and gene algorithms were centralized. _""Completely decentralizing CryptoKitties would have resulted in a game that wasn't as fun, and we would have crippled our efforts to bringing blockchain to the masses.""_ Regardless, as cute of a game as it is, CryptoKitties has serious implications regarding the blockchain—and they are for the best. To best summarize the positive impact of the dApp, [Buterin tweeted](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/937633758781497344?lang=en): “Agree it's not close to fully decentralized in its current form. But I think people see that it can be.” The game isn’t a complete decentralized success story but it’s a giant leap in the right direction.\n\n### Smart Billions\n\nRecreational games, of course, include gambling—and, specifically, participating in a blockchain lottery. [Smart Billions](https://smartbillions.com/) launched as one of the first decentralized lotteries and made a strong mark in potentially altering a global industry. With smart contracts, the blockchain lottery was able to [increase its transparency](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/the-most-fair-lottery-or-how-smartbillions-is-destroying-centuries-old-superstitions) and decrease the risk of fraud (since there’s no central authority who can skew the outcomes). The platform runs off of Ethereum and seems to show a lot of potential for dApps to be completely decentralized. However, right before launching, they had a big issue: they were hacked. In October, the smart lottery founding team offered a prize of $450,000 in Ether (1,500ETH at the time) to anyone who can [hack the system](https://medium.com/@SmartBillions/smartbillions-hackathon-offically-started-deac083316f8) and withdraw funds. It took two days for [a couple of hackers](https://calvinayre.com/2017/10/13/bitcoin/500k-hack-challenge-backfires-blockchain-lottery-smartbillions/) to withdraw 400ETH or $120,000 then and win the hackathon. While the contest was for the improvement of Smart Billions, the successful hacking—in my eyes—deterred a lot from being as excited about the launch and instead being more cautious. The overall implication of this is that decentralized apps are a relatively new concept and, like most new concepts, they are susceptible. However, Smart Billion’s quick fix and subsequent launch proves that even when there are technical issues, the blockchain community will just quickly fix them and continue to grow—unlike most new industries, which lose consumer confidence from issues in their early stages.\n\n### KryptoWar\n\nAs the founder of KryptoWar, I had to talk about our work. Our game started as simple war game but is growing into something more complex where [players can purchase factories and schools](https://kryptowar.com/factories-schools/) to sell weapons and certifications to other armies. Our goal with [KryptoWar](https://kryptowar.com/) is to build a game completely decentralized so it felt like a great evolution to let players sell weapons to each other instead of getting them to purchase weapons from our smart contract. \n\nAt KryptoWar, we don’t use any side chain component. **All of the data that runs the game is stored on the Ethereum blockchain**. It’s great way to test the Blockchain and to create a completely decentralized experience.\n\nClosing Remarks\n---------------\n\nAs the world is becoming more aware and focused on Ethereum, we can expect the number of developers working on decentralized applications to continue grow rapidly. Even more, developing dApps themselves is also becoming easier with the release of tools like [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/), which have been largely successful in teaching developers to use Solidity and Web3js. Each of these apps represents a leap in the right direction for the building decentralized apps on the Ethereum blockchain. But it’s important to realize that this is just the beginning—and everyday, dApps are becoming increasingly more advanced. Soon, we will see larger-scale apps that have achieved complete decentralization.\n\n---\n\nI would love to hear your feedback about this article and your feeling toward recreational decentralized applications.

7sfswy,1516726799,"New Working Wallet DAPP: Protects you from losing your keys, from hackers and allows your family to claim your funds if you become incapacitated","**TLDR**: Here’s a [link](https://rexetblell.github.io/TrustWallet/wallet.html?wallet_address=0xdd91fa3b84b1080f3b618cbc47e06c57def689b9) to a sample wallet that is deployed on Mainnet. You need MetaMask in your browser to be able to view it. This wallet has some real Ether in it.\n\nI talked about this idea [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6dz1zs/a_new_type_of_multisig_wallet_for_safer_storage/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ipfmc/is_it_possible_to_put_someones_will_on_a_smart/dr0gq5l/) and it seems to have been well received.\n\nThe wallet should have several users, just like a multisig. The key idea is when a user initiates a transaction, she has to wait for some period of time before being able to actually execute it. This delay can be different for different users. A transaction can be canceled while it is pending (after it was initiated, but before it was executed).\n\nHere’s how to use the wallet practically. Add a key of your friend with a delay of 1 year. Add a key of some family member with a delay of 6 months. Add your hot wallet key (such as Metamask or Parity) with a delay of 2 months. Add your hardware wallet key (such as Ledger Nano S) with a delay of 2 weeks. Add your most secure key, such as a paper wallet and set the delay to 0. The idea is that the lower the security of the key, the higher the delay should be.\n\nIf one of the keys gets hacked, you can always cancel its transactions (and remove the key), using a key with with a lower delay (which means it has more privileges). You should keep an eye on the wallet from time to time to make sure there are no unexpected pending transactions in it.\n\nIf you forget some of your keys, you can still access your funds using your other keys. Even if you lose all of your keys, your friends/family can help recover your funds after a few months of waiting. If you become incapacitated, your family/friends can still access your funds.\n\nIt currently works on Both Ropsten and Mainnet. To create a wallet, select Ropsten or Mainnet in MetaMask and go to [this page](https://rexetblell.github.io/TrustWallet/), and click “Create New Wallet”. This will deploy a new contract. To test it out for free, switch to Ropsten in MetaMask. The gas fee to create a new wallet on Mainnet is around 1 USD if you set the gas price to 1 GWEI. [Here](https://rexetblell.github.io/TrustWallet/wallet.html?wallet_address=0xb78d3f1d81991f7ca3d45ec8051817469b6fb0c0) is a sample wallet that I deployed on Ropsten.\n\n[Here’s a wallet](https://rexetblell.github.io/TrustWallet/wallet.html?wallet_address=0xdd91fa3b84b1080f3b618cbc47e06c57def689b9) I created on MainNet. As you can see, the wallet has several active users. Each user has a different waiting time. Some users were removed. There are 3 executed transactions, 1 canceled transaction and 1 pending transaction. The pending transaction can be executed in about 8 months from now. [Here’s](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd91fa3b84b1080f3b618cbc47e06c57def689b9) a link to it on Etherscan. The wallet has some real Ether in it. Please try to steal it :) I am also offering a bug bounty. If you report a critical vulnerability in the contract, I’ll send you 0.5 ETH (this offer stands until June 1, 2018).\n\nThe source code for the factory contract (contract that deploys wallet contracts when users click “Create New Wallet”) is verified on Etherscan on both [Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x8948075ce42e656a83f76b9a3d0b53e8dc5c7a66#code) and [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x903db1bf91cc22964cccfbe1a1875eb3b989f32a#code)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7sfswy/new_working_wallet_dapp_protects_you_from_losing/,23,15

7sg15h,1516728558,What did I find out after researching 610 coins/tokens from EtherDelta: the overview,"It was like looking for a needle in a haystack, searching for a hidden gem. Taking part in an expedition to the interior of the Earth. \nWell, frankly speaking it was not; I and my team just researched more than 600 coins/tokens listed officially on EtherDelta.\n\n**What did we found out?** \n\nThat every second project was “the FIRST”, some of them where even “the FIRST AND ONLY”. After reading about 50 of them, I just thought that it’s funny. After reading 100 of them, I thought that maybe it’s because it’s a very small community with a low amount of projects (in comparison to all internet projects) and they are so focused on themselves that they don’t read about others. After reading 150 of “the first and only” I just had one question in my head: “who is this one vocabulary teacher who taught all people involved in cryptocurrency?” Don’t get me wrong - it was also my mistake when I joined a blockchain-based startup, I thought that everything we do were “the first and only” (and some of the things we did probably as the first; like first tokenized real object, an ikea rat, 1st of August 2017) but who really care if we did it as the first? \n\nOur excel sheets contained those fields: smart contract address, decimals, symbol, website, general token information, e-mail contact, medium, blog, Reddit, Twitter, whitepaper, GitHub, SlideShare, Facebook, telegram, video, linkedin, bitcointalk, Vkontakte, Instagram, discord, glitter, CrunchBase, chat, slack and others.\n\nAnd what are our conclusions? \n\n**a) Description of the project**\n\nI already know why Twitter was created: it’s the only way for startups to fit into 140 characters to explain their project. Sometimes it was really hard to understand what those projects are about, so if the claim didn’t say anything, we were searching for it in the whitepaper, twitter, sometimes Facebook or on Reddit. \n\n**b) Hello, it's me:  e-mail addresses**\n\nOnly 282 from 610 projects gave an e-mail address on their website. I don’t know that to think about that. I like to have an option; I like to know that there is a real person behind a project who will help me when I have a problem with a product. Don’t you?\n\n**d) Whitepapers**\n\nOnly 321 projects had whitepapers (or light papers). Is it okay or not? It was harder for me to to understand do I want to buy their tokens. But still: 321 from 610 is 52,6 % - so let’s say it’s a half of projects who resigned from informing their communities about their next steps, the vision, the background and so on. Well, we’re at the moment where anything can happen with crypto, so why not - there is no The 10 Commandments about crypto, no “official” standards, so everyone are choosing what is best for them, \n\n**e) social media:**\n\n* Medium 231\n* blog 58\n* own subreddit 238\n* twitter 452 (!!)\n* github 215 \n* slideshare 5\n* facebook 321\n* telegram 299\n* video/yt 185\n* linkedin 147\n* bitcointalk 298\n* instagram 20\n* discord 29\n* chat 11\n* others 63 \n* slack 81 \n\nall those above are per 610.\n\nThose data were really interesting for me! Look how many of those projects own a Twitter account: 452 of them! And only 215 of them have a github. I’m amazed how many of them (29) are using discord - it’s getting more and more popular concerning blockchain community - and not all of them were connected to gaming industry!\n\n**Why did we research those tokens?** \n\nWe were collecting a useful content for our (beta)platform for crypto-investors trivial.co where users can get information about different coins/tokens, you can check it here: \n\n**TOKENS**: If you would like to check for example ZRX- 0x tokens you can do that here: https://trivial.co/t/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498 (the number in the link is just a smart contract number of ZRX - you can check it with any different token on Ethereum blockchain).\n\n**ACCOUNTS**: If you would like to check the balance or tokens of any address - you can do that here: https://trivial.co/profile/XXX - where XXX is any account number. So basically it’s working like etherscan - we don’t collect any data, it’s always on users’ site.\n\nWe had to research each of them listed on EtherDelta manually, which means reading everything about those projects one by one, so we could get as much knowledge as possible on every token and team behind it. \n\nI don’t know if any token creator will update their projects’ websites with a good description, I know that researching those websites helped me a lot to find few tokens which I bought and will keep it for a longer time (I don't buy for trading, I decided to have less tokens but well researched and ""safe"").
