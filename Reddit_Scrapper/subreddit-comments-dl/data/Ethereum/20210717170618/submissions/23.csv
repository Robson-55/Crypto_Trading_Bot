7bu843,1510243429,How does proof of authority work?,"Hi guys,\n\nVeChain (VEN) has decided to go for a proof of authority (PoA) model and I was just wondering if someone could explain how the nodes on a PoA network work.

However, I wanted to add extra classes to my next term in order to learn more coding and programming. My question is whether I should take classes that focus more on programming languages such as Java and python or take classes that specify in web design and javascript. I'm not sure which route would be best to take in order to better understand Solidity. As a graphic designer  I am learning a lot of front-end design but now I want to extend my skills and learn some back-end coding and programming.

I've been digging into Rocket Pool for some time and really like what I've seen but wanted to get some feedback from future stakers. A lot of it requires technical knowledge that a lot of us in the community don't have. We understand the general topic but will probably not be willing to risk our ETHs if our solo setup isn't right. Therefore this pooling offer is appealing... Let me know what you think. Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bwoq0/staking_pool_or_not_with_casper_around_the_corner/,3,0
