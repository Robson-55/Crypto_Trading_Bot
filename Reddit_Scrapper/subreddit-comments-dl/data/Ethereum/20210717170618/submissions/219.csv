7ox5n1,1515399312,How fast can ethereum get?,"Hey i really like ethereum, but im asking myself how fast can it get? \nThe last months it often used to be really slow, especially when using not much gas.\n\nSo whats it technicsl max speed? Can it get faster? And why do so many big exchanges have big performence problems, while sending it from my wallet is pretty fast.\n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ox5n1/how_fast_can_ethereum_get/,8,13

Does it matter that I can never sync completely?\n\nI can also just use myetherwallet but I really wanted the official recommended desktop app to work. I don't want to disparage ether and I'm really glad that my ETH revaluates every day or almost every hour, but how do you expect widespread acceptance if the official app appears not to work?\n\nI hope this post doesn't get flagged as ""pointless"", and that someone can really explain if I'm doing or understanding something wrong here.\n\nThanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7oy3ns/mistethereum_wallet_doesnt_work_for_me/,3,2
