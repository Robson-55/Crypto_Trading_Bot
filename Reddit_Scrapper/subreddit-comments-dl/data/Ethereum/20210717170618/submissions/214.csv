7op7cx,1515308201,Lost all my ETH. Help my understand how.,"I recently created a wallet on MyEtherWallet.com in which I transferred some coins. Some of them I sent to Binance and Kucoin and some I intended to keep on the wallet. About 12h after the Kucoin  transfer someone transferred all the remaining coins in the my wallet to another wallet.\n\nEverytime I made a transaction I did it from my Android phone. The private key was kept in a 7zip    encrypted archive that was stored on my phone and a backup on a newly created Google Drive account.\n\nI know that the coins are lost forever but please help me understand how they stole in from me so that I don't make the same mistake twice.\n\nEdit: It was a phishing job guys. I browse through my Google history and I discovered that I accessed www.myethierwalliet.com at some point. It's very strange that the transaction went through even though it was a phishing site.\nThe ether address of the thief has a lot of messages from the people that got robbed also. \nPlease be very careful everybody, you can lose a lot of money by a simple mistake.\n\nThanks a lot to everybody for your help and sugestions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7op7cx/lost_all_my_eth_help_my_understand_how/,622,393

I've added 4 tokens. I can only see first 3. It says ""you own 4 tokens"" but the window limits the view to 3. Is there any way to expand the window further or somehow see other tokens I own?\n\n\nAnd sorry, additional question. I've accidently added the token I don't want to have anymore.
