Today I've checked and 70 TaaS is gone from https://etherscan.io/address/0x8F4d0B95EAA0043FE263843804B295e860c6dbdD#tokentxns\n\nto https://etherscan.io/address/0x700cee07ac5ef32bc2af762b10f5d85b97a55261 . \n\nHow did i fall into that trap and more importently, how do I not fall for this anymore? What pendrive system should I use? What wallet (at least to generate a new address)? \n\nEDIT: Can you tell me what does it mean that:\n\n22h33m ago I received from 0xf04b54748a707d9 to 	0x8f4d0b95eaa0043 (my address) 0.09 ETH which I know nothing of:\nthen\n22h26m ago I transfered from 0x8f4d0b95eaa0043(my address) to TAAS Contract (What does it even mean?)\nthen\n22h25m ago I transferred from 0x8f4d0b95eaa0043(my address) to 0x700cee07ac5ef32bc which I never had?\n\nThis is very disturbing because I kept only TaaS in that wallet and the only ETH I had was the dividend that I transfered out to a different address 2 days ago.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bn00e/ive_just_lost_70_taas_even_though_i_used_paper/,0,17

7bn7uu,1510165230,[Question] When will the ethereum blockchain become oversized?,"Hey there,\n\nThis might seem like a stupid question but I've had no luck finding an answer. \n\nThe ethereum blockchain (as I undersood) is replicated on each node of the network. That means that, at some point, the blockchain will grow so much that no single computer will be able to host it all. Is there any calculation on what that ""overflowing size"" is or what the strategy to deal with it will be?\n\nThanks in advance :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bn7uu/question_when_will_the_ethereum_blockchain_become/,2,15
