Recently there was either a metamask update or my browser updated, and metamask stopped showing the ""login/password"" screen and was instead prompting me to create a new account.\n\nAt the bottom of the new account there is an option to restore an old account with the 12 word seed phrase.\n\nI went and got my 12 word seed phrase from the hidden location where I had it written down. Unfortunately when i entered it, I was met with ""invalid seed phrase.""\n\nThis means 1 of 2 things is likely happening. 1) I originally wrote down the seed phrase wrong and one of the words is slightly off or mispelled. 2) there is currently some issue with metamask restore from 12 word phrase\n\nWondering if anyone out there has had this issue? or know of a way to fix? Is it possible to recover using other wallets with a metamask seed phrase. Brute force all possible similar words to what i have written down into metamask? Any help would be much appreciated..",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7flhxm/locked_out_of_my_metamask_despite_having_my_seed/,10,27

7fmnt3,1511699963,Is Ethereum Wallet + Trezor ready for use? x-post with r/TREZOR,"Hi,\n\nI saw this: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14885 so I have downloaded latest Ethereum Wallet 0.9.3 and geth 1.7.3. I have started geth first then Ethereum Wallet. Geth downloaded latest blockchain, while Ethereum Wallet insisted on downgrading geth to 1.7.2. I saw no option to prevent this, and after several tries and restarts I finally gave up, and now I have Ethereum Wallet 0.9.3 and geth 1.7.2 up and running.\n\nFirst I had to update my Trezor firmware so I went to website https://wallet.trezor.io/#/ to do this. The firmware is signed, and trezor checks the signature, so Trezor would warn me if wrong firmware was about to be uploaded. Also I had to stop geth, because geth would connect to the USB, thus preventing the website from connecting to the USB.\n\nThen I started geth and reconnected Trezor, and geth printed in terminal:\n\n    WARN [11-26|12:19:16] New wallet appeared, failed to open      url=trezor://.... err=""hidapi: failed to open device""\n\nSo I started in another terminal this command:\n\n    ./geth attach\n\nand I did type following command:\n\n    personal.openWallet(""trezor://...."")\n\nit asked for PIN, and my Trezor was ready for use. A command \n\n    personal.listWallets\n\nhas shown new wallet in Trezor, and also this wallet has appeared in Ethereum Wallet.\n\nSo then I tried sending 0.00001 ethereum back and forth between different accounts and it all on first sight appears to work very nicely.\n\nSo, is it ready for use and approved by developers of Geth and Trezor?\n\nAlso, how can I prevent Ethereum Wallet from downgrading my geth from 1.7.3 to 1.7.2 ? :)\n\n**TL;DR**: I did some testing and it seems to work. I want to be sure that it really works :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7fmnt3/is_ethereum_wallet_trezor_ready_for_use_xpost/,2,1
