7alm5z,1509736366,Thoughts on how to incentivize scaling research without ICOs,"The lack of incentive for basic protocol scaling R&amp;D may potentially lead to delays in the rollout of scaling features going forward. Currently a developer is more incentivized to develop and take a project to ICO which may not be the best idea for scaling upgrades as it may necessitate the addition of unneeded frictional elements for monetization purposes. Inspired by Vitalik's personal donation to fund [state channel research](https://medium.com/l4-media/generalized-state-channels-on-ethereum-de0357f5fb44), I propose the community forms a nonprofit DAO directed at providing supplemental funding for basic protocol/scaling research and development. \n\nThe DAO would be structured similar to the Slockit DAO (hopefully acknowledging that project's mistakes) however it would be strictly nonprofit with no expectation of monetary benefit from donations, and therefor shouldn't run afoul of security laws. Project chief scientists elected and charged with vetting proposals and developers, proposals submitted, and funding could be allocated to developers based on meeting development benchmarks via escrow contracts or similar instruments. \n\nThe idea is nascent, not fully developed, and I may be overestimating the usefulness/feasibility of funding scientific R&amp;D in this fashion as well as the philanthropic spirit of the greater community, but I think there's a lot of holders who understand the concept of planting the tree now as to enjoy its fruit down the road. A fully scaled and mature Ethereum will be the most valuable for everyone. Anyway just a thought and interested to see what the community thinks.
