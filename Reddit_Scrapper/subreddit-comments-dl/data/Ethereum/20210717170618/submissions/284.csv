7t0071,1516919680,Help with peer discovery in private Ethereum blockchain using geth,"Sorry if this is too specific/technical of a question to ask here. If anyone can recommend somewhere better to ask let me know. \n\nAt work we set up our own Ethereum blockchain internally to play around with. Each node is initialized with the same genesis block, and we are all using the same network id. Everything works fine if we add each other as peers normally. We can mine, create contracts, etc and everyone stays in sync. However, it seems like something isn't configured right because there is no automatic peer discovery. My understanding is that if I designate a node as a ""bootnode"" and start all other connections using the --bootnodes flag pointed at that node then it should bootstrap connections to all other nodes that did the same thing. However, when running admin.peers in the console we always only see the bootnode's id itself. No discovery is happening. Functionally this is fine so far, but I'm curious why the automatic peer discovery isn't happening.\n\nThe command we are using to start all nodes (including the bootnode itself) is:\n\n    geth --datadir ""~/Documents/Ethereum/privatechain"" --networkid 1235 --bootnodes ""enode://{nodeId_of_bootnode}@{bootnode_local_ip}:30303"" console\n\nAs a separate, potentially unrelated question. Is there any relationship between the ""chainId"" config param in the genesis block and the ""--networkId"" param used to start geth? My understanding is those don't have to themselves match, but all nodes have to agree on those values.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7t0071/help_with_peer_discovery_in_private_ethereum/,2,0

Why doesn't the massive amount of transactions slow down the network in the same way Bitcoin has been slowed down? I can understand that the volume of transactions might not be as large for the Ethereum network as for Bitcoin, but at some point it would have to get close right? Why aren't all these ERC20 tokens slowing down the Ethereum blockchain? I'm sure I'm running on bad assumptions here, any explanation would be awesome.

That is 20x the land holdings of their new neighbors (Tesla's Gigafactory @ 3,000 acres, Google @ 1,200 acres).\n\n* Tahoe Reno Industrial Center's [website](http://tahoereno.com/sites/) lists land price at $2.25/sf which would be ~$100,000/acre. This would be imply $6.5 billion paid, however if you compare to previous discounts (i.e. [Google's discount](https://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2017/04/17/google-buys-land-near-tesla-gigafactory-east-reno-data-center-technobubble/100566250/)) of ~1/4 of that, it's safe to say **$1 billion** is a ballpark number for the final price paid.\n\n* [Blockchains LLC's](https://www.blockchains.com/)'s apparently new website is rather barren, with no clear indication of what they actually do, except for running [ETHnews.com](https://www.ethnews.com/) and creating distributed apps on the **Ethereum** blockchain. Their [linkedin company page](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2211430130%22%5D) only shows 10 employees, led by a Jeffrey Berns (CEO) and David Berns (COO). Not to mention that ""Blockchains LLC"" sounds a lot like an impersonation company name.\n\n* David Berns is also the CFO of [Berns INC](http://www.bernsinc.com/), which ""creates software using blockchain-based technology."" Its a small company with only 9 people, 5 of which are developers. Most of the people working for Berns INC overlap with Blockchains LLC, and I wouldn't be surprised if Blockchains LLC is just a subsidiary of Berns INC\n\n* Jeffrey Berns and David Berns are also partners at [BernsWeiss LLP](https://www.law111.com/) law firm, which is a ""virtual currency class action practice""\n\nMaybe I'm not aware of these companies footprint on the Ethereum ecosystem, but to me its weird that a relatively unknown company has $1 billion cash to drop on *land only*, with no clear indication about what they're going to use it for besides 150 acres for a ""campus park that will house the company's headquarters"".
