7qz0ix,1516169101,Why is sharding so difficult to implement? Is my design impossible?,"Hi,\n\nI was thinking about scaling/sharding and thought of a rudimentary design. Keep in mind I am a complete blockchain noob.\n\nI know much smarter and experienced people have been working on this for years so I assume there must be drawbacks and difficulties that I can't grasp. I am trying to get a better understanding of this matter.\n\nWhat are the major difficulties in implementing a sharding algorithm for scaling? Is my design theoretically impossible/insecure? Or technically impossible to implement?\n\nThe way I see it, the design could work like this:\n\n##I. Basic Design##\n\n1. There is one main ethereum network that keeps track of all the Eth in the world: Let's call it the International eth network.\n\n2. Anyone can join this network like in today's implementation.\n\n3. Anyone can create a bridge contract to a new Etheremum blockchain (subblockchain): Let's call two of these USA, and France. \n\n5. This bridge contract is mirrored on both blockchains using the interblockchain transaction process described below and includes technical details on joining the new blockchain.\n\n6. Although the subblockchains are controlled by whoever joins them and are as such untrusted, the International blockchain only keeps track of a the total amount of eth available to that subblockchain. As such, it does not need to worry about the amount of eth each user of the subblockchain controls.\n\n7. Most miners/stakers on the subblockchain only validate local transactions (e.g USA-&gt;USA) and only need to keep a copy of the subblockchain.\n\n8. A specific type of miners/stakers can validate interblockchain transactions. To become an interblockchain miner/staker, they must do as follow:\n\n	A. Keep a copy of both the subblockchain (e.g USA) and the parent blockchain (e.g International);\n\n	B. Stake an amount of Eth (e.g 1000 eth minum) in the bridge contract, these stake being tied to their addresses on both blockchains (could be the same) by the contract.\n	\n##II. Blockchain-&gt;Subblockchain Transactions##\n\n1. Bob, a user of the International blockchain wants to transfer Eth to Alice, in the France subblockchain.\n\n2. Bob issues a parent blockchain transaction to the bridge contract with Alices's subblockchain address as metadata and transaction fees for both the international and local transactions. \n\n3. For convenience, the Ethereum protocol may now support addresses in a format such as [BridgeAddress].[AliceAddess] or with ENS (Ethereum Name Service) INTERNATIONAL.FRANCE.ALICE.\n\n4. From the perspective of the International blockchain the transaction amount is stored in the bridge contract (that will thus store all eth on the subblockchain). \n\n5. When the transaction to the bridge contract is validated in the parent blockchain, an interblockchain miner/staker is selected (e.g randomly depending on block hash or a process similar to PoS). The selected interblockchain miner/staker can only validate transactions of a ratio of his stake (e.g 1/1000).\n\n6. The selected miner/staker can issue a transaction on the subblockchain to Alice by triggering a function on the subblockchain copy of the bridge contract.\n\n7. From the perspective of the subblockchain miners/stakers, this amount appears from the bridge contract with no proof but they can trust it for the followoing reasons:\n	\n	A. The bridge contract validates that the miner/staker's stake is sufficient to create the transaction;\n\n	B. The parent blockchain transaction ID is included in the metadata for other interblockchain miner/staker to verify it;\n\n	C. If it is fraudulent transaction, interblockchain miner/stakers can activate a function of the bridge contract to eliminate the malicious miner/staker from both chains;\n\n	D. If more than 51% of them activate this feature, the malicious actor looses his stake and bridging privileges;\n\n	E. Because the staker can only validate 1/x of his stake, eth from his stake can be used to compensate/perform the malicious transaction. The rest of the eth can be distributed to all subblockchain users or burnt.\n	\n8. When operations on the bridge contract are made on the parent blockchain (e.g new interblockchain staker), they are reproduced on the subblockchain using a similar process except that interblockchain stakers capitalizing more than 51% of the total stakes must validate it on the subblockchain by calling a function in the bridge contract.\n\n##III. Subblockchain-&gt;Blockchain Transactions##\n\n1. Alice, a user of the France blockchain wants to tranfer Eth to Bob in the International blockchain.\n\n2. Alice issues a subblockchain transaction to the bridge contract with Bob's address in the parent blockchain as metadata (or with ENS International.BOB);\n\n3. From the perspective of the subblockchain, the transaction amount is destroyed.\n\n4. When the transaction to the bridge contract is validated in the subblockchain, an interblockchain miner/staker is selected (e.g randomly depending on block hash or a process similar to PoS). The selected interblockchain miner/staker can only validate transactions of a ratio of his stake (e.g 1/1000).\n\n5. The selected miner/staker can issue a transaction on the parent blockchain to Bob by triggering a function on the parent blockchain copy of the bridge contract.\n\n6. From the perspective of the International miners/stakers, this amount is taken from the bridge contract with no proof but they can trust it for the following reasons:\n	\n	A. The bridge contract validates that the miner/staker's stake is sufficient to create the transaction;\n\n	B. The subblockchain transaction ID is included in the metadata for other interblockchain miner/stakers to verify it;\n\n	C. If it is fraudulent transaction, interblockchain miner/stakers can activate a function of the bridge contract to eliminate the malicious miner/staker from both chains;\n\n	D. If more than 51% of them activate this feature, the malicious actor looses his stake and bridging privileges;\n\n	E. Because the staker can only validate 1/x of his stake, Eth from his stake can be used to compensate or recreate the malicious transaction. The rest of the eth can be distributed to all subblockchain users or burnt;\n\n	F. If the transaction is fraudulent and is still validated, it does not matter from a parent blockchain's perspective as the Eth is taken from the bridge contract.\n	\n##IV. Subblockchain -&gt; Subblockchain transactions##\n\n1. Let's assume the USA subblockchain now has a subblockchain called NYC.\n\n2. Alice, a user of the France blockchain wants to tranfer Eth to Kevin in the NYC blockchain.\n\n3. Alice will issue a transaction on the France subblockchain to the bridge contract with the routing information in the metadata:\n	\n	A. Kevin's address such as (with ENS) INTERNATIONAL.USA.NYC.KEVIN;\n\n	B. A transaction fee for each of the transactions involved in each of the blockchains: France, Interational, USA and NYC. \n\n4. Each bridge contract will relay the transaction according to the routing information.\n\n5. If the transaction fee is not sufficient at any of the subsequent transaction, Alice may loose her Eth, although a verification at the wallet and local bridge level may be performed.\n\n##V. Other considerations##\n\n1. If a user does not trust a subblockchain, he should not send any eth to that subblockchain's bridge, it is his own responsibility.\n\n2. The main blockchain does not need to hold any trust in any of the subblockchains.\n\n3. A 51% attack can be performed on any of the subblockchains if attackers gather sufficient stake. \n\n4. Trust in a subblockchain can be measured in the amount of stake in the bridging contract.\n\n5. When a bridging contract is created, it should be frozen until sufficient stakes have been gathered to prevent the first stakers from 51%ing each others.\n\n6. Only the main blockchain can create new Eth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7qz0ix/why_is_sharding_so_difficult_to_implement_is_my/,92,20

7qzn4t,1516177766,A smart contract that functions as a lottery...,"So a friend and colleague of mine were jokingly talking about the future of smart contracts and the differences between what Bitcoin and Ethereum can offer the world. Of course, we ended up in a small discussion on what weird things could be done as well and we jokingly talked about a lottery using Ethereum smart contracts. \n\nSo, we decided to do a little experiment. He wrote a smart contract that actually functions as an automatic lottery. You signup by sending an X amount of ETH, and when the lottery hits 1 ETH total or a 100 participants, 95% is instantly send to a random participant. \n\nWe thought it was pretty funny, but we actually want to give it a shot.\n\nSo here is a chance to win some Ethereum for those that are done trying to make a little bit of cash by trading all day. \nIt works as follows:\n\n1. Transfer some ETH to the address 0xE9D6db9563E1FFe38c4B2feC5Cd28C71ae44894f\n2. You are entered into the lottery with a 1/100 chance of winning the pot\n3. When the pot reaches 1 ETH, or the 100th person transfers ETH, the Lottery selects one of the participants and transfers 95% of the pot to the winner\n4. The pot and participants are reset and the lottery starts again, so your entry will never be lost, it will simply start the next lottery\n5. You can participate as many times as you like. If you are the only one to transfer ETH a 100 times in a single Lottery, you are guaranteed to win!\n\nHow would you game this system? (Or, how do you game this system? It's live...)\n\n*Edit*: Code to the Contract can be found at https://gist.github.com/anonymous/337a7cbb356ae4d898e891b206c1dc27",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7qzn4t/a_smart_contract_that_functions_as_a_lottery/,11,51
