Someone lost thousands of dollars in [XSS](https://hackernoon.com/how-one-hacker-stole-thousands-of-dollars-worth-of-cryptocurrency-with-a-classic-code-injection-a3aba5d2bff0) attacks. [Phishing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ethereum-phishing-attack-nets-criminals-15k-in-two-hours/) is widespread. Mist has had two ACEs because of bugs inherited from Electron and Webkit. There are a ton of zero-days hiding on all browser engines. And **while I was writing this post**, [""Parity Multi-Sig Wallets Deployed After 7/30 Issue""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bchez/parity_multisig_wallets_deployed_after_730_issue/). Then there's The DAO. Honestly, JS/GO-inspired languages such as Solidity are not suitable for writing smart-contracts that potentially deal with a lot of money. And I could go on and on, but, point is: **everything is terrible**. I've recently made a presentation at Devcon about the Moon Project, which aims to build a truly secure web that'd solve all those issues; yet, when I talk about things like formal verification, many still either don't care, or respond with a lot of prejudice. There are even influent people around who spread things like ""formal verification isn't an absolute solution for security"". (If a mathematical proof isn't, what else do you want?) I'd kindly like to ask a favor: if you've never written a proof, please refrain from opining on the subject!\n\nSo, on the subject. After The DAO hack, I've seen some efforts going in the direction of developing methods of formal verification, including formalizations of the EVM in Coq (Lem actually) and compiling dependently typed functional languages like Idris to it. While I think those are respectable, I don't think neither directions are leading us to a scalable solution. First, most of those cover either contracts or dapps separately, which is a mistake because both ends need to be secure. Second, running functional code on the EVM will never be practical for obvious gas-cost reasons. Third, Coq, Agda and the like are still arcane, academic tools that are way too frightening for the everyday developer. That makes it hard for me to see a long-term plan here. Are we just going to send our contracts to a few ultra-expensive ""theorem proving experts"" to ""prove"" them correct? Then what? Do we just **trust** [their witchcraft](https://i.imgur.com/215EzMW.png) that nobody understands? That doesn't look like it scales (on a human level, that is). What I think is necessary is: 1. make theorem proving much, much more friendly, 2. have a language that is actually practical (performant).\n\nOn (1), I hold the opinion that theorem proving is not difficult at all, and is only artificially made so by its community, due to a lot of academic jargon (and, sometimes, just because). I mean, Agda uses fucking unicode on its syntax, and can only be realistically written on especially configured EMACS! And [that's](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/CoqProofOfDecidablityOfEqualityOnNaturalNumbers.png) what Coq's IDE looks like on OSX, 2017 (do I need to say anything else?). They're not even trying to be friendly! What we need here is a language that is actually made for normal human beings; i.e., the Python of theorem provers. See what Elm did to functional programming, for example. That's what I'm aiming for future iterations of Moon. If theorem proving is made as simple as it honestly is, then *common programmers* will be able write and verify proofs, and that's when things will get interesting! I can easily imagine an ecosystem where proofs are copy/pasted as casually as code is today, and IMO that level of widespread demystification is what we really need to avoid future ""The DAO""s. (And if you're a programmer and that sentence didn't make sense to you, that just shows how unknowledgeable developers are about what a formal proof even is.)\n\nOn (2), it is also another fact that most functional programming languages operate on very abstract/high levels, and that makes them unpractical to work as 1. the backbone of a rendering engine (because of performance), 2. inside environments like the EVM (because of gas costs). I've been thinking a lot about those things for a long time and, thanks several insights from linear logic and its refinements, I think I'm very close to building a simple, functional core that not only can be massively parallelized (which allows it to run in a GPU, making it feasible as the backbone of a rendering engine), but can also run lazily on the EVM (with minimal gas costs). In fact, recent progress made me suspect that such a thing would beat ""CPU languages"" such as C and Rust on normal applications, but I can't promise anything yet. For a better insight on where I'm trying to get, check my repository on the [abstract algorithm](https://github.com/MaiaVictor/abstract-algorithm). I've also been thinking in how those things could be used together with zk-snarks and in some cases I suspect a chain of zk proofs / merkle-patricia roots could even replace Ethereum and the EVM themselves, but that's just a rough idea.\n\nSo, in short, I've been doing a lot of research on those areas and believe the answer lies there, but this community, as a whole, should be more respectful towards the field. Fortunately, The Ethereum Foundation has kindly supported me on this research, and I'll keep reporting results to the community. If you like those ideas, follow my posts as I'll be publishing a lot of advancements on the upcoming months.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bdm1g/so_can_we_again_have_a_talk_about_formal/,223,63
