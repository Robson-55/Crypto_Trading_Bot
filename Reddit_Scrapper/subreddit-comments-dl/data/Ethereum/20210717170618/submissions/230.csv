7pfshh,1515593422,Why is 8M gas causing so many uncles?,"Having just started testing the newest version of the parity client, executing a block with 8M gas takes about 120-130ms on my computer. The size of a block, if I interpret the output correctly, is about 35KiB.\n\nHow come that the increase from 6M to 8M caused such a spike in uncles? I thought the clients were at multiple seconds already, so that an increase in gas would be prohibitive either in duration or size.\n\nOr are the miners doing more work than parity is? I am aware they have to choose which transactions to execute as well, but that seems trivial. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7pfshh/why_is_8m_gas_causing_so_many_uncles/,61,57
