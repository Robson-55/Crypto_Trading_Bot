Help please!,"I'm trying to understand some things about smart contracts to see how they can be used for forecast-based financing (where climate events are forecasted, and money is delivered to people on the ground before said event takes place)\n\nSo, my questions are:\n\n1- Can you have a smart contract that releases funds to 1000 wallets? or do I need 1000 smart contracts with one destination each? \n\n2- How feasible is it to write a smart contract to deliver money to hundreds, or thousands of people given the current state of Ethereum/salary of developers/scalability issues etc?\n\n3- Can you automate the initiation of a smart contract (since one one needs to send gas to start it)? An organization with limited funds in an emergency couldn't realistically sit down and send gas to these things one by one.\n\n4- What is the problem with feeding real world data into a smart contract? Would the oracle be the humanitarian worker who has the final say (yes let's fund this project, or no)?\n\nEdit: edited to say thank you!!! if you are an environmentalist and a blockchain developer, please come talk to me!\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d587b/can_smart_contracts_have_multiple_targets/,1,5
