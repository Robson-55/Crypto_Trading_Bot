7dybks,1511065509,Looking to increase my wallet security while balancing backups,"Hi, \n\nI'm looking to improve the security of my ethereum wallet. Based on some reading, this is what I want to do...In general I am trying to balance security and keeping multiple backups (the latter of which I am more concerned about due to hardware failure etc)\n\n1.Generate a new wallet from offline MEW using a copy of ubuntu booted from a USB stick. Running off my main PC but with ethernet unplugged. Test with tiny transaction offline. \n2.Once validated, transfer funds from current wallet to one above.\n3.Only initiate transactions out of this wallet from the ubuntu live OS air gapped\n4. (and here is where I'm not sure) put copies of my json wallet for backup purposes on my NAS (which is encrypted but is part of my home network of course) and on a USB stick in a fire safe. I know these files are encrypted with your passphrase, but I've heard concerns about brute force attacks or key logging generally knowing your password (which if I only unlock via MEW on my linux stick should be okay I think) \n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7dybks/looking_to_increase_my_wallet_security_while/,15,7

7dztbg,1511086996,CRYPTOCARBON ERC20 coin London anyone heard of it,Got sent a link yesterday for cryptocarbon i had a look at it and seems very scammy but i wanted a technical opinion here are my findings so far\n1. No ico\n2. 70million coins premined\n3. 1 account holder owns 81% of all coins\n4. Its being heavily marketed almost like an mlm at seminars and events targeting ethnic minority communities across the uk who most who havent got a clue what an erc20 token is\n5. No proper exchanges list the coin however....\n6. A few shady exchanges also based in london whom only trade a few coins have listed it.. almost seems like these exchanges have been setup for  trading this cryptocarbon (ccrb) coin\n7. One thing i dont understand when you view the smart contract and token info on etherscan it shows a price on $0.28 per coin however i have no idea where this price is coming from\n8. Please can someone take a look at the smart contract and send some more info\nThanks,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7dztbg/cryptocarbon_erc20_coin_london_anyone_heard_of_it/,0,4
7dztht,1511087079,Separation of wallet and full node (in the context of atomic swaps),"I'm doing research into the design of a BTC&lt;-&gt;ETH decentralized exchange, and there's something that I need a bit of clarification on.\n\nOn the bitcoin side, this is being used: https://github.com/btcsuite/\n\nThe separation between full node and wallet is straight forward, and would allow users to participate without needing to run their own full node.\n\nHowever, I don't see how this works in ethereum. I know it must be possible because things like Metamask exist, which connects to a geth full node hosted by Infura.\n\nIf I wanted to run a full node, without any accounts on it, and let people send in their signed transactions (with web3), how would that be done? Is this how metamask works?\n\nAlso, the context of this question is wondering how this script  for atomic swaps interacts with ethereum: https://github.com/AltCoinExchange/ethatomicswap\n\nNo where in the code do I see private key management/signing of transactions. It just connects to an infura node.\n\nCheers",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7dztht/separation_of_wallet_and_full_node_in_the_context/,5,1

7e0yze,1511102672,"Synchronous, partially synchronous and asynchronous consensus algorithms","Could someone explain the practical difference between synchronous, partially synchronous and asynchronous consensus algorithms? \n\nThere might be some trade-offs but from my understanding asynchronous protocols rely on fewer assumptions about the underlying network and should be a better fit for decentralized protocols. E.g a fully asynchronous sharding scheme seems like the best way to scale out. \n\nAlso, dPOS schemes which at least involve partially synchronous protocols seem to rely on a limited validator count. Tendermint core (Cosmos) is limited to 100, the ""EOS cartel cloud"" only allows 23 validating nodes. So asynchrony also seems to be the key to real dezentralization as it should be.\n\nAdditionally all dPOS schemes i've seen so far have a deterministic process for selecting the next validator. This introduces new attack vectors since adversaries know in advance which validator/s will be responsible in the next round (ddos etc). In general strong randomness seems to be quite important as it keeps the network unpredictable for the adversary. \n\nSo... are asynchronous protocols which are build on strong randomness the holy grail?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7e0yze/synchronous_partially_synchronous_and/,33,6
