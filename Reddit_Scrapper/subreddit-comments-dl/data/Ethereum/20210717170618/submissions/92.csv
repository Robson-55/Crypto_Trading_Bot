7hn5tm,1512446729,Hard Spoon the Casper Testnet,"https://etherscan.io/chart/tx\n\nWe all know the first bottleneck of scalability is secure PoS and it will take some time to hammer out the details of the friendly finality gadget and the bonded PoS Casper protocol. However the main net is currently being overrun by kitties and this can only become more of a problem as time goes. Tomorrow might be Doges or numerai tournaments or augur prediction markets or stable coin management. To the point of eventually turning away good traffic to other networks. ICOs that have raised money on Ethereum and need to go live may have to launch on other language agnostic networks. I think there is an easy solution to the scalability problem right now that will also aid in experimenting with the tech in a live setting:\n\nHard Spoon the Casper Testnet.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nA hard spoon is when all current ETH balances are copied to a new chain, but state and history are discarded. In this case we would be talking a lean, mean experimental Casper PoS chain with the balance being derived from the main Ethereum chain at a specific block time. Early dapps that require throughput like Cryptokitties or Augur could be initially sated by deploying on the Casper version while assets/stocks/utility tokens can continue to be issued on mainnet Ethereum. Casper Ethereum would serve a similar purpose as Litecoin to Bitcoin, a value bearing testnet for the main chain.\n\nIt will allow faster experimentation (more tps and faster blocks) under a different ticker symbol. Casper Ethereum can experiment with hard and fast algorithmic tweaks and bonded PoS while the mainnet continues merging upgrades in a secure fashion with PoW only being removed once Casper PoS is formally secure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7hn5tm/hard_spoon_the_casper_testnet/,24,14

7ho5po,1512458964,Relax about the Cats!,"There's a lot of panic currently about whether or not Ethereum can scale if a cat game can bring it to it's knees. \n\nFirstly, let's assume Ethereum main net doesn't scale and the gas limit stays where it is. This will mean the gas price increases and Ethereum eventually becomes to costly for all but the use cases that can afford to pay more than the competing use cases. The market would decide what that is. \n\nSecondly, the gas limit will rise, there is some as yet unknown upper safe limit where the uncle rate is as high as the miners will tolerate. So there's still vooma in the engine as the engine is designed now. \n\nThirdly, there are several scaling plans in the pipeline. There's CASPER which will push up the safe gas limit significantly, as well as bring down the block times. There's Raiden for fast, cheap value transfer. There's Plasma, so the kitties can live in their own little universe. Then finally there's sharding which will scale things up significantly although the details are still sketchy. \n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ho5po/relax_about_the_cats/,1,1

7hoil2,1512464732,The need for on-chain scaling solutions,"With cryptokitties slowing down the Ethereum network, it got me thinking. There are many scaling solutions coming Ethereum's way - Sharding, Plasma, and Raiden. MicroRaiden is already here.\n\nBut if I'm not mistaken, sharding is the only on-chain scaling solution among those.\n\nIsn't it inevitable at some point in the future that, even if all the above scaling solutions have been implemented, there are countless DAPPs that fail to make use of them? Nothing is forcing a developer to offer a Dapp through Raiden. It may work better, sure, but maybe it wouldnt be necessary at first, and then spiral out of control from there (see cryptokitties). Or maybe the developer just didn't want to get acquainted with Raiden, or didn't think his Dapp would become successful, etc. etc.\n\nThe problem I see is that these badly coded/designed projects would impose a cost on the whole blockchain by bogging down the network, and by slowing down Dapps that legitimately don't make use of scaling solutions. Even simple payments would be slowed down because of ""bad"" Dapps.\n\nAs I also understand it, sharding alone can never be enough as a scaling solution.\n\nIs this a problem for Ethereum?\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7hoil2/the_need_for_onchain_scaling_solutions/,5,6

Also, in case of crash, you're left with hardware you can sell for extra buck. \n\nWhile staking rate IIRC isn't known, we're looking at 10% if I remember correctly, give or take. Ten times less profit annually, and if the market crashes, you're left with NOTHING.\n\nNot to mention that IIRC it was mentioned that you need 1000 ETH to stake. Sure, you can join others in a pool, but that of course means fees. So it's even less than 10% in the end.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong here but to me PoS seems just awful in comparison to PoW?
