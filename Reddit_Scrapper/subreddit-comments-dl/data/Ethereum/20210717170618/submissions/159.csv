7l9sfh,1513866676,Would appreciate your advice on a project I have been working on,"Hello, I have been working on a project about cryptocurrencies, Ethereum in particular. My goal is to explain what cryptocurrencies are and why they are so promising in a way that makes it easy to understand cryptocurrencies for someone who has never heard of cryptocurrencies before yet sophisticated enough to keep things interesting for people who have at least some knowledge of cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nThe most important part of this project is explaining the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, but I am not sure how to properly split this part up into smaller parts.\n\n\n\nI was thinking about splitting this part up into these (smaller) parts:\n\n-What is a blockchain?\n\n-What is m1ning* (POW)\n\n-Proof-of-stake (POS)\n\n-What cryptography is used to secure the network?\n\n-Smart contracts\n\n\n\nDo you think this covers everything someone needs to know to understand how cryptocurrencies work? Or am I missing something? And how would you split this part up into (smaller) parts?\n\n\n\nI appreciate all help.\n\n\n\n*Don't mind the 1, if I don't use a 1 it'll get removed by automoderator",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7l9sfh/would_appreciate_your_advice_on_a_project_i_have/,14,16

Etherscan shows the transaction is still pending confirmation with the time stamp continually resetting. It has been in the Ethereum block chain for upwards of 15 hours now.
