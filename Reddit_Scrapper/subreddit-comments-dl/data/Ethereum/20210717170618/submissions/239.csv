7pwnrm,1515764840,The Cipher Browser is a great app that gives you access to any dApp on you mobile phone (iOS only),"*I am the developer of a dApp named [KryptoWar](https://kryptowar.com), it's a war game based entirely on the Ethereum Blockchain. Today I want to spend some time to congratulate the team behind the [Cipher Browser](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cipher-browser-ethereum/id1294572970?mt=8), an app that can let you browse any dApp on your iPhone.*\n\n---\n\nAs a developer in the dApp ecosystem, it can be frustrating to see that many users don't have access to the tools (like [Metamask](https://metamask.io) or the Cipher Browser for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cipher-browser-ethereum/id1294572970?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cipherbrowser.cipher&amp;hl=en&amp;_r=1)) that could give them access to web3js and dApps in general.\n\nI recently downloaded the Cipher Browser and I was amazed by its quality. We had to spend some time to update [KryptoWar](https://kryptowar.com) to make it available to smaller screens but I'm delighted to know that mobile users can now user our Ethereum game if they download Cipher.\n\nFor those who don't know about it, it's basically Metamask for iOS. You can create or import your wallet and once it's done, you can start interacting with dApps.\n\n### Congratulations to the team behind this great app!\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7pwnrm/the_cipher_browser_is_a_great_app_that_gives_you/,60,22
