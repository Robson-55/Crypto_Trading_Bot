7qn3m9,1516052090,Strange tokens in my wallet.,"This weekend I was moving some of my tokens from my Jaxx wallet to my Ledger Nano S for safe keeping. During this process I had to spend some time on etherscan.io and noticed something odd, the tokens that I had bought (GNT &amp; CVC) were in the wallet but there were also some other tokens that I know for sure I never bought in there. There was a little bit of OMG, XNN &amp; VIU. I've never heard of Xenon or Viuly and I've heard of OmiseGO but I'm positive I've never bought any. Can anyone tell me how those coins got into my wallet? I assume that I am able to transfer them to my Nano S but I won't be upset if I can't.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7qn3m9/strange_tokens_in_my_wallet/,7,8

Well although I could still use a lot of help personally I thought I'd validate this idea of mine.\n\nThe basics of it would be, crowdfund equipment and property cost, build the miner, let it run, have it pay for electric and the rest would be monthly donations given to a school in need for the purchase of supplies, repairs, and so on.\n\nI'm abstracting a ton of details here but would like some agile feedback and knowledge on if anyone else is doing this.
