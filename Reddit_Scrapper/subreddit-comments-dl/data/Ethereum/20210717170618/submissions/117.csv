7j3eym,1513011045,How to ask sites to accept ethereum: what I did.,"So I was telling my kids how weird is the James Joyce's Ulysses novel.

Hey! Without a paywall, and a good read. I like that. I would have sent some ETH in their way, but they only accept credit cards and paypal. What a shame I thought to myself. So at the bottom of this site I found ""ask for help"" and I wrote to them this message:\n\n&gt; Hi, I  saw that you are asking for support. But you only accept paypal and credit cards. I would like you to put up front an ethereum public wallet address for donations. Then I will send some money in your direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have no experience whatsoever in handling cryptocurrencies I suggest that you just use https://trezor.io/ because it makes your cryptocoins invulnerable to viruses on  your computer, it's a bit expensive up front. There are other free-of-charge ways too: if you are confident that you have no viruses, you could just use an official ethereum wallet software, you will find links to those on official ETH blog: https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/10/12/byzantium-hf-announcement/\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks a lot!\n\nThen I realized that it is so general that you could use it as template to ask on other sites!

7j3pj7,1513013561,Explaining smart contracts to the layman is hard. Explaining cryptokitties is easy. Try it.,"I've always had a fascination with finding effective ways to explain difficult concepts, and for the past 5 or 6 years, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has been a huge focus of this fascination. Throughout this time, every conversation has been a learning experience for me, in what metaphors, stories, terms, and concepts most effectively illustrate why I and others are so excited about this technology. Traveling a lot, I meet new people often, and this allows me to rapidly iterate and improve my explanations. \n\nExplaining the importance of Ethereum, and therefore smart contracts, has always been difficult. I often say that it's like trying to explain the Internet before we had things like forums, eBay, and chat rooms: we are left with only vague possibilities on one hand, and the nitty gritty mechanics and protocols on the other. The former is too idealistic to be relatable, and the latter is too much mental work for all but the most focused listener.\n\nLately, I've started bringing up cryptokitties, and it's resulted in a pretty dramatic improvement. \n\nFirst, I bring up cryptokitties.co on my phone, so I have the cute pictures to show off. That's important. Then I explain the basic rules, something that takes only a minute or two: They are unique collectibles bought from other users (not from some company); you can breed them; they have hereditary characteristics; you can resell them or the offspring. I often stress the point that a user owns his cryptokitties with the sale level of security that one can own Bitcoin.\n\nPeople love it. Even if they think it's silly, or aren't personally interested in participating, they seem to quickly grasp that **this is a new kind of game which uses money and economic principles in ways that simply isn't possible with old money.**\n\nAnd isn't that, right there, exactly what we've been trying to explain the whole time? While crypto can indeed outperform traditional money in traditional roles, the truly exciting part is what it can do that regular money is fundamentally  incapable of.\n\nAfter showing people cryptokitties, I often say something like ""this is the kind of thing you simply can't create with credit cards or banks. This is why crypto is exciting.""\n\nI don't need to explain Solidity or even mention smart contracts. I don't need to explain mining. All I really need to do is explain the concept of (to paraphrase the cryptokitties team) ""virtual Beanie Babies that you can breed"".\n\nI think this is wildly significant. I don't think it's a stretch to say that cryptokitties is the first of the killer apps.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7j3pj7/explaining_smart_contracts_to_the_layman_is_hard/,29,6
