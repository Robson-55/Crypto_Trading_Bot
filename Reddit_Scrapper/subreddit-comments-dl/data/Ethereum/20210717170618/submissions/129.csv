7jm1vp,1513196597,Ethereum Smart Contracts for E-commerce and Physical Products,"I was talking with some friends about smart contracts the other day. We are by no means knowledgeable, but we loosely understand how an Ethereum smart contract could be used to facilitate a transaction of digital items/ownership of items. For example, I can imagine how trading a house ownership rights for ETH could work in smart contract form. \n\nThat got us thinking, would it be possible to use an ETH smart contract for shipped goods? For example, could Ethereum smart contracts be used to facilitate trade and prevent scamming on an DApp Ebay equivalent?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7jm1vp/ethereum_smart_contracts_for_ecommerce_and/,1,1

7jnlg3,1513209032,PSA: PrivCon has extremely high potential for being a scam,"I want to first say that:\n\n1) I have absolutely nothing to gain by warning people about this.  I'm not working on any competing projects, but I do wish for a secure Ethereum mixer service.\n\n2) I am **by no means saying this is an active scam.**\n\nFull disclosure - I'm a mod at /r/ethereumnoobies and /r/cryptoguides and really hate seeing people lose their funds to scams.\n\nI'm including screenshots of relevant material to avoid future edits or deletions.\n\nFirst half of thread: https://i.imgur.com/BKYA2Xx.png\n\nSecond half of thread: https://i.imgur.com/tHhtkI1.png\n\n---\n\n# Primary concerns\n\n• The service has not had a formal security audit, and it hasn't been considered yet\n\n• The mixer is not smart-contract based, not trustless, not open-source\n\nRather than address why these decisions were made, /u/PrivCoin justifies them with ""many entities in the crypto space are not trustless"", which I find directly in opposition to the spirit of cryptocurrency, anonymity, and security.  \n\nWhen asked about the fact that there is zero information about who is actually behind PrivCoin, what measures are there to hold the project accountable, and what keeps the people behind the project from breaking their privacy policy, the response was:\n\n&gt; Absolutely nothing. While distrust is prudent in this space, sometimes people actually do provide a service that does exactly what they say it will. We're one of those services.\n\n&gt; We've been open 3 months and are fairly high ranked on Google for all related terms. If we were scamming people then you'd know by now.\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, this equates to: ""you have no reason to trust us, but you should anyway because there are other *unnamed* projects out there like us, and that guarantees that we're legit.  Our *extremely short* 3 month record and google popularity basically proves this.""\n\nPeople are free to use whatever service they wish, but I cannot in good conscience recommend or support this service, primarily due to the stance on trustless services and poor justification of decisions I consider to be deplorable, not because there is a high potential for this service to walk away with user's money (which there absolutely is).\n\nPlease do not support projects like this.  Regardless of whether or not PrivCoin is or ever will be a scam, it sets a terrible precedent for the space when users do not demand the absolute best in security practices.
