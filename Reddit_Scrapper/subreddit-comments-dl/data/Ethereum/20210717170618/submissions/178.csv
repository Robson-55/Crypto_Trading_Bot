7mg31w,1514392961,Plasma and fraud proofs - possible to skip block headers?,"I know that submitting all block headers in sequence is enough to run a plasma chain (or BTC-relay) but is it possible to *skip* headers or submit them in a compact way?\n\nIf not, is there another way to make plasma chains with fast block times feasible (both from a cost and timing perspective) to connect to the mainnet?\n\n**Edit:** After consulting the plasma paper it seems I have confused plasma with the BTC-relay-like thing BankEx is building. Their repo is named ""plasma"", but it seems different than what was outlined in the plasma paper. Anyway, this question is in the context of their implementation: https://github.com/BankEx/PlasmaETHexchange/blob/master/contracts/PlasmaParent.sol#L491\n\nYou'll notice that they are requiring consecutive headers in order to form a merkle proof. This ensures they can verify a transaction occurred based on the blockchain state at the time of the transaction (which means they need the history, which is represented in the form of headers). My question is whether you can store that history in a more compact way. Saving headers from a fast sidechain onto the main chain is likely going to be very expensive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mg31w/plasma_and_fraud_proofs_possible_to_skip_block/,8,7

7mgauc,1514394982,"Ethereum Parity Fast Sync/""Warp"" Not Working","Hi, I am new to cryptocurrency and decided to buy $10 worth of Ethereum. I used Coinbase to facilitate the transaction. I have my hash number with my value stored but I have no way of accessing or using my money because Parity is taking forever to sync with the blockchain. \n\nThe longer it takes, the slower it gets it seems. I've already calculated this will take weeks to catch up at its current rate. I have an excellent internet connection and pretty fast computer. I tried Ethereum Wallet only to find out it was no better- both are slow as hell. \n\nI have even tried the --warp command, switched to a SSD drive, etc. Still painfully slow.\n\nWhen it comes to online finances, I'm used to making an account and being ready to rock within minutes. \n\nIs the weeks and months it takes to initially sync really the norm for using cryptocurrency? How is cryptocurrency even practical if this is the reality of it? Do I really have to spend weeks/months at the mercy of a bogged down computer, processing blocks at a snails pace, to finally just see my stupid little $10 in ether balance show up in my wallet?

7mgzpq,1514401280,CryptoKitties is good for Ethereum,"I have been in ETH a long time and other than the DAO (and yes we all know how that ended) have never been more excited about the future of ETH since after seeing CryptoKitties. \n\nBefore if someone where to ask me how ETH is useful I could site concepts like DApps and smart contracts and ICOs etc but what I was describing to them never really felt REAL. As stupid as it sounds CryptoKitties feels REAL. The game elegantly demonstrates both the value of digital scarcity as well as the vast potential of smart contracts in a way that is simple and intuitive. After trying it out for just a few minutes I was suddenly able to imagine dozens of new possibilities for the potential uses of ETH. You could raise virtual race horses and have them race against each other with randomized weighted outcomes and people could make bets and watch the races. You could keep actual Pokemon created by Nintendo and have them battle each other on a world wide arena. You could setup virtual shops in digital worlds like Second Life and sell the products and services directly for ETH. And this was just off the top of my head in like the first 5 minutes. \n\nCryptogaming has the potential to emerge as a whole new genre of gaming where the stakes and outcomes of each game can be linked to something real. As always, I understand there are definitely infinite ways to screw this all up but nonetheless it is exciting to see it in its inception.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mgzpq/cryptokitties_is_good_for_ethereum/,124,35
