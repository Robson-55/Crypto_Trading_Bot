7vmr2g,1517916904,Is Real Life Research possible with Ethereum / other crypto possible ?,"If we go past the price, lambos and moon discussions, I wonder if this is possible to do with either Ethereum or another cryprocurrency:\n\n- Real life research that uses computer power to solve problems and would give a token in exchange ( just like PoW mining ), but it will also have real life utility and be stored on a blockchain \n\n- Real life research that uses human mind to solve puzzles. Raiblocks (NANO)used to ask people to solve captchas and it became a worthy currency. I'm talking about projects like Eve Online had/have: Project Discovery: Human Protein Atlas and Project Discovery: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Project_Discovery\nSo basically this would be a mix of what Raiblocks and Eve did and would reward a cryptocurrency for solving the puzzle. Once again, this should have real life application, not just be an useless captcha puzzle and the results should be stored on a blockchain.\n\nWhy would anyone want this and why would it be a good idea ?\n\n- Pretty much every important discovery made by a lab / university / centralised organisation is kept under secret for quite a while, until they decide to monetize it ( for huge amounts of money that the users/citizens are paying). Storing it on a blockchain would solve the secrecy problem\n- Speed up innovation: there are never enough researchers, as it takes dozens of years to become a top one. If this job could be converted into puzzles that an average IQ person could solve and earn crypto at the same time, it would be the equivalent of hiring hundreads/thousands of new researchers\n- Domains like medicine, biology, physics, space exploration would always be in need of a such system, so the ""puzzles"" would never run out, once a previous problem is solved.\n\nDo you think this would be possible within the crypto world ? It would deffinitely put crypto into a much better light and also help the mankind as well in the process. Vitalik Buterin posted a series of tweets in December 2017 about the amount of problems solved by crypto and the final answer/conclusion was ""not enough"" (which was and still is correct)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7vmr2g/is_real_life_research_possible_with_ethereum/,17,5

7vo6hm,1517932015,Blockchain games as technology showcase? Good or Evil for Ethereum?,"The strong point of blockchain is trust and public control, and therefore the strength of Ethereum smart contracts is that they can be applied in areas where strong trust is necessary: voting, trading, and so on. This definitely should work, but is not getting a lot of traction at least so far, especially for the general public. \n\n\nThen there are games. On the one hand, games does not equal gambling. On the other hand, since blockchain allows convenient transfer of value, and any transaction has a cost, blockchain games that don't involve transfer of value just make no sense. Why do people play [CryptoKitties](https://cryptokitties.co)? Because they like playing breeding cats and paying for that? Hell no, that's because they want to get an expensive cat and likely sell it. Playing for money? That's the definition of gambling. Investment gaming? Investment gambling? But that was what got people to use Ethereum more, it got MetaMask more popular, that's a real application and that's generally good. So is it Good or Evil at the bottom line? \n\n\nHere's another example I ran into: [etherjack.io](https://etherjack.io/). They made an intricate penny auction on Ethereum. Looks like a casino, but if you read the rules, it's actually a trustless penny auction. They are collecting ether for the prize fund, and are going to launch as soon as it's collected. Gambling? Kind of, like everything else.  \n\n\nThey used blockchain to solve the problem of non-transparent and rigged penny auctions. I'm sure when they finally get that prize collected and actually start the game they will make some hype and attract new people to use Ethereum and actually perform some transactions and see how it works. Good or Evil? \n\n\nProjects like this highlight the power of smart contract: when coded right, people can trust value to a piece of software, and be sure it delivers on the promise, and nothing can be rigged. This never was the case in real life where it's easy to use power and influence to obscure anything no matter how big it is. On the blockchain it's the opposite, every small detail is public. \n\n\nIs games (involving playing for value) what will make Ethereum mainstream (Good)? Or will all those projects create a bad public image to it (Evil)?\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7vo6hm/blockchain_games_as_technology_showcase_good_or/,225,81

It would be ideal to have multiple monitoring nodes that could report whether a network link between one node and a server was down or if the server was actually down. I figure the best way to keep track of the nodes would be to build an application integrating a private Ethereum blockchain.
