7pam4a,1515534845,Fun thought: What if we had 2 mainnets that get consolidated with PoS.,"**Disclaimer**: I am pretty sure, there is a big problem with this idea that I cannot see, because probably smarter than me people would’ve come up with it by now. Can you please point it out to me? (And be nice please)\n\nThis idea is a temporary scaling solution. Instead of having one mainnet, we double the capacity by:\n\n1. Introducing a new mainnet\n2. Decrease the difficulty (probably by half?) for mining a new block\n\nThe EF announces that at block X there will be a new mainnet that is a complete copy of the other one. After that block, miners can switch and mine whichever mainnet they prefer. Naturally they will arbitrage between the two given the mining reward per difficulty ratio.\n\nAnother form of arbitrage will happen with the dApp developers. They will choose which mainnet to “upload” the dApps too. Naturally they will choose the less utilised mainnet because the users will have better user experience. Also, they can just upload to both if the cost of running a smart contract is not an issue giving the option for the users to decide which mainnet they want to interact with.\n\nLastly the users can choose which mainnet to interact with. Naturally they will gravitate towards the one with the lesser fees essentially arbitraging the fees.\n\nI am fully aware that introducing a new mainnet will introduce another layer of complexity for the users. However in most cases it can be abstracted away. For example, services like metamask, already allow you to switch between mainnet and testnet.\n\nThe consolidation.\n\nThis is the tricky part (and probably where the whole concept will collapse)\n\nThe EF announces that at block Y the consolidation will happen. If you owned 10 ether at one address on MN1 and 0 ether at the exact same address at MN2 - you get 5 ether when the consolidation happen. This is only necessary if keeping the ether at 100 m is important.\n\nIf you have a crypto kitty at address MN1 and another crypto kitty at the same address at MN2… guess what… you have both kitties at the same address when the consolidation happens.\n\nCurrencies are added together and halved, assets are just added together.\n\nLastly, I am sorry if this whole post was stupid for some reason. I am fairly technically knowledgable, but I am not a blockchain expert.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7pam4a/fun_thought_what_if_we_had_2_mainnets_that_get/,0,3

7panah,1515535112,Token and Crowdfunding smart contract creation - Guidance,"I am exploring to create ERC23 (I read that it is better than ERC20 and also backward compatible) compliant token and crowdfunding smart contract to kickstart my company's transformation to blockchain. My company work in areas like Human Resources, Recruitment, Talent Acquisition, Background checks and on-boarding. \n\nWhat are the secure and cost-efficient ways to implement? I have development background on microsoft suite of technologies (C#, SQL, Azure), HTML, JavaScript but not much exposure on blockchain. Although, I have gone through several resources online to learn about ERC23/20 protocols, solidity, various test nets, simple smart contracts etc. \n\nI am exploring EtherParty too but I believe, they don't have production version available until late 2018. And also, I have no idea how much FUEL will be needed to create token and smart contract and whether it will be hack-proof. Are there any other better platforms out there which provide wizard-like feature to create contracts?\n\nI can try creating something on my own but will not be able to properly test and audit from security point of view. I am most concerned on security and investor's stake as I have heard quite a few ICOs' security disasters.\n\nLooking forward for any valuable insight on this forum.
