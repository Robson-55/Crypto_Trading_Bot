7mtz9t,1514549547,"Guys, we have to fix the empty contract black hole bug.","Yes, I consider it a bug.\n\nIn the past few months, I've accidentally sent ether (thankfully only ~1 ETH) into empty contracts via human error on the command line. I'm happy to admit (under this anonymous account...) and explain how they happened to illustrate how easy it is.\n\n**ONE Ghost carriage return**\n\nEvery time I move funds from my cold wallet, I reinstall Linux from scratch and sync the blockchain new to make sure I'm working in a clean environment. Because of this, I don't have any geth history. So have a USB with common commands on it (edit: because I don't use the web on this clean machine).\n\nSo after loading linux, updating, upgrading, installing geth and waiting a while for sync, I loaded my cold wallet and unlocked it. Then, I went to my notepad with the common commands and copy/pasted the sendTransaction line. \n\nThis line had an extra carriage return on the end of it, so the command executed immediately from eth.accounts[0] to eth.accounts[1]. Guess who didn't have an eth.accounts[1]?\n\nWomp womp.\n\n**TWO Simple human error**\n\nSame situation as above; copy/pasted this line into the console, this time without the carriage return.\n\n&gt; web3.eth.sendTransaction({from:eth.accounts[0],to:eth.accounts[1],value:web3.toWei(0.0111,""ether"")});\n\nOk great. Now to put in the address I really want to send to...\n\n&gt; web3.eth.sendTransaction({from:eth.accounts[0],to:eth.accounts[""0xabc123fffffffffffff...""],value:web3.toWei(0.0111,""ether"")}); // NEVER USE THIS\n\nStupid mistake, right? But it happened. Thankfully, I know better than to send a large amount on first try, but losing almost $100 down a hole sucks (0.0111 was just an example), and you can bet your ass someone will make a much worse mistake. \n\nAnyway, we tell people ""don't use exchanges... control your own funds"" but I'm not sure I support that sentiment right now considering how bad the UX around wallets is. Isn't this fixable?\n\nVery interested in a solution to this problem.\n\nEdit: Just because I was curious: the 0x000000 account now has &gt; $7 million dollars in it. (Note: My mistakes resolved to some random addresses, not 0x0000.)\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mtz9t/guys_we_have_to_fix_the_empty_contract_black_hole/,5,21

7mu0xl,1514550232,Newb Question: Are Ether and the various ERC20 tokens based on Ether in competition with each other in terms of both value and functionality?,"One thing i'm having a hard time getting my head around after doing my own research is how ERC 20 tokens effect Ether in terms of value and functionality. For example, over on /r/ethtrader right now (as of the time i posted this) there's a thread pointing out how 88 of the tokens in the top 100 of Coin Market Place are all Ethereum tokens.\n\nIn terms of valuing the various cryptos against each other. Being that all those tokens are based on and operate on the Ethereum platform. Does this mean that tokens are an extension of Ethereum while also competing with Ether at the same time?\n\nIs it kind of like a feedback loop where the success of Ether/Ethererum trickles down to new tokens, that then go on to collectively feed Ether's value, which then trickles back down to all the tokens causing an increase in value which then adds more collective value to Ether and so on and so forth? Would an ERC20 token surpassing Ether on the top crypto lists in value hurt Ether or bolster it?\n\nIn terms of functionality. What are these tokens to Ether? I know Ethereum is the overall ecosystem of apps and currencies. Ether is the main currency that powers Ethereum. I know Ethereum provides the network with which DApps run. So why within individual DApps do they need their own sub-currencies when underneath the hood they're all already running on Ether/Ethereum? Are they each vying to at some point replace Ether as the crypto that powers the ecosystem?\n\nOn the surface level to me, being inexperienced with this stuff, it comes off like if Apple had their app store and they required people to spend fiat to buy AppleCoin to buy apps but then Apple also required you to use the AppleCoin to buy each individual apps in app currency. For example, buying the Angry Birds app requires trading AppleCoin for the fictional sub-currency, Angry Bird Pellets. What reason is there that i can't just spend AppleCoin store wide? \n\nDo i have my understanding of all this wrong? Also, sorry if this is the wrong place for this question. I figured even though i'm partially asking about value (more along the lines of r/ETHtrader, it'd be better to ask here since i'm also asking about how the tech functions too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mu0xl/newb_question_are_ether_and_the_various_erc20/,1,1
