7kr0mn,1513659061,"My Gemini Exchange account was compromised and someone stole over $11,000! HELP!","I have had 23 outgoing transactions to the same address that were unauthorized. The total is about 12ETH.\n\nAll of my stolen funds were sent to ""0xdfdf556622e83f0097e56653123ca6e35f07929b"". There is also some stuff tied to that wallet that i didn't do. I'm assuming those are more stolen funds, but everything in the past 7 days was from my account.\n\n10 days ago my password looks like it was compromised (I don't know how). There were a number attempts to access my account from multiple IP's. It happened on 12/08/17. I received 37 login attempt emails within a very short period of time. My phone was flooded with 2 step text verification codes. I changed the password after that, and thought i was secured. \n\nI have been loading my wallet with money all week from another exchange.\n\nToday I noticed the transactions because I received multiple emails about them. I had not received any emails about other transactions prior to today. They seem to have been deleted from my inbox which is an iCloud email. (unless they weren't sent). I assume my email was compromised as well and change the password on that.\n\nI also had not been receiving any text messages in the past week other than iMessage. I thought this was odd and have discovered that someone called into ATT trying to gain access to my account. According to them my text messages were forwarded. I have locked my ATT account- which was used for two step on Gemini. I have not initiated any outgoing transactions past 12/08/17.\n\nI filed a police report with my local police department and sent that to Gemini! \n\nI also have reason to believe my computer is compromised by some kind of remote access malware- I have been seeing the cursor move on its own in the past week. I have left it open for periods of time where I left to go do something, and it's been on totally different windows when I came back. I'm going to format this laptop and change my passwords again.\n\nWhat are the next steps I need to take? I'm missing a LOT of money- I also would preferably like to see someone in jail if possible. How can I get my money back from Gemini? I've already reached out to Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss on twitter. Gemini has told me they forwarded all of this info to their ""security department for review"". What are the chances I get my money back without having to sue them or file complaints with their regulatory overseers?\n\nBest,\nNick\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7kr0mn/my_gemini_exchange_account_was_compromised_and/,10,88

7ks2tv,1513673458,The need for a larger adoption of checksummed Ethereum addresses,"Currently Ethereum addresses only provide a very weak and now widely adopted checksum mechanism based on the capitalization of certain letters in the Address (for more information see [EIP-55](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md)).\n\nAfter analyzing all Ethereum addresses used up to now one can find over 1700 address pairs with a [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) of 1 or 2, meaning that two addresses only differ by 1 or 2 characters.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* [0x2c3d1159683c2fd430618a4cba3**b**18501692efca](https://www.etherchain.org/account/2c3d1159683c2fd430618a4cba3b18501692efca) and [0x2c3d1159683c2fd430618a4cba3**d**18501692efca](https://www.etherchain.org/account/2c3d1159683c2fd430618a4cba3d18501692efca)\n* [0x2c67c6d17f01264e635f2bb73**0**b88867156e9ba**b**](https://www.etherchain.org/account/2c67c6d17f01264e635f2bb730b88867156e9bab) and [0x2c67c6d17f01264e635f2bb73**b**88867156e9bab**0**](https://www.etherchain.org/account/2c67c6d17f01264e635f2bb73b88867156e9bab0)\n* [0x2fe35d2a3ed00eb2b2a4301e360a96700924c**28**a](https://www.etherchain.org/account/2fe35d2a3ed00eb2b2a4301e360a96700924c28a) and [0x2fe35d2a3ed00eb2b2a4301e360a96700924c**82**a](https://www.etherchain.org/account/2fe35d2a3ed00eb2b2a4301e360a96700924c82a)\n\nThis means that on average 1-2 users per day loose ETH due too mistyping their Ethereum address.\n\nAs of now most exchanges and wallets already use the checksummed address format but often still allow users to send or withdraw to non-checksummed addresses. Here it would be especially important to make the user aware that he is sending to a non-checksummed address and recommend switching to the checksummed version. As an example [MyEtherWallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/addresses/not-checksummed-shows-when-i-enter-an-address.html) already warns the user if he tries to send to a non checksummed version.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ks2tv/the_need_for_a_larger_adoption_of_checksummed/,84,34
