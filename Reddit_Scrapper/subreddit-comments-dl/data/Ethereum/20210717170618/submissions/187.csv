7n4v64,1514676105,Correcting r/bitcoin's misinformation: I just fully verified the entire ethereum blockchain on a 2+ years old desktop and it only took 25 hours (full log included),"In a recent [r/bitcoin's thread](https://archive.is/hUC59) /u/thieflar claims that with 'a very nice machine' he was unable to finish validation of the ethereum blockchain and that the near impossibility of it is apparently an accepted fact even among ethereum's developers:  \n\n&gt;The developers of Ethereum know that this is an issue, they are fully aware that their network relies on trust at this point, and they don't even try to deny it.\n\n/u/nullc comments with:\n&gt;without being able to count on nodes verifying the history even ethereum seems unable to make a proposal complex enough to hide its insecurity. \n\nI tested the truth of these statements - the result: **full block-per-block syncing completed in 25 hours 25 minutes.**  \n\nSoftware:  \nParity at commit 2586eaef929cadcd5ebccdf2d484f1cf6bb14917, compiled with ""target-cpu=native"", performance options: --tracing off --cache-size 4096  \nUbuntu 16.04\n\nHardware:  \ni7-6700K, 16GB ram, Samsung 850 EVO 256GB. Not bad but definitely not 'very nice' either.  \n\nTo remove the network speed from the performance equation I downloaded the bare blockchain separately and synced the node from disk. As it's only 20GB at the moment there would be no noticeable difference.  \n23k most recent blocks were downloaded after that. \n\nThe fully synced node with all historical blocks + recent state (ie. exactly like a full bitcoin node) uses 44.3GB.  \n\n---\n[Parity log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nootropicat/ethnodebenchmarks/master/parity_log.txt). \n\nSyncing from disk:  \n2017-12-30 20:15:50  Import completed in 87903 seconds, 4803128 blocks, 54 blk/s, 112578528 transactions, 1280 tx/s, 5273835 Mgas, 59 Mgas/s\n\nDownloading the tip:  \n2017-12-30 20:33:53  Syncing #4803139 d21c…7352     0 blk/s  115 tx/s   5 Mgas/s      0+   19 Qed  #4803162    5/25 peers   365 KiB chain 72 MiB db 2 MiB queue 898 KiB sync  RPC:  0 conn,  0 req/s,   0 µs  \n...  \n2017-12-30 21:33:43  Syncing #4825928 b3cb…6ec9     4 blk/s  720 tx/s  29 Mgas/s      0+   15 Qed  #4825945    7/25 peers   305 MiB chain 609 MiB db 3 MiB queue 3 MiB sync  RPC:  0 conn,  0 req/s,   0 µs  \n\n**Conclusion: any pc that can run a modern game can easily fully sync (no state snapshot downloading, only blocks) and run a full ethereum node.**  \n\n\n^^^edit: ^^^apparently ^^^reddit ^^^immediately ^^^deletes ^^^posts ^^^with ^^^links ^^^to ^^^mega",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7n4v64/correcting_rbitcoins_misinformation_i_just_fully/,1464,287

I tried to make a post of this on r/cardano but my thread was hidden (Mods?), thread is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/7n76u5/where_are_the_billions_of_ada/\n\nBut to copy/paste the message:\n\nSo total circulating coins for ADA right now is 25 billion. With that kind of large number of coins, I expect to see at least a few million coins being traded at once. For example, if you take a look at DOGE, they have 112 billion coins and you can see hundreds of millions (maybe in the billions too) range of coins being traded at once, at every buy and sell wall.\n\nI mean right now for example as I type this, there is a buy wall for 136,673,325 Dogecoins at 56 sats. That's over 100 million in just one trade. Throughout just a day there's well over a billion dogecoins transacted at once.\n\nWith ADA, I literally just see a few thousand being bought and sold. I mean are there all the billions of coins just being hoarded or stashed or what? There's basically 1 million coins going around, and 24.99 billion being stashed away?
