7t81ko,1517003953,I need your advice! Is this going to far?,"Okay, so I've heard of some pretty crazy stories about how people secure their recovery phrases, private keys, etc. Maybe I got caught up in it all, but let me know what you think!\n\nSo today I copied my Nano Ledger S recovery seed into a large dictionary--putting each of my recovery word's corresponding number next to its counterpart in the dictionary, essentially creating a lengthy puzzle and scrabbling my recovery phrase across a few hundred pages!\n\nWhile ingenious in theory, what follows may be taking things a little to far. I then took the dictionary with me to the bank and opened a safety deposit box where it now sits idle, waiting to be taken out in case my Ledger becomes lost or stolen.\n\nI invite you to tell me what you think and how you secure your coins, as I'm pretty sure I'm taking things a bit overboard to say the least.
