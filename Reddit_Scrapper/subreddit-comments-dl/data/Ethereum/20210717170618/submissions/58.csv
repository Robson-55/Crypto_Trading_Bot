7f7zot,1511535839,Ethereum for parking solutions?,My father is in a good position in the parking meter industry.  Ive been learning about smart contracts and Ethereum and it seems to be a perfect mobile solution for pay to park area.  The contract can have your variable rates based on time and high demand times. Transactions are quick and cheap.  I dont think it would be applicable for small town parking but in cities where you pay premiums I see it as a great option.  Parking authority payroll could be cut in half.  Im sure there would be a way to semi enforce fines using a smart contract as well.  \n\nAny input?
