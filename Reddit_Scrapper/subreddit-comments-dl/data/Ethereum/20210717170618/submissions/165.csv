He paid a guy on Fiverr to create a token for him. Guy gave him private key of the address/wallet the token was created on and then transferred the tokens on to his address.\n\nMy buddy is hoping someday to sell the tokens. He's concerned people will find it odd he's not using the contract address. Does this matter whether the coins are stored and passed out form the contract address or his personal address?\n\nI suppose he could send the tokens back to contract address but hypothetically the Fiverr freelancer kept the private key to this.

7llu64,1513993393,Help can't access wallet address,So I created a wallet in Jaxx and wrote down 12 word seed. Then went to mew and opened wallet with that seed. It showed me 4 addresses all empty of course. I copied the first address then edited mew. I re-entered mew with my ledger nano and sent some tokens to the address I had copied from the new wallet. Then I exited mew with the nano and re-entered using the 12 word seed. Now it showed 4 new addresses but not the one it had showed before. I can see the tokens in that original address in ether scan but I can't access them. Can someone please help. Is it possible to load up that original wallet address into mew or access it somehow with the 12 word seed? Any help much appreciated.

7lnagn,1514012520,IBO vs ICO,"Most startups in the blockchain industry currently use a method of crowdfunding known as ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings); ICO's often lead to unfair distributions of ICOtokens, to ""quick on the trigger"" buyers and ""whales"" with large holdings of digital currencies. As a consequence, markets become manipulated giving unfair benefits to these early individuals. Regular users are therefore left out when ICOs raise millions of dollars in digital currencies within minutes, and the future0 health of the network is adversely affected.\n\nThat is why the distribution of the UCASH is using an innovative new model the Initial Bounty Offering (IBO). Users can acquire tokens by completing bounties that help build the network. Bounties range from registering an account to translating the white paper to posting on social media. IBO's help grow the network and distribute tokens efficiently and fairly. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lnagn/ibo_vs_ico/,1,3

7lo4pf,1514027389,DAO's with incomes issuing a token,"Would this be theoretically possible:  \nYou have some set of smart contracts that handle transactions, that's what smart contracts do, right? Now these contracts could extract some tax on all the financial traffic going through them, right?  \nFor example [localethereum's escrow system?](https://blog.localethereum.com/how-our-escrow-smart-contract-works/) Perhaps the tax isn't sustainable in every case as someone could make a version without such fees that would naturally overtake all the traffic, but imagine there are dapps/DAO's which are going to generate income, this is sensible enough, no?  \nNow as long as the smart contracts have an income wouldn't it be nifty to release a single token as part of these smart contracts and holders of fractions of this token get equal fraction of the smart contracts' own income distributed to them periodically. Eg. if you have 0.5 of these tokens then when payday comes you get 0.5x of the total accumulated income.  \nThe token would be a kind of coded in stock option that guarantees dividends to whoever manages to get hold of the token. It would have value as long as the smart contracts keep generating income, theoretically forever (or in practice as long as the network is online and the dapp/DAO maintains an userbase). The weakness I foresee with this is that a dapp rarely is pure smart contract and usually requires a more or less centralized front-end which can go down, but if the front-end was eg. an open source project that was easy to set up by anyone and connected to the smart contracts then token holders could always try to bring it up again in case of server failure.  \nOther problems might be that if you lose your wallet holding this token then the income is just periodically burnt into a dead wallet and also if someone steals your tokens they will receive their cut of the profits just as if they were legitimate owners of the token, but in my opinion that's just all in the game so to speak. Another limitation is that as far as I know the dapp/DAO could only handle Ether and associated tokens for its income, right? What it exactly does is irrelevant, as long as it has an income!\n\nSo what do you think? Is someone doing something like this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lo4pf/daos_with_incomes_issuing_a_token/,1,2
