7r3q71,1516218775,Incentivizing 1-to-N transaction batching to relieve the network?,"One of the causes of increasing fees and congestion on the Ethereum network might be a lack of transaction batching. Particularly exchanges, which are an excellent match for such transactions, seem to submit many transactions rather than going through a 1-to-N transaction smart contract based on what is described in r/ethereum/comments/4fija2/is_this_true_ethereum_does_not_allow_multiple/d297dhb.\n\nIf I understand the implications correctly, implementing this might be a win/win situation since the exchanges are able to reduce transaction times/fees with a minimal amount of risk and effort. I'm personally not convinced that this optimization alone provides satisfactory incentive for exchanges to implement transaction batching though. So I'd love to hear some suggestions as to how this could be incentivized (if it is worth to incentivize in the first place).\n\nMy personal thoughts so far:\n\n- Have a reputed developer (Ethereum foundation or otherwise) provide as much of the implementation as possible, so the effort for exchanges is reduced to the absolute minimum\n\n- Provide an estimate of the impact on exchange performance/cost for different parameter values (time interval for batching pending withdrawals probably being a major one)\n\n- Provide a similar estimate of the impact on the Ethereum network when all the large volume exchanges would implement this. I'm sceptical of the impact of this last one, because I don't believe that altruism is a great motivator. But it's an interesting estimate to make nonetheless.\n\nI'm hoping that my assumptions are correct and that pushing for this could further reduce fees and congestion until more fundamental scaling solutions start to roll out.\n\nPaging u/avsa, u/nickjohnson, u/latelot, u/ItsAConspiracy, u/Dunning_Krugerrands somewhat randomly.\n\nEdit: It seems like this is also being discussed here at the moment: r/ethfinex/comments/7qoui9/are_you_going_to_implement_batched_withdrawals_to",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7r3q71/incentivizing_1ton_transaction_batching_to/,12,26

7r4szg,1516227316,"Vitalik Buterin Interview on ""Unchained"" Podcast","Vitalik Buterin did a long-form interview with Laura Shin (Senior Editor at Forbes) on her podcast ""Unchained"". It's a really good listen and very interesting to him talk, at length, about the challenges for Ethereum coming up. \n\nFor me, I am really interested in his ideas on distributed governance and his criticisms of SaaS companies. In terms of distributed governance, he notes that as much as ""Blockchain"" is often advertised as a way for software to algorithmically take over all decision-making processes, decision making will always need to include the human/emotional side of decision making that is sometimes irrational/illogical. He discusses that traditional tech companies, like Microsoft, may have the people's best interest at heart when it comes to their practices because they are selling a consumer product. If the product does something off to our data or we don't have control over that data, people are less inclined to use it. This is in comparison to a Facebook or Google where their product is derived from using our content (posts, searches, images) to sell to advertisers. This is an interesting take on why peer to peer systems can be truly revolutionary when it comes to owning our data on the network and then even being able to sell our own data to advertisers. \n\n**Anyways, take a listen yourself and share one or two things you learned/found interesting in this interview!**\n\n[**Episode Link**](http://unchainedpodcast.co/vitalik-buterin-creator-of-ethereum-on-the-big-guy-vs-the-little-guy)\n\nUnchained's Episode Introduction:\n\n&gt;The 23-year-old whiz dives into who blockchains will someday help, how we transition from Ethereum for digital cats to higher social impact, and why even big companies like JPMorgan, Microsoft and BP are using Ethereum. He also walks through some important technical challenges Ethereum faces with scaling and the shift from a proof-of-work consensus algorithm to proof of stake. And he reveals why he isn't a big believer in on-chain governance. Plus, he talks about his worries and gives us his predictions for 2018.\n\n&gt;Show notes: http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2018/01/09/vitalik-buterin-creator-of-ethereum-on-the-big-guy-vs-the-little-guy/\n\n&gt;Some of Vitalik's blog posts that we discussed: On token sales: http://vitalik.ca/general/2017/06/09/sales.html\n\n&gt;Interactive coin offerings: https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~teutsch/papers/ico.pdf\n\n&gt;Blockchain governance: http://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/17/voting.html",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7r4szg/vitalik_buterin_interview_on_unchained_podcast/,126,18
