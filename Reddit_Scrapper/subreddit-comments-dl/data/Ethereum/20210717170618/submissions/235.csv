7pom6u,1515682672,Gas limit estimation for software clients,"While gas price estimation getting implemented into software clients is a great thing, I think something needs to be done for gas limit estimation as well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but currently it seems like clients are using more or less hardcoded estimates. Would a good approach be to simulate the full transaction locally to get an exact gas limit estimate, possibly with a bit of headroom added to make up for potential state changes between the simulation and the execution of the transaction? Combined with gas price estimates it might allow for hiding these relatively low level details from the average end user entirely in the general case.
