7vvkmg,1518004232,If you want to do something pretty fucking cool,"# If you want to do something pretty fucking cool #\n\nBlockchain is not just a technological innovation\nbut radically changes the way our world works\n\nNever before has such a great power existed\nPeople are motivated to devote themselves to the project they believe in\nAnd take a financial stake from their beliefs\n\nNever before has such an equal opportunity existed\nWithout any third-party interference and without any limitation of time or location\nEveryone can participate and contribute freely\nThe project belongs to all the participants, rather than a specific person\n\nNever before has such a sensational network effect existed\nParticipants are not only users, but also developers and investors\nThis is a real world of crowd sourcing, crowd evaluating, crowd sharing, and crowd thinking \n\n\nIf you look for the right chance to get involved in the world of blockchain\nIf you desire to contribute your effort and to build a really fucking cool stuff\nPlease come to team up with us!\nWe welcome all minded individuals and all kinds of collaboration!\n\n\n\n# About Us #\n\nWe are building a completely decentralized trading world.\nIt can be regarded as [b]a globally decentralized &lt;Amazon+PayPal&gt; system[/b].\n\nIn this trading world\nAny two strangers could trade securely, freely and equally.\n\nThis is the revolution for the future business world.\n\n\n\n\n## **We have planned four stages** ##\n\n### Stage 1: Establish Cyber:// smart trading protocol ###\n\nCyber:// is based on the reliable computing environment of the blockchain and smart contracts.\nIt brings the function of 'Amazon + PayPal' from the Application Layer back to the Protocol Layer.\n\nBy just setting up a simple Cyber:// link for goods(tokens, goods or services), any users can share the link to others, allowing others to buy goods through this address anonymously, simply and reliably.\n\n\n\n### Stage 2: Decentralized C2C E-commerce System ###\n\n In the early stage, transactions between digital currency and legal currency will become the mainstream. Our team will build our first sample: a decentralized OTC platform (EasyOTC).\n\nApart from this, more and more transactions between digital currency and physical merchandise would also be made via Cyber:// protocol in the future.\n\n\n### Stage 3: Global Payment System ###\n\nIn order to achieve transactions among different legal currency regions, users can choose CYB, tokens issued by Cyber, or USDT to finish their transactions, which enables us to establish a global payment system beyond the legal currency limit based on the Cyber:// trading protocol.\n\n\n### Stage 4: Global Credit Information System ###\n\nThe data of each transaction will be recorded and accumulated comprehensively in the system, while Cyber:// will set up a credit information system for all users, which would ultimately support future transaction and credit services.\n\n\n\nOn the basis of Cyber:// smart trading protocol and its ecosystem, we will finally establish a globally shared economic infrastructure for the future business world, which enables developed countries to share the network and bandwidth resources with underdeveloped regions. \n\nCyber:// will definitely establish a new trading world.\n\n\n\n\n## **About our team now** ##\n\n\nWe are 5 hands-on serial entrepreneurs, with an average of 6 years’ entrepreneurial experience\nWe used to serve as CEOs in our original companies\nBut Cyber makes us desperately all in\n\nIn the original entrepreneurial environment of the Internet, every one of us is a team.\nIn the blockchain world, embracing more teams and collaboration can really move towards tomorrow.\n\nAll of us are experts at different things.\nSome of us began to research and develop Bitcoin Miner in 2013\nSome of us are a full stack engineers in blockchain\nSome of us have acquired tens of millions of users with “0” cost\nSome of us are excelled at designing and video production\nSome of us have received millions of dollars of investments with a single BP\n\nWhat's more\nEveryone’s product has got millions or even tens of millions of users\nWe know that there are bubbles and speculators now\nBut we want to use our technology and our products to contribute to the whole blockchain system\n\n**Build a really FUCKING COOL stuff!**\n\n**Put our stamp on the blockchain world!**\n\n\n\n\n## **Who will be with us?** ##\n\nIf you are really interested in Cyber, \neven if you don't know how you might contribute right now,\nplease don’t hesitate to join us.\n\nIf you are willing to put in effort, we would love to have you.\n\nHelps if you are good at followings:\ncoding\nalgorithm\ndesign\nmathematics\neconomics\n\nWith your participation, we are not strong, we are formidable!\n\n\n\n\n## **Contact Us** ##\n\n\nour telegram group:\ncyber official global group\nhttps://t.me/cyberofficialglobal\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7vvkmg/if_you_want_to_do_something_pretty_fucking_cool/,0,2

7vwrh1,1518016724,How can Ethereum compete with other Blockchain platforms that are more developer friendly?,"To preface, I'm a long time holder of Ethereum and a big believer in their team and technology.  That being said, I've had a few interesting conversations recently that have raised a concern.\n\nI'm wondering if you guys think Ethereum can compete with other Blockchain platforms that are written in traditional programming languages.  I believe that network effect of developer adoption is going to be huge in determining which platform succeeds in the long term.  If the value of a platform is largely determined by the usage of the applications built on top of it, then the size of the developer population that can build apps on that platform will correlate highly with the quality and quantity of apps on that platform.  \n\nThis is why I am wondering how something like Ethereum, which has its own programming language (solidity), can compete with other platforms that will allow programming in languages that many developers already know.
