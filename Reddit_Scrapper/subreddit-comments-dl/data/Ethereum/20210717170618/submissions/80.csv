7gvkzj,1512141211,Enthusiastic fellow looking for a community management job in the Ethereum ecosystem.,"Hi there,\n\nYesterday was a very big day for me.\n\nI finally had the courage to take the big step and resign from a fulltime dayjob as a banker in order to focus one hundred percent on crypto!\n\nSince having met crypto in 2013 it has kept growing on me. Now the force of decentralization just has become too heavy and I had to give in. This decision ultimately feels very natural and I am very motivated to contribute where ever possible in the Ethereum ecosystem.\nI hope some of the people reading this could forward me any projects looking for someone like me (people wanting to help manage a slackroom / Discord / Twitter / Telegram of a project / ‚Ä¶).\n\nI‚Äôm not a programmer, but I‚Äôm very good with people and I know my way around crypto (exchanges / decentralized exchanges / community management and have a general good understanding of how everything works).\n\nLately I‚Äôve been giving crypto-consultancy to a VC firm aswell. I read a lot on different projects, follow a lot of the better quality crypto personalities and watch the conferences whenever uploaded. I speak fluently in English, Dutch, French and a bit of German.\n\nSo yea, drop me a DM üòä\n\nGreetings! \n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7gvkzj/enthusiastic_fellow_looking_for_a_community/,25,8

7gvwdt,1512144076,Understanding More About Ethereum,"I've been doing some preliminary research on Ethereum and I would really appreciate if anyone had the time to verify my understanding, answer a couple questions (I'd love a discussion), and link me to some outside resources/articles.\n\n**My Understanding of the Blockchain:**\n\n* Ethereum currently runs on a proof-of-work style blockchain, there is a plan to move Ethereum to a proof-of-stake style blockchain in there future\n\n**What I'd Like to Learn About the Blockchain:**\n\n* When is this change scheduled to take place, what are the pros and cons of switching to this system\n\n**My Understanding of the Mining Process:** \n\n* The average time for a block to be solved is around 14 seconds (we are seeing around 6100 blocks mined per day)\n\n* 3 Ethereum is the reward for each block mined (under the current system)\n\n**What I'd Like to Learn About the Mining Process:** \n\n* Although there is currently no determined hard cap on Ethereum like there is on Bitcoin, is there any schedule along the lines of halving rewards\n\n**My Understanding of Ethereum as a Currency:**\n\n* Each Ether is divisible into 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei, making it great for microtransactions\n\n* Ethereum possesses a transparent Blockchain \n\n* Ethereum is transferable at incredibly high speeds **(I believe they are tied to how long it takes for blocks to be mined as thats what updates the blockchain, please correct me if wrong)**, making them transferable in around a 14s time frame\n\n* Similar to other Blockchain tech, this should eliminate the middle man/intermediary\n\n**What I'd Like to Learn About Ethereum as a Currency:**\n\n* How much anonymity comes with transactions? Is this something that could earn a bad rep due to the dark market, or is that a market that is favoring Monero\n\n* What timeline could we be looking at for Ethereum to become a more mainstream form of payment (I'd assume we're looking at years as the unit of measurement) \n\n* Is the currency itself only programmable via smart contracts (could I program the currency itself so it can only be used to buy goods from 'Store X' and if it hasn't been by 'Time Y' I can have them returned to me)\n\n**My Understanding of Smart Contracts (not too strong):**\n\n* Ownership of things like cars and houses can be uploaded into these smart contracts (can eliminate the need to verify these things with outside parties for $$$ fees)\n\n* They are first paid for and then set to yield a result when a certain set of events has been completed/clauses have been met\n\n* They can feature expiration dates\n\n* Make transferring portions of what you own easy (I can sell my 1/3rd stake in something, or go in with 10 people to buy a house)\n\n**What I'd Like to Learn About Smart Contracts:**\n\n* Can this type of tech be implemented towards things like mortgages, leases (I'd assume so)\n\n* Even though its in Java (pretty big upside), won't there be somewhat of a middleman due to the fact that a large portion of the population won't be able to code these conditions\n\n* What are smart contracts tied to, is it limited to one smart contract per block mined, how are these attained and is there any scarcity to this\n\n**My Understanding of DAPPS:**\n\n* These start ups come to the market in the form of ICOs\n\n* A lot of these start ups possess no value proposition (obviously some still do), but this kind of strikes me as something that could resemble a dotcom bubble and bust if they ever explode into the mainstream\n\n* This appears to be one of the big drivers of Ethereum's future upside\n\n**What I'd Like to Learn About DAPPs:** \n\n* Is there anywhere I can find a downloadable list of ICO history/activity (other than Coindesk)\n\n* How tightly correlated is the future growth of Ethereum and the state of DAPPs and their ICOs\n\n* How threatened is the ICO market to certain countries beginning to pay attention and consider regulating it\n\n* What time frame do you guys see for these hitting mainstream\n\n**Miscellaneous Questions:**\n\n* Is gas referring to the transaction costs of Ethereum\n\n* Any big news on the horizon (spent lots of time trying to learn, haven't been to up to date with any major changes)\n\n* Do you guys think Ethereum at its current state is predominantly from it trading as a speculative commodity (with the future upside being as it stabilizes in value, establishes itself as a currency, and the DAPPs market expands) or do you think there are more underlying drivers\n\nI appreciate if you made it this far. I don't expect anyone to have definitive answers to all these questions, but these are things I would love to read up on and have a discussion on.\n\nI hope to join you guys in the future (hopefully sometime soon) as an investor in both Ether and the DAPPs it spawns",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7gvwdt/understanding_more_about_ethereum/,23,9
