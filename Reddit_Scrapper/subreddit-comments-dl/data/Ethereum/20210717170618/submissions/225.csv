7p7kis,1515509699,What does the Ethereum community consider a reasonable txn price?,"The title says is all but I'll expand on the question. \n\nWith the rising price of ether so is the transaction cost, in fiat. In the past to battle congestion the Ethereum network miners have raised their Gas limit per block to include more transactions which should lower the gas price (gwei). Would the network be willing to do the same purely on reasoning that ether has risen in price? \n\nDoes the Ethereum community have a certain value, whether in fiat, ether or gwei, that it would like its transactions to maintain?\n\nDo you have a limit you would let it reach before reducing? $5,  0.002 eth, 75 gwei ???\n\nHow long must this limit be sustained before increasing the Gas limit?\n\n---\n**My Opinion**\n\nEthereum is meant to be a platform you can **use** not a hodl meme fest. I think the txns should remain cheap in fiat that way we don't price out new users buying in regardless of the price of ether. This will allow new users to see the power of Ethereum at a low cost.\n\nPersonally would not want the txn fee,for a safe slow transaction, to raise above $1 for a sustained period.  I'm okay with people in a rush or wanting to pay double that to get into the next block. \n\nBut hey, maybe I'm just cheap.\n\nLinks:\n\n[ethergasstation](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php)\n\n[txn pool data](https://ethgasstation.info/txPoolReport2.php)\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7p7kis/what_does_the_ethereum_community_consider_a/,19,18

7p7t4s,1515511952,"Etherions updates: cheaper whelps, feeding &amp; battle systems &amp; more","People have been asking for updates and more information about the game with PMs so instead of replying to them all individually, here we go, more information about our belowed Etherions game:  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n**Short overview for newcomers**  \nEtherions is a 3D dapp, a game where you interact with digital Dragons, called Etherions. You can hatch them, feed them, trade them, battle with them for now. They start as hatchlings and can potentially evolve/grow to powerful creatures. With each passing day their powers grow, including health points and ability strength, which you can track. In your nursery they play with their siblings and discover their abilities. It is basically a collectibles game where you can buy cute hatchlings stored on the Ethereum blockchain.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nDev of the game, */u/Convergence-* got offers for help from several people. I got chosen to help him out in the process of bringing the game closer to you, the gamers. He will focus on making the game work, I will focus on getting it to the community. So for any questions feel free to PM me, */u/TomiSharked*. You can also visit the the *[website](https://www.etherions.com)*, our *[Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Etherions/)* or *[Discord](https://discord.gg/75paXTy)*.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n**Cheaper Dragons**  \nWe heard you! Happy to announce there are now 2 cheaper options to get started: Red and Yellow Etherion whelps, priced at 0.01 and 0.025 ETH. The difference is that these 2 smaller Dragons have their age-cap set at 60 days at which point they will be larger whelps, while the original dragons can grow up to 1 year in size, at which time those should be some *[big-ass dragons](https://www.etherions.com/images/mature.jpg)*.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nSome more info about the games systems:  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n**The Feeding sytem**  \nThe intial plan is for feedings to be stored on the blockchain for bigger Dragons only. That means while the whelps only need to be fed small animals (such as rats or chickens) without any tx fee and just for fun, once the Dragons get up to the size of eating say whole cows, those feedings could potentially be stored on the blockchain. Say 150+ days after birth.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n**The Battle system**  \nOnce your whelps reach a certain age and strength, they may be able to do battle with other Dragons. Older Dragons are bigger and more powerful (making them more valuable). Rarer etherions have slightly better or more unique fighting abilities. Since this system is still under development we like to ask the community if they prefer a turn-based battle system or go for the more realistic realtime battle system, the latter of which will be more centralized and takes longer to develop (especially by one guy).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n**Modular Contracts**  \nOne of the features of smart contracts is, is that they can't be changed anymore after deployment. This has advantages and disadvantages. One disadvantage is, that if you find bugs, (the eternal bane of developers), or want to add new features to the dapp, that is essentially impossible. You can always deploy a new contract at a new address with the changes, but if your dapp stores data like kitties, dragons or houses, then migrating that data is a PITA that costs a lot of gas and transactions (afaik). A solution that we used would be to use modular contracts: one contract only stores data and does nothing more, then another contract handles the logic and things subject to change, such as features. And you can upgrade those 'helper-contracts' without touching the stored data.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nLong term plans include the aforementioned Feeding and Fighting systems along with trading but could be more depending on the community. We will follow what will be most popular, so any suggestions are welcome - we will pick what's best for the game and players.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nAt this moment you could see the game as a ""hold-game-asset-for-profit type"" but this is just the beginning. With adding of different gameplay elements we will enhance the value of your Dragons and the gameplay aspect itself.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n*You can check it out and get started here:  \n[https://www.etherions.com](https://www.etherions.com)*  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nIf you have any further questions or suggestions, please let us know! ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7p7t4s/etherions_updates_cheaper_whelps_feeding_battle/,12,9

Some are skeptical about crypto as a means of payment and I know we are far from that being implemented as a source of settlement. I am more interested in it as a means of a smart contract between client/customer as well as a safe and secure means of recording data regarding a project.\n\nWhat areas of smart contracts/blockchain should I focus on in order to show my company that early adoption will save us time and money and allow our documentation to be immutable?\n\nI know that projects like WTC/VEN are changing supply chain and also have their tech being implemented in smart cities in China though I believe their partnerships are still under NDA so there is not much information about the current state of those projects.
