AFAIK none in production, noone had the incentive to hack so far. \n\n2.\n-Public chains: designed to survive given a certain amount of malicious actors.\n\n-Private chains: If a malicious actor sneaks in, he can deal damage.

Simply an atomic ETH to Token swap. To my surprise I haven't found one yet. Instead I found contract factories and stumbled across a lot of contracts that have ""owner"". Can someone please explain to me why a(n escrow) contract should have an owner? Contracts for me are universal libraries that anyone can use. Why should I use a contract factory to create a new smart contract that does the same as its clones but having me as owner? \n\nTo me it makes absolutely no sense for a library to be restricted to one (and his/her exchange partner) specified user/account, even if the ownership is transferable. Contracts should be *UNIVERSAL* and usable by anyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7rij87/why_is_contract_ownership_a_thing/,1,4
