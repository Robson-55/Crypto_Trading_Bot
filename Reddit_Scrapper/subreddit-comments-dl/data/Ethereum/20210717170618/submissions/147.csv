I am trying to turn it into a full node but I have been just downloading the blockchain for like 3 days. It's seems to just download about 12 to 50 thousand blocks and stop. I keep having to come back throughout the day and close the program and reopen it to keep it moving. I know I will get there, but I guess what I really want to know is will making this computer a full node be the greatest help to the network? There was a post about the need for more light server clients the other day and if that will help the network more I will just do that.
