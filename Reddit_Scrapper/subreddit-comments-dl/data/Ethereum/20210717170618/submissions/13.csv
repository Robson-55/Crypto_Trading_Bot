7b8v2o,1510008589,Questions about offline storage.,"I am not a big fan of hardware devices that can be lost or damaged, so I am curious about the various offline options like the paper key exports / local wallets etc that can be backed up in more than one place.\nWhat isn't clear to me is if there is simply a fundamental public private key pair that makes a ""wallet"" in the blockchain that any client can import or if each wallet is storing a much more complex asset that is just encrypted with a key. The various guides are wallet specific and seem to dance around the issue to a degree.\nI note that there are paper wallets but only MyEtherWallet.com seems to be creating these.. Are these paper wallets dependant on MyEtherWallet in some way to be recovered? What if there is another fork?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7b8v2o/questions_about_offline_storage/,1,6
