7r5y4m,1516237327,Difference between tokens and blockchain,"I need your help for my research. Before I meditate deeply on when a solution/service needs a smart contract functionality vs a blockchain of its own. \n\nSome of todays Erc-20 seem to act as a blockchain when its not. The over confidence that a token can do what a blockchain can is troubling me. \n\nIt is predicted that there will be millions of blockchains. Marketplace solutions should run a blockchain of their own. Kitties for example are a too big venture for Ethereum platform that was designed for running smart contacts. Unless the platform could scale close to infinitely. \n\nTokens act as a currency and a standalone product when its primary use was crowdfunding and light utility. \n\nIf anyone is following even in the slightest, please share your thoughts, anything. When do you think a project needs to be a standalone blockchain, and when a token atop Ethereum or similar. How does it all boil down for intercurrency operation, exchange and maybe even interoperability. With so many currencies, ease of use becomes troubling.

7r66mt,1516239480,Admittedly NOOB question about Ethereum dapps/smart contracts and the necessity of tokens,"Simply put, the question is ""are tokens necessary for some technical reason or are they not necessary in most cases?"" \n\nFor example, the upcoming Bee Token ICO. Is there any reason why the contract can't can't simply use ETH as the currency within the ecosystem instead of having it's own token? \n\nI get the economics, it's a form of VC and arguably may protect the project from fluctuations in ETHs price.  But from a technical standpoint, is it necessary? \n\nSo I believe the answer is ""no"" for almost every ICO (please correct me if I am wrong). \n\nBut, I also believe I understand why a few privacy related things like ENG need their own token (b/c it's all off chain and that's the point). So for those protocols actually complimenting the system and adding off chain functionality I think I get that they can't use ETH for obvious reasons (ETH lives of the chain).\n\nSo what other projects need tokens? Can anyone help me make sense of when a project having its own token makes sense and when it's just funding? \n\nIf anyone can just point me to a resource I'm happy to read into it but I haven't found a good answer yet and nobody I ask seems to have one.
