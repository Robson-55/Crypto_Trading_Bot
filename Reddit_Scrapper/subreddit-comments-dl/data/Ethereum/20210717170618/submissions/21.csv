7bp2xm,1510181301,Ethereum - The most efficient way for me (or anyone) to get started?,"Hello, r/Ethereum. (/rEthtrader, too, I don't know how to crosspost!)\n\n\n\nIt's my hope that in the future I can be involved in something significant, and I'm betting on blockchain, crypto to be more precise, and Ethereum to be specific.\n\n\n\n**What I want to know is, what programming languages, software etc am I best learning right now, so that one day I can be as knowledgeable (hands on) about Ethereum as possible. How to understand, write, deploy smart contracts, and so on.**\n\n\n\nI have a very limited understanding of Blockchain/Crypto/Ethereum compared to the majority of the this subreddit (I imagine) and have almost zero programming knowledge, so I'll be starting from square one.\n\n\n\nI'm a ""fast learner""^everyone ^thinks ^that ^about ^themselves ^lol and would like to jump straight in, what should I start learning right now to get the best start possible? I'm under no illusion that it'll be easy or that I'll ever *understand* the inner workings properly, but I want to try.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7bp2xm/ethereum_the_most_efficient_way_for_me_or_anyone/,11,8
