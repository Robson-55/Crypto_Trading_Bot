7kskg6,1513681012,Mist client slows down computer to unusable speed,"Hi there,\n\nI wanted to play around a bit with ethereum and thought it'd be best to start out with the official client. So I downloaded the current version (0.9.3 ; 64bit ; .deb) . And installed it on my (Debian Stretch) System.\n\nWhen I try to run it, it downloads blocks, but it makes the whole computer just unusably slow. Using the ""close wallet"" function closes the window, but everything stays slow. The task manager indicates that there are still threads running (including miners).\n\nIs there any way to disable those functions and reduce it to pure wallet management? (My machine is a laptop, and certainly not fit to mine.)\n\nGreetings,\ngnord\n\nEdit, additional information: I have a symmetric gigabit internet connection, so the whole peer-to-peer thing should not be the problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7kskg6/mist_client_slows_down_computer_to_unusable_speed/,10,2

These are contracts that execute when certain conditions from all parties are met, without the need for intermediaries. And litecoin, which has faster transition times than bitcoin, wants to be the de factor currency for paying for things. While ripple wants to be the main currency to help facilitate cross-border payments.\n\nCompare [block times for Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime) (avg 15 secs) to [Litecoin](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/litecoin-confirmationtime.html) (avg 2.5 mins)\n\nCompare [average tx fee for Ethereum](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3m) (avg 25 cents pre-cryptokitties) to [Litecoin](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/litecoin-transactionfees.html#3m) (avg 20 cents pre-recent pump). In recent days both have spiked.\n\nEther seems like better P2P-cash than Litecoin. It would be awesome if Vitalik discussed this more often rather than focusing exclusively on the EVM message.
