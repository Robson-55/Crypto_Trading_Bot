I‚Äòve seen today that an already placed token transaction, which i could find on etherscan, suddenly disappeared. I‚Äòve send token to another address, while sending the last ETH in the Account (2. Transaction) to another address. Shouldn‚Äòt the ETH not be reserved for the token transaction? Or is there a time lack through the smart contract process in the background?\n\nA question beside this: Are you experienced in web3 transaction scripting with tokens or a smart contract developer and do you have time for a little chat, contact me pls via pm!\n\nThanks in advance and kind regards!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7hi5oh/scripting_erc20_token_transactions_is_it_possible/,0,1

7hie3y,1512404832,How the crypto kitty marketing gimmick is hurting the network.,"To start: I get it they are cute. They are visible. you can tweet about them. \n\nBut they are clogging the network either through poor design or as a marketing gimmick. The network disruption is causing some to think that massive numbers of transactions are happening(they are) and that their is a rush on fake cats(not really)\n\nRough math for marketing guys and gals out there: Assuming a max of ~10tx per sec (that's high)  we are limited to  315 million tx per year. or 886k per day =  37k per hour = 615 per minute, So if you want to be an asshole. set up a bot that will call a low value function on your tx, set gas to minimum and lock the network. Everyone will see your contract is doing ""such big numbers!"" and you are a rockstar \n\nThe [kittycore contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d)  lists a [CEO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2041bb7d8b49f0bde3aa1fa7fb506ac6c539394c), [CFO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaf1e54b359b0897133f437fc961dd16f20c045e1), and [COO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa21037849678af57f9865c6b9887f4e339f6377a) account for admin reasons(which is cool and more contracts should do this) \n\nThe problem is that some people are too into breeding cats. I stare at tx pools all day, I notice these kinds of things. Low cost operations that are called at high frequency. For example, account [0xa21](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa21037849678af57f9865c6b9887f4e339f6377a) has called either autobreed or give birth 23k times in the last 20 hours. This account is funded and controlled by the CFO account. THe CFO account also was responsiable for the [0xba52](https://etherscan.io/address/0xba52c75764d6f594735dc735be7f1830cdf58ddf) that called a TON of `createPromoKitty`contracts in a short period of time. \n\nSo if its a gimmick, neat congrats you win at marketing. If it is a requirement of your dapp to do this many tx, WTF make a state channel or side chain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7hie3y/how_the_crypto_kitty_marketing_gimmick_is_hurting/,3,20
7hieid,1512404929,Max gas price for cryptokitties?,"I have nothing against little kitties, and love that a non-exchange dApp is getting this level of exposure.\n\nOne simple way to make the network more usable (I have 7 GWei txs pending for 30 mins at this point) would be to enforce a maximum gas price in the CryptoKitties contract of say 4 GWei. This would mean anyone can still use the network quickly for non-cat related business by using a &gt; 4 GWei gas price, and those who want cats would still get mined (possibly with a bit of a delay)...\n\nThoughts?
