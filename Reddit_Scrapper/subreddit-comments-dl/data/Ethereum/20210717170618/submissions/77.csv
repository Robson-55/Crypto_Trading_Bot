I want to discuss what's said before the author starts shilling IOTA.\n\nThis are the quotes that got me thinking. \n&gt; Financial rewards will always create inequality. By paying someone to run the network, you are giving away your power. By giving away your power, the system becomes unbalanced: there are few powerful players and the large, powerless base. The base cannot exist without the powerful miners, who get more and more powerful as the time progresses.\n\n&gt; You might argue, that Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will solve everything, but it is just shifting the problem. In PoS whoever has the biggest pile of coins runs the show, so to speak. So you exchanged hashrate for wealth, which is just the same. It might be better for the environment, but doesn‚Äôt solve the problem of centralisation.\n\n&gt; PoW, PoS or whatever. As long as it rewards the miners, it puts them above and beyond the system. The only motive for miners to keep everything running is money. \n\n&gt; Hence, when it comes to upgrades of the blockchain, they will always put their own selfish interests first. The users are not happy? Well, fork the chain and let‚Äôs see who has more (hashrate) power. \n\nSo if any of this is wrong I'm interested in knowing why.

7go3ea,1512063945,A high level and non-technical explanation of what Ethereum is for people who aren't programmers.,"I made a post here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7ggsfu/if_and_that_is_an_if_we_are_entering_a_correction/dqjbuju/ \n\nAnd many of you suggested making this it's own thread, and I will repost it below. I know there is a lot of information out there about Ethereum, but a lot of it is honestly not designed or written to be read by people who are not programmers or computer scientists. Since Ethereum is under active development, and is only just getting started, I've found material that explains things at a higher level is lacking or just plain completely missing. Below is my explanation that I hope can help you investors in this technology understand exactly what it is you're investing in. Ethereum **is not** Bitcoin - *far* from it. I hope this will clear things up, especially for those investors that just blindly buy token sales for products or solutions that are actually not even possible or would make no sense to use Ethereum for. Unfortunately it seems like 8/10 token sales at the moment fall under this (you know... meme-tier bootstrap.js website)\n\n#As high level and as layman like as I can make it: \n\nWhen you buy Ethereum, you are buying ""work units"" in a **massive** super computer and cloud network spanning the entire globe. ETH, although it can be exchanged for currency or used as currency, is actually used to incentivize nodes on the Etherum network to process information and data for you. This is called gas, paid in fractions of an ETH 'coin' (like 0.00000010 ETH). This is unlike with bitcoin, which is intended to be used purely for financial transactions. Ethereum can do that too, but it can also say, run javascript-like code on a webpage - or host static content like image files. Now instead of paying Amazon or Google Cloud Services hundreds of dollars per month in hosting a virtual machine (basically a server within a server), you can host entire websites for PENNIES per month, or even a one time cost of just a few cents! Storing or changing the data costs money, but it's a one time cost. Retrieving the data is free. This is where smart contracts come in. If you need to store ""memory"" on the blockchain, contracts do that. It only costs money to write in or change that data - or to *do something* with that data. Not to retrieve it. So say if you host an image on the Ethereum blockchain through the SWARM protocol, users can retrieve that data by pointing to it's hash. Really the website administrator would do this, and you'd have no idea. You'd load images from the Ethereum network in your browser without realizing it. It looks/acts/behaves like a normal website, but underneath is a series of extremely complicated mathematics (aptly called mathemagic) that make the most widely used encryption today look like crayon drawings.   \n\nNow say if your code used memory, like having a number field in the web page and then displaying double that number, you would have to send data to that **smart contract** and it would *store the data in memory*, then *do work with it* and finally *output the result*. The parts that cost gas are the storing and doing. Now say if the user wants to recall the calculation they made a minute ago, or submits the exact same number as before. They can do this without needing to resubmit to the contract, all history is stored within the blockchain. That previous transaction will be recorded there forever. So as more things are done on the blockchain, the more efficient computing becomes. You only have to calculate or *do the thing* **once**. And *never have to waste precious CPU time again*. You can simply recall that previous transaction. Never before with computing has something like this even been possible, and for us tech guys the concept is just mind blowing. It has so many applications and will completely disrupt and overthrow big cloud providers today. We're talking slashing IT operating costs by 90%. In the applications I have developed for it, I was able to make websites that would normally cost $120 a month to host down to just a single one time cost of $0.12 to host static content and $7 a month for the rest. It's like watching the rise of the internet all over again for those 'in the know'. \n\nNext time you buy Ethereum, or sell it - remember what you're *actually* trading. Bitcoin ain't got nothing on what Ethereum is about to become. And all those people who are just buying it for investment just don't know what the hell they're sitting on top of. If bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is digital black-gold. And you just accumulated it before the next industrial revolution.   \n\nI hope I was able to keep it within the realm someone non-technical can understand. If you have any other questions, I'll be happy to answer all you can throw at me. There's a whole ton of information out there on Ethereum, but most of it isn't aimed or written for the 99% of people who aren't programmers.
