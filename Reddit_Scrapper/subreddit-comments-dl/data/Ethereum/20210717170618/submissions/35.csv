7cx3ia,1510679850,[Question] Why is the reward to mine a valid block much more than to disrupt the network?,"In the ethereum white paper, there is this sentence(right before the merkle tree section):\n\n&gt; An attacker with immense computing power can redo the proof of work (PoW) for a considerate amount of blocks and can eventually gain a lot of bitcoins but as described in Satoshi's paper,[1a] the reward to mine a valid block is much more than to disrupt the network. But in light of falling mining rewards the same does not hold true.\n\nI was curious as to how mining rewards is better than disrupting the network, as profit from malicious double spending is unbounded.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7cx3ia/question_why_is_the_reward_to_mine_a_valid_block/,2,7

7cx95k,1510681143,Contentious hardfork incoming?,"There are considerable sums locked up in contracts. These can't be released unless there is a protocol change. I don't doubt this can be done with a very small change. But,\n\n1. There can be unforeseen side effects. Contracts that were supposed to lock funds, maybe burn funds, can suddenly have a new state they were not prepared for.\n2. A hardfork is never risk free.\n3. It will confirm a view that Ethereum is weak on immutability.\n4. A hardfork will probably be sugared by some substantial donations to various organizations and stakeholders. That is one of the weaker points of blockchains, using a bribe attack.\n5. The community will experience a severe rift, with a lot of alienation. There is a high risk of falling prices. This will make coin holders angry, and the situation can get very ugly.\n6. The hardfork from theDAO could be excused because the technology was immature. Using the same excuse again is problematic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7cx95k/contentious_hardfork_incoming/,0,32

7cxkot,1510683721,Question about 1 ETH requirement to make Smart Contracts,"Un the Ethereum Wallet GUI, I see 'Once you have more than 1 Ether you can create more sophisticated contracts. Wallets are smart contracts that allow your funds to be controlled by multiple accounts. They can have an optional daily limit on withdrawals to increase security. Create your own custom contracts on the Contracts tab.'\n\nWhere is the limit of requiring 1 ETH enforced? Is it possible to create smart contracts if one has less than 1 ETH (ie is this text wrong)?\n\nI have not seen anything in the mechanics of Ethereum about how or why the creation of a Smart Contract requires 1 ETH, would someone please explain it further to me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7cxkot/question_about_1_eth_requirement_to_make_smart/,1,1
