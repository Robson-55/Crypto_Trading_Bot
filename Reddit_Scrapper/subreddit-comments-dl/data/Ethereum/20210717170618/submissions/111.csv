7ikt1w,1512795722,"[Update] Crypto Contacts - I got sick of moving from app to app &amp; website to website to copy my crypto addresses while away from my computer, so I made an app to help organize.","I posted 3 weeks ago about the release of my free crypto public key organization app on Android and I wanted to update. I got a few kind words of support and suggestions so I thought I'd come back and thank all of you that have tried my app so far. \n\nI'm here to say that I've added a currency conversion calculator to the app, address share option, and direct ways to contact me via email or social media. \n\nI've also contacted crypto compare to get a list of exchanges and which currencies each exchange supports so I can implement options to choose which exchange you get your pricing info from.\n\nI'm also looking into password protection and encryption but that one might take a while because I want to make sure I dont mess up anyones stored info when I roll out the update. \n\nFeedback always welcome and if the app is useful, please share with your networks. Every user counts towards me going full time on this, which I would love to do! :D\n\n\nIf you haven't checked it out yet, heres the link:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alignmentapps.cryptocontacts\n\n",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ikt1w/update_crypto_contacts_i_got_sick_of_moving_from/,1,2

7ilg7c,1512804309,Block chain noob question,As far as I understand if you do a transaction in eth or bitcoin you pay a fee to miners so that your transaction is validated in the new block. I hope I’m correct until that point because now comes the question:\n\nWhat happens when btc or eth mined the last coin? As far as I know they are booth limited to a max number of coins correct?\n\nHow will transactions be validated if there is no more mining?\n\n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ilg7c/block_chain_noob_question/,13,13
