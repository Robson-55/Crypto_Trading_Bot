**CRYPTOCURRENCIES TRADING BOT**

This projects aims at developing an algorithm composed of several pieces of code, in which some cryptocurrencies prices are predicted. Based on these predictions, an investment fund of cryptocurrencies will be established on Enzyme, with its corresponding wallet address so that it can be easily accesible for people who would like to invest.
In this project, a Reddit scrapper will be used in order to get comments and submissions from Reddit in the past years. Those news will be passed through a pretrained transformer (GPT-2) in order to analyze its sentiment score. Once this step is done, another scrapper will be used in order to get the historic of pricesand volumes from a selected set of crypto assets on a daily basis. This information will be merged with the sentiment scores for each day. After all this information is gathered, it will be passed through a deep learning LSTM model in order to be trained with it and output the price predictions for each cryptocurrency.  
For future news, Cryptopanic (news aggregator from several sources beyond Reddit) will be used. The transformer will be feeded with all this news and give as output its sentiment score, averaging by day. After this is done, this information will be merged with new daily prices, volumes... in order to keep on predicting future prices.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The goal of this project is to gain on medium term investment (1-3 months) through sentiment analysis and price analysis.



### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

We suggest to create a virtual environment for python and continue with the installation.


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Robson-55/Crypto_Trading_Bot.git
   ```

2. Install REQUIRMENT.txt packages
   ```sh
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once Installed all requirements, run the coingecko scrapper and reddit scrappers with the following comands.

 ```sh
   python3 Coingecko_Scrapper/Price_Scrapper.py
   python python3 Reddit_Scrapper/subreddit-comments-dl/src/subreddit_downloader.py Ethereum --batch-size 50 --laps 800 --reddit-id <reddit_id> --reddit-secret <reddit_secret> --reddit-username <reddit_username> --utc-after 1589459201
   python3 Reddit_Scrapper/subreddit-comments-dl/src/dataset_builder.py 
   python3 Reddit_Scrapper/subreddit-comments-dl/dataset_formater.py
   ```

After both have run, run the following scripts to clean and merge the data separe:

1. KNN
   ```sh
   python Python/Models/KNN.py
   ```
2. LogReg
   ```sh
   python Python/Models/LogReg.py
   ```
3. NN
   ```sh
   python Python/Models/NN.py
   ```
4. LSTM
   ```sh
   python Python/Models/LSTM.py
   ```
5. SVM
   ```sh
   python Python/Models/SVM.py
   ```
